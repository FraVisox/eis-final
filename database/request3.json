The dotcom boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s made a fortune for the brave souls who backed a plethora of small start-ups that are now giants of the stock market, such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook. Plenty also lost their shirts with punts on the “next big thing”. Elon Musk knows more than most about this tricky game of risk and reward. The entrepreneur founded and sold software company Zip2 for $305m to Compaq; he also established online payment giant PayPal, which was sold to eBay for $1.5bn. Musk’s latest venture, Tesla, has again asked investors to get the crystal ball out and to imagine what the business – a pioneer in the growth markets of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage – might become. The naysayers believe Tesla’s current $60bn valuation (around the same as General Motors) is already wildly optimistic for what is essentially a loss-making luxury car manufacturer. Musk, however, who also has a rocket and space exploration venture, SpaceX, seems to believe that not even the sky is the limit. Even compared with the bullish financial modelling that has propelled Tesla to its current valuation, its new executive pay targets outlined last week look pretty ambitious. According to the package, Musk will continue to not take a salary but could ultimately earn $55bn in a series of stock option payments if Tesla can turbocharge its market valuation to a dizzying $650bn within 10 years. However, Musk noted: “If all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla’s value grows by 80% or 90%, then my amount of compensation would be zero.” Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide and recently launched the Model 3 saloon, a more affordable “mass market” electric car that is key to its efforts to become profitable. Until now, Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the car, so it is no surprise to see that the proposed bonus plan no longer includes vehicle output targets, which were included in previous compensation deals. Instead, Musk will be paid stock options in 12 tranches that vest over 10 years. To secure each tranche, Musk must hit a pair of milestones – one linked to Tesla’s market value, the other to revenue and profitability. Every tranche depends on Tesla’s market value increasing by $50bn. If he hits all 12 targets and increases Tesla’s valuation from $60bn to $650bn, plus revenue of $175bn and earnings of $14bn, Musk’s shares bonus could pay out the full $55bn. Christian Stadler, a professor of strategic management who researches the car industry at Warwick Business School, said: “It’s hugely ambitious. In terms of revenue, the targets are even more ambitious. At $175bn we are talking about 17 times what they had in revenue last year. Considering the biggest problem is on the operational side of the business, it makes it harder still to achieve than the market valuation.” Musk is certainly being asked to do a lot. Tesla’s last quarter saw it score just under $3bn of revenue, but make a net loss of $619m. At one point last year, the California-based company was burning through $8,000 every 60 seconds, according to Bloomberg. It also has a habit of missing its own production deadlines. This month, it pushed back production targets for the Model 3 for the second time. An even bigger concern than Tesla’s own stuttering performance is that the giants of the automotive world are stirring. VW, Ford, Toyota, GM and Nissan are preparing an assault on the electric vehicle market that will see them pour billions into developing a new range of “greener” cars to replace petrol- and diesel-powered models over the next few years. “It seems astronomic at the moment – $650bn within 10 years. I don’t think so,” Stadler said. “The fact that you have everyone else piling into this makes it much harder. The others also already have the ability to scale it. To get to that valuation, Tesla would have to be absolutely dominant in electric vehicles.” To put it in context, only three companies had a market value of more than $650bn at the end of 2017: Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google’s parent). GM’s market capitalisation is $61.5bn and Ford is worth $41bn. Even those that have been bullish on Tesla shares express some doubts about the incentive package and stretching valuation targets. Adam Jonas, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: “We see Elon Musk’s ambitious long-term awards plan as an aspirational marketing tool to attract talent and capital ahead of an upward inflection in competition.” Tesla’s ambitious target implies the shares will rise by about 27% a year, a feat achieved by just a handful of large American companies in recent years, including Amazon, Priceline Group (the owner of Booking.com) and Domino’s Pizza. Stadler believes propelling Tesla into this gilded group of success stories could be the key motivating factor for Musk – far more than any promised riches. Musk is already the biggest shareholder in Tesla and has an estimated net worth of $20bn, according to Forbes. So it would be difficult for the board to incentivise him by dangling an even bigger carrot. “Musk is happy to have something that makes him potentially no money because he is already wealthy. The one thing that might motivate him is that the valuation target is roughly reflective of what Amazon did, so it might motivate him to want to do better than Jeff Bezos did,” Stadler said. “However, it’s a different industry [to Amazon]. Tesla is trying to be strong in a space that is already strong.” The true believers reckon those who see Tesla as just another carmaker are missing the point. At the moment, the solar energy storage part of Tesla accounts for just 1% of its business. But it has plans to “expand solar energy generation through Solar Roof and other solar products, and seamlessly integrate them with battery storage” and to “build out Tesla’s vehicle product line to cover all major forms of terrestrial transport”. Stadler added: “Musk does see Tesla as a ‘vertically integrated sustainable energy company’, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he views that as the growth part.” If Musk is right, Tesla may just confound its critics: and drive its charismatic leader to unimaginable riches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jan/16/geothermal-cooling-cycle-paths-and-jobs-what-does-it-take-to-get-six-green-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-16T02:35:57Z","webTitle":"Geothermal cooling, cycle paths and jobs: what does it take to get six green stars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/16/geothermal-cooling-cycle-paths-and-jobs-what-does-it-take-to-get-six-green-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/16/geothermal-cooling-cycle-paths-and-jobs-what-does-it-take-to-get-six-green-stars","fields":{"headline":"Geothermal cooling, cycle paths and jobs: what does it take to get six green stars?","bodyText":"With murder rates double, and robbery rates three times, the state average, the Sydney suburb of Blacktown is not an obvious choice as a world leader of sustainable living. But, in 2016, a new master-planned estate in the suburb became the first residential community in New South Wales to be awarded a top, six-star Green Star community rating by the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA). Not only that, Fairwater, developed by Frasers Property, is the largest geothermal community in the southern hemisphere. Houses are cooled or heated by a refrigerant that pumps air underground then back to the surface, using less power than air-conditioning or heating and saving residents of a three-bedroom house $500 to $600 a year. “There’s this avenue of mature trees with this massive lake and lovely terrace houses – yoga by the lake, cycling paths, all these people walking,” says the GBCA chief executive, Romilly Madew. “If I said ‘Blacktown’ that’s not the image that would have come to your mind. It’s all about healthy and active living.” Green-star buildings produce, on average, 62% fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 51% less potable water and 66% less electricity than average buildings in Australia, according to GBCA’s 2013 report The Value of the Green Star. Since launching in 2003, hundreds of buildings around the country have been certified for the rating system and 120,000 people are now moving into Green Star communities. Out of 46 registered Green Star communities projects, 26 are already certified. Yet only 16 so far have attained the gold standard of six stars. So how do communities achieve the accolade? The key is looking at the project holistically, says Madew. “It’s about going back to that old adage of community: people, walkability, liveability, places for the kids to play. [We want to] change the way people think about how they live.” Developers, ultimately, “are there to sell house and land packages – so they’re not going to be successful unless they’re building something people want to buy. Take ‘sustainability’ out and ask what [buyers] want. They want something close to amenities – schools, public transport, shops and parks. And a home that is cheap to run.” Jessica Stewart, sustainability manager at Ginninderry, which is located in the ACT and is the latest community to achieve a six-star rating in September last year, has seen a significant shift in sustainable thinking. “Creating a sustainable community is about creating behavioural change just as much as it’s about using the right materials, designing better roadways etc. A community is only as good as the people who live there.” Straddling the Murrumbidgee River and Ginninderra Creek, Ginninderry is leading the way in water sensitive urban design, using a network of wetlands, basins and bioretention swales to “capture, cleanse, recycle and infiltrate” water on site. Meanwhile solar panels on all houses in the community, jointly developed by the ACT government and Riverview Developments, are mandatory; a third of the site is reserved as a conservation corridor; and Spark, a social initiative project, will provide local employment opportunities (contractors on site, for example, must hire a certain number of residents from the area). Five elements are assessed to achieve a six-star rating: governance, liveability, economic prosperity, environment, and innovation. Within these, innovation, as Fairwater and Ginninderry have demonstrated, is critical. Fairwater’s geothermal technology was an industry first. But developers also made sure that it was used to create jobs, partnering with Australian companies QPS Geothermal and Actron Air to design, manufacture and install components using largely local labour. Fairwater is not alone. Last year Lendlease and LandCorp’s Alkimos, a 710-hectare master-planned community in Perth, which is due to deliver 2,000 homes for 6,000 residents, became the first in the country to receive a six-star rating. Crucial is a $6.9m residential battery storage trial, in which more than 100 homes will be connected to a 1.1MWh solar energy storage system, lowering demand from the grid. Open space is measured, as is access to public transport and employment opportunities. Alkimos, when completed, will have 3.6ha of playing fields, 6ha of conservation reserves and 41ha of foreshore reserves. Each home will be located within 800m of transport links and 200m from a park. Compulsory solar panels, meanwhile, are expected to reduce energy bills by up to 50%. Despite this, “community initiatives are just as important as the physical ones”, says Lendlease’s managing director of communities, Matthew Wallace. One example is the Sprout Hub, a social enterprise café-cum-co-working space, designed to encourage new local businesses. In Fairwater, meanwhile, residents can use the free Live Life Get Active fitness camp (offering classes and nutrition plans), as well as the multitude of cycling paths and walking trails. Developers see such community enterprises as a point of difference that will attract buyers. “More people are taking a greater interest in living a sustainable lifestyle,” says Paolo Bevilacqua, the general manager of sustainability at Frasers Property Australia. “So there are marketing advantages.” There are challenges, however, too – not least due to the sheer size and vast time scales of these communities. Ginninderry, for one, plans to deliver 11,500 new homes by 2055. “What will car use look like in 40 years?” asks Stewart. “What do people do as work, how do they live, how do they interact together? All those things can change.” In order to avoid complacency – and to make sure that promises are delivered – projects must re-certify every five years. Most important in achieving a six-star rating is starting the process in the planning phase, ensuring that everyone from stakeholders to construction firms know what is required. As Bevilacqua says, “It cannot be an afterthought.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/01/solar-panel-home-installation-energy-environment-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-01T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"How to install solar panels at home – to save the Earth and your bank account","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/01/solar-panel-home-installation-energy-environment-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/01/solar-panel-home-installation-energy-environment-explainer","fields":{"headline":"How to install solar panels at home – to save the Earth and your bank account","bodyText":"Installing solar panels on the roof of your home is a big project – but it can pay dividends in more ways than one. There’s the obvious environmental benefit, but for many homeowners, the joy comes with a dollar sign attached. Turning your home into a mini power plant can save you good money on the electric bill. Here is a guide to get you started. An average, 5-kilowatt system will cost about $15,000 to $20,000, depending on where you live in the US. So it pays to find out if your state or utility offers rebates or other incentives to help lower the cost of going solar. Here is a sure bet: the federal government offers a 30% tax credit (though it’s set to decline starting in 2020). You can start your research with this federally funded, comprehensive database that lists all sorts of incentives and policies for renewable energy by state. If that seems daunting, then begin your homework by contacting the state agency that regulates utilities. Some states with strong policies to promote solar energy use, such as California, New York and Massachusetts, have created their own websites listing incentives, financing options and tips for hiring a contractor to install the solar panels. Your utility might offer a similar helpful guide. As with any major home improvement project, finding a good contractor is crucial. A trustworthy installer will secure the necessary permits, properly connect the solar energy system to your home and the local electric grid, and apply for incentives for you. Some states – or local utilities – post a list of certified solar service companies. Many consumers ask friends and neighbors for recommendations. Googling works just as well. Regardless of the approach, you should always get several quotes and chat with the installers to find a good match. Another big decision is how to pay for the equipment and services. You can pay for them outright, of course. A solar energy system lasts about 20 years, so paying for it upfront will be a cheaper option over time than to lease it. As an owner, you get a bonus incentive if you live in a state that allows you to sell excess solar electricity to your utility. The money you earn will show up as a credit on your bill. Another popular option is to leave the ownership and maintenance of the solar panels to your installer (and its investors) and pay only for the electricity produced from the rooftop system. This arrangement is done through what’s commonly called a power purchase agreement, which can last 15 years or more. Your solar company typically sweetens the deal by charging you a lower electric rate than your utility would. Be sure to read the contract to see how your installer sets the electric rates over time. Those rates are likely to change. The solar energy market is growing because the average price for solar energy systems has fallen so much – 54% between 2010 and 2016, according to GTM Research. While your solar panels may not produce all the electricity you need, they are becoming a good investment to lower your bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/08/aviva-under-fire-for-pouring-370m-into-polish-coal-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T06:01:23Z","webTitle":"Aviva under fire for pouring £370m into Polish coal industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/aviva-under-fire-for-pouring-370m-into-polish-coal-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/08/aviva-under-fire-for-pouring-370m-into-polish-coal-industry","fields":{"headline":"Aviva under fire for pouring £370m into Polish coal industry","bodyText":"UK insurer Aviva is the second-biggest investor in the Polish coal industry, the most polluting in Europe, according to a report that looks at insurance firms’ involvement in the sector. Aviva is among a number of major European insurers that are backing the expansion of Poland’s coal industry, undermining international efforts to battle climate change, according to research from Unfriend Coal, a global network of organisations including Greenpeace Switzerland, 350.org and the UK Tar Sands Network. Aviva has invested £372.7m in Polish coal, more than any other insurance company apart from the Dutch firm Nationale Nederlanden, the report found. Poland’s coal industry is the second biggest in Europe, after Germany. Pollution from Polish coal is estimated to cause 5,830 premature deaths across Europe every year, Unfriend Coal said. The UN recently called for a stop to new coal power plants and an accelerated phase-out of existing ones. But Polish companies are planning to build power plants able to generate more than 10 gigawatts and open new mines holding more than 3.2bn tonnes of lignite, the dirtiest form of coal. Aviva’s investments are held through its Polish pension fund, OFE Aviva BZ WBK. The fund increased its holdings in Polish coal companies by more than £45m between 2016 and 2017. It has a 2.3% stake in the country’s largest power company PGE, which operates two of Europe’s most polluting coal plants at Bełchatów and Turów and plans to build new coal plants generating more than 5.2GW. Peter Bosshard, Unfriend Coal coordinator, said: “Unlike all other insurers which are taking action on coal, Aviva decided to focus on engagement rather than on divestment, and have only divested from very few companies if engagement was completely unproductive.” Aviva said it invested more than £525m in low-carbon projects such as renewable windfarms and solar energy last year. It added that it engaged with companies that derive more than 30% of revenue from coal to improve their business practices and will divest “where we do not see sufficient movement to transition away from coal”. “In Poland, local pension companies, including Aviva, manage customers’ assets under a strict regulatory regime and are not able to influence the investment strategy for these. The investment guidelines focus on domestic equity where the energy industry is the second largest after the banking sector,” it said. European insurers have invested more than £1.15bn in Polish coal companies and have signed at least 21 contracts insuring coal plants since 2013, according to Unfriend Coal. Europe’s biggest insurer, Allianz, is leading a consortium underwriting the biggest coal power plant under construction in Europe at Opole near Katowice, a PGE project, which is due to start operating next year. The consortium includes Italy’s Generali, Germany’s Munich Re and the Polish insurer PZU. Allianz said: “We will continue to insure utilities and mining companies when they show an adequate sustainability performance or suitable risk mitigation strategies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/22/renewables-roadshow-how-the-nonna-effect-changed-darebins-approach-to-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T01:31:17Z","webTitle":"Renewables roadshow: how the 'nonna effect' got Darebin's pensioners signing up to solar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/22/renewables-roadshow-how-the-nonna-effect-changed-darebins-approach-to-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/22/renewables-roadshow-how-the-nonna-effect-changed-darebins-approach-to-solar","fields":{"headline":"Renewables roadshow: how the 'nonna effect' got Darebin's pensioners signing up to solar","bodyText":"In Darebin in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, solar installations have spread rapidly through the area’s low-income households. “We call it the ‘nonna effect’,” says Trent McCarthy, a Greens councillor in Darebin. “The nonna in the street has her solar on her roof. She’s very proud, she tells all of her friends. It’s social marketing 101.” It has spread throughout that area because the council has rolled out a program that allows local pensioners to install solar at no upfront cost and immediately start saving money, while the council recovers the full amount without interest over 10 years. While electricity bills can be a serious cause of stress for low-income households, and solar can help to reduce electricity bills, it is those very low income households that often struggle the most to find the initial outlay to cover the cost of a solar installation. As a result, those that can benefit most are often excluded. That observation was backed up by a survey run by the Darebin city council, says Gavin Mountjoy, the council’s environmental strategy coordinator. “We surveyed a lot of pensioners – about 4,000 pensioners – to see what were their main concerns,” Mountjoy says. Among the results, rising electricity prices jumped out as a major concern. But the survey also revealed pensioners didn’t know who to trust to get solar panels installed and they didn’t have the money to pay for the installation. So the council introduced the Solar Saver program. “The Solar Saver program started as a result of a council initiative to try to explore ways to help pensioners and low-income households deal with rising electricity prices,” Mountjoy says. The basic idea of the program is simple: the council would pay for the panels to be installed and get the money back over 10 years through a small additional charge to the home owner’s land rates. The first round of the program was open to low-income households who were receiving government income support. Colin Sutton lives in a quiet street in Preston, part of the Darebin local government area. He lives at home and cares for his adult son who has autistic spectrum disorder. He was one of the first locals to take part in the program. “I sell about $100 worth of power back to my power company every year, perhaps a little bit more,” he says. “And I estimate that I’m saving about $400 in actual power.” He pays $300 a year back to the council through his rates and estimates he is about $200 ahead already. After 10 years, the panels will be paid off and, assuming they’re still working, he will then be $500 ahead each year. The second round of the Solar Savers program sought to address another barrier to solar ownership: renting. For most landlords, it doesn’t make sense to install solar on a house you own – the tenants pay for electricity so the landlord takes the cost while the tenants make all the savings. So Darebin city council partnered with low-income housing cooperatives and organised a similar deal. Jen Jewel Brown lives in the Northcote Rental Housing Cooperative, which works with low-income renters. The homes are principally state government owned, but are managed and maintain by the co-op and are self-funded. That meant the Solar Savers scheme could recoup the cost of the solar panels through the co-op, which then recouped the cost by adding a small rise to the rent of the residents that received solar. Brown says the savings in the electricity bills immediately make up for the rent increase. And she says the program will help the cooperative itself expand. “Once we’ve actually paid off the panels on the roofs, then that will be a net gain to the co-op that will allow us to do more environmentally friendly things, or house more people – or both hopefully.” As the council survey revealed, one of the key reasons that prevent people from getting solar installed is the complexity of the market, namely what system to get and who to trust to advise them. Positive Charge is a non-profit company in Melbourne that supplies exactly that sort of advice. “We help residents, businesses, schools and community organisations find ways to save energy, reduce their greenhouse impact and also improve the comfort of their buildings,” says Kate Nicolazzo, the manager of Positive Charge. “Positive Charge was, I guess, the trusted adviser. We were in a position where we could make sure people were getting the right advice around the sort of size system they should be putting on their house and that any of the considerations were being taken into account to make sure people weren’t being taken advantage of and that council could actually support their installation of solar.” Nicolazzo says the Solar Savers program broke down the age barriers to becoming a solar owner. “For this project, we had a man in his 80s come along to one of the information sessions and we thought he was the person who was going to be putting solar on their roof,” Nicolazzo recalls. “And he said no, that’s actually for my father. So, with the Solar Savers program, one of our great stories was a 102-year-old man putting solar on his roof because he understood that the benefits lasted way beyond his lifespan.” McCarthy says the program was a first in Australia but is now being explored all around the country. “Solar Savers has been a little bit of a quiet rooftop revolution.” But McCarthy says state and federal governments could help to speed up the uptake of solar around the country, as well as make programs like Solar Saver more effective. “We’d love to see this program scaled up but we know that one of the biggest barriers is actually the feed-in tariff,” he says. “We’d like to see a fair price for solar, which means the power that people are generating on their roof, which is a renewable energy. They’re getting a fair price compared to what they would be paying for fossil fuel energy from a power company.” But, regardless, he says the program has been a success for everyone involved. “This is one of those programs that is a win-win-win,” McCarthy says. The environment and the residents win, while the council makes back most of its money and also gets closer to its zero-greenhouse gas target. “But, importantly, it makes a bit of a community change because it shows that, at the grassroots level, we can make a difference by aggregating the community [and] by bringing people together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-24T08:38:07Z","webTitle":"James Bond on film – 007's best and worst movies ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/aug/24/james-bond-on-film-ranked","fields":{"headline":"James Bond on film – 007's best and worst movies ranked!","bodyText":"26. Casino Royale (1967) Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Even a cameo from Orson Welles couldn’t lend lustre to this pointless and unfunny spoof, a dire tongue-in-cheeker that slipped past the franchise control of the producers, Eon. David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film. 25. Die Another Day (2002) Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new “war on terror”-era, and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of 007: an invisible car. What on earth is the point of that? You can almost see the P45 being pressed into Brosnan’s hand. 24. The Living Daylights (1987) This was the turn of straight actor and RSC stalwart Timothy Dalton. He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always just looked a bit humourless. This was during the Aids era of sexual restraint, too, so Bond only cops off a couple of times. 23. Licence to Kill (1989) Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit. 22. For Your Eyes Only (1981) You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Roger Moore begins to tune out. The stunts hold up, but Moore is on the exit ramp and his flaccid relationship with 24-year-old Carole Bouquet is a deathly embarrassment. 21. Never Say Never Again (1983) The title is what Connery’s agent should have shouted at him when he was offered the comeback: (“Never”! Say “Never”! Again!) Connery lumbers back for the remake of Thunderball that no one wanted or needed. He was never a six-pack guy at the best of times, but he’s out of condition here. One to forget. 20. Quantum of Solace (2008) Much mocked at the time, this film wasn’t as bad as that – despite the silliest title in the series’ history. Craig is always watchable and Mathieu Amalric is a very eccentric oddball villain. 19. The World Is Not Enough (1999) Not bad, but some of the fizz has gone. In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days. 18. GoldenEye (1995) Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back! 17. A View to a Kill (1985) Quite unexpectedly, Moore pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell’s Miss Moneypenny.) Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Moore to bow out on. 16. Moonraker (1979) A whopping, megabudget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led sci-fi revival. It is all about the theft of a space shuttle, but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Moore is looking a bit jaded. 15. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969) George Lazenby’s sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have become a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows 007 is no commitmentphobe. They marry, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond’s eternal singledom. 14. Diamonds Are Forever (1971) Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupeed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as the villain. 13. Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) It took a spanking from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in 90s media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul. 12. Octopussy (1983) Outrageously daft, but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume. 11. The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an obvious back projection. 10. The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) Despite iffy reviews at the time, this has one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It is a preposterous 70s fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There’s some funky martial arts, too. 9. Skyfall (2012) An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench’s M, developed her relationship with 007 and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role. 8. Live and Let Die (1973) And so began the reign of Roger Moore, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature 46 when he took over (Connery had started at 32.) This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings. 7. Thunderball (1965) The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming’s Thunderball novel, but we were used to it by now, this being the fourth outing for 007 on the big screen. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences. 6. Spectre (2015) Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming 007 extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the show as the geeky Q. 5. Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now. One of the best Bonds. 4. Dr No (1962) Sean Connery’s first outing in the Bond role. It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair. 3. From Russia With Love (1963) Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like 10 minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. There’s a great train fight with Robert Shaw’s Red Grant. 2. Goldfinger (1964) “You eckshpect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 and the weird spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves 007 time to escape some elaborate automated death. 1. You Only Live Twice (1967) This great action movie put Connery’s Bond right back on top and introduced us to the Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. Perhaps he knew it could never be this good again?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/17/people-power-tasmanian-residents-to-store-solar-energy-and-sell-it-back-to-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-16T23:49:30Z","webTitle":"People power: Tasmanian residents to store solar energy and sell it back to grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/17/people-power-tasmanian-residents-to-store-solar-energy-and-sell-it-back-to-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/17/people-power-tasmanian-residents-to-store-solar-energy-and-sell-it-back-to-grid","fields":{"headline":"People power: Tasmanian residents to store solar energy and sell it back to grid","bodyText":"There are more than 1.5m households in Australia with rooftop solar. And in a few months time, 40 Tasmanian homeswill be acting as mini power stations – not just producing energy for their own consumption and to export back into the grid, but actively trading and profiting from the power they generate. Much has been written about rooftop solar and the impending boom in battery storage but the key ingredient to turning homes into mini-power stations is the software that links the hardware of these technologies. Now the Canberra-based startup Reposit Power is helping to change the way households and energy companies think about solar and storage. The trial that is to start in Bruny Island, south of Hobart, will see the households equipped with rooftop solar, battery storage, and Reposit’s GridCredits software. There are numerous reasons why Bruny Island is an attractive place for the trial. Firstly it relies on a cable link to the mainland for the bulk of its power, and the trial will provide solid information to TasNetworks about how self-sufficient the island can become. The second reason is that Bruny experiences huge spikes of demand during the holiday season, and the use of battery storage can possibly help to reduce those big demand peaks, and therefore the size of the cable that serves the island. The greater the demand, the bigger the connection needed. And lastly it is attractive to the households. The GridCredits software automates trading with the network. Instead of getting the base 5.6c/kWh for exports back into the grid of surplus solar power, households can store the energy until the grid really needs it, and then might be able to receive up to $1/kWh for those exports. That effectively turns them into mini-power stations, although the software is doing all the heavy lifting. A Reposit Power co-founder, Dean Spaccavento, says it is yet another step towards Australia’slong-term goal of switching off from fossil fuels, as well as delivering on predictions that one half of all demand will be sourced from homes, businesses and communities. “The end game is to turn off coal,” Spaccavento says. “The nice way to say it is to improve the operation of the electricity system, both in how it is run, and how solar and other renewables are injected into the grid. “So the idea is to manage the system, keep prices low, ensure everyone has power when they need it, and allow greater penetration of renewables. Reposit Power’s software is the glue that keeps the system together and ensures that customers are being paid properly for the electricity that the system is using.” The trial also involves the University of Sydney, the University of Tasmania and the Australian National University. They will use the trial to research the ideal sizing of solar and storage systems, how much households should be paid, and through what mechanism. The research is important because it is now acceptedthat about half of all electricity demand will one day come from rooftop solar and battery storage from households and businesses, or near the point of consumption. This is known as distributed energy, a different system to the centralised system that has ruled the grid for a century or more. Configuring how this works is crucial, given the complexity of the electricity system. It is not just a matter of setting tariffs, but also recognising the value of various technologies. This has been at the heart of the discussion about the new feed-in-tariffs for rooftop solar, which have been slashed to little more than the average wholesale price of electricity, despite the benefits it brings in reducing and narrowing peaks, avoiding system upgrades, and cutting the amount of fossil fuels burned. Spaccavento says through the Reposit Power systems, consumers get paid for the use of the battery storage at specific times. “The Reposit box is your personal trading desk,” he says. “It operates on your behalf but will take instructions from the local utility – in this case TasNetworks.” It is fast, he says, and can both produce and consume power in an instant. “It’s just the type of power station that the future needs. We think it’s very important that homes across Australia be able to participate in electricity markets.” The software is designed to integrate with the wholesale market, and the newly expanding markets of network support and ancilliary services, which will help to keep the grid stable. And by doing this, Spaccavento says the technology addresses the frustration that households experience by getting paid so little for their solar exports. He argues that households should stay with the grid. “We actively discourage people from leaving the grid. But if you want to clean it up, the right thing to do is to offer a system at the right rates. “When people feel disempowered, they will make radical decisions. We are finding a way to empower them, rather than encouraging them to withdraw.” The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is contributing $2.9m towards the project, but the Arena chief executive, Ivor Frischknecht, is looking beyond just solar and storage. “Because Bruny Island has a very high penetration of renewables and a very good wind resource; [the question] is how can you actually use renewables and storage in combination ...to supply secure energy to the people there? “They have a particular problem, in that lots of holidaymakers go there, so there are times of the year when they have lots of demand. And if they have lots of demand and there’s no sun or wind at that moment, what do they do? And so it’s about designing a whole network that way.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/2018/oct/21/frances-arnold-interview-ability-engineer-most-complicated-things-on-planet-nobel-prize-enzymes-chem","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-21T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Frances Arnold: ‘To expect a Nobel prize is rather silly’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/21/frances-arnold-interview-ability-engineer-most-complicated-things-on-planet-nobel-prize-enzymes-chem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/oct/21/frances-arnold-interview-ability-engineer-most-complicated-things-on-planet-nobel-prize-enzymes-chem","fields":{"headline":"Frances Arnold: ‘To expect a Nobel prize is rather silly’","bodyText":"This month, Frances Arnold, professor of chemical engineering at Caltech in California, was awarded the 2018 Nobel prize in chemistry, shared with two others. She’s the fifth female chemistry laureate since the prizes first began in 1901, and the only ever American woman to win in the subject. Where were you when you got the news you had won the Nobel prize? I was in deep sleep in a Dallas hotel room having arrived at midnight to give a lecture the next day. The phone rang at 4am. I was worried that it was some emergency at home. Then I saw that the telephone number was from Europe and I thought maybe I had better answer it. Though I had been given hints in the past, I certainly didn’t expect it. There are many wonderful chemists whose work deserves the Nobel prize and to expect one is rather silly. Were you always interested in engineering? I was always making things, mostly art projects, but I was also very good at and loved maths – especially geometry – and puzzles. And I was always interested in technology. My father was a nuclear physicist who revelled in the scholastic achievements of his children. I had four brothers who I loved to compete with and we were all equally encouraged. I took mechanical drawing, geometry and typing at high school, the latter because that is what they did with smart girls in those days! What turned you on to biotechnology? I studied mechanical engineering at Princeton and worked on solar energy after graduation. But the industry’s prospects changed for the worse in the early 1980s and I decided to do my PhD in chemical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I had initially intended to work on biofuels but I stumbled on this new field of biotechnology. The ability to engineer the most complicated things on our planet – biological systems – was too much of a draw to ignore. Your Nobel prize was awarded for the “directed evolution of enzymes”. What’s that? It is basically breeding, similar to mating cats or dogs to bring out desired traits, but at the level of molecules. The aim is to create new and better biological material in the form of enzymes, which are proteins that catalyse chemical reactions. And this allows us to use greener biological manufacturing processes to make the fuels, chemicals and materials we use in our daily lives. It starts with a gene, a stretch of DNA that encodes for the particular enzyme to be enhanced. In a test tube under error-prone conditions, the DNA is copied so a small number of random mutations are introduced. The hard chemistry is then actually done by bacteria – which read DNA and make beautiful proteins according to a DNA code. Those millions of genes each with a few errors in them are inserted into the bacteria, which make the enzymes with a few errors in them. The enzymes are then tested to see which are better than the original, for example more active in a particular environment. Their genes are then taken and the cycle repeated to acquire new traits. It is evolution guided and sped up by artificial selection. Your seminal paper which first demonstrated that this method worked was published in 1993. You started with the enzyme subtilisin, which breaks down milk protein, and used directed evolution to produce a version of it that worked not in a water-based solution but in an organic solvent. Did you have a kind of “aha” moment when you suddenly realised it worked? The thinking [prior to this paper] was very different. People thought you should design new enzymes using logic and knowledge of how proteins function – but that approach hadn’t yielded successful results. We showed you didn’t have to do it that way: you could do it by using directed evolution instead. The 1993 paper was the culmination of about three years of work which started in the late 1980s, soon after I joined Caltech. It was an “aha” set of months when we saw we could breed surprising new traits. We had wondered: would beneficial mutations be common enough? Could we measure them? Could we create anything in a short enough timescale that would allow me to get a tenure at Caltech? The ‘“aha” realisation meant the answer was yes! Enzymes developed by your method are used today to make everything from laundry detergents to biofuels and medicines. What applications are you most proud of? I never patented the basic technology, which was a good thing, because it meant use spread to other labs. One of the most compelling applications has been by the drug maker Merck &amp; Co, which developed an enzyme through directed evolution to make the drug Januvia, used to treat diabetes. That was formerly made using toxic metals, with a lot of waste products. Have you worked on any applications? I have worked on enzymes to make better biofuels, co-founding a company, Gevo, to do this in 2005. More recently, I have started a company, Provivi, with two of my former students to make nontoxic alternatives to pesticides that draw on the method. What are you working on in your lab at the moment? Evolution is good for optimising and that is well understood. But evolution also creates things that no one knew were even possible. In the test tube, I can make any DNA I want, recombining it from monkeys, worms, anywhere. So I can explore new rules of breeding with molecules. We’ve recently evolved enzymes that make chemical bonds not found in nature. For example, in 2016, we published the first enzyme to forge carbon-silicon bonds. Products ranging from paint to personal care items contain carbon-silicon bonds, all made using precious metal catalysts like platinum. This work opens up the possibility that biology could make them more cheaply and cleanly. Some people find it remarkable that there are two female winners this year of Nobel prizes because it is usually all men (Donna Strickland became the third woman ever to win a Nobel prize in physics). Are you supportive of the Nobel committees having written to nominators for 2019 to ask them to be more inclusive to make sure they don’t leave women or ethnic minorities out? It is remarkable – and wonderful. But also not surprising because there are women doing fabulous physics and chemistry. I predict this is the beginning of a steady stream. To ask nominators to think about this is a really good thing because it is when you think about it that you realise how many brilliant women there are. To get the prize, you first have to be nominated. That means someone has to care enough about you to take the time to explain your science to someone else. Men often have a good network of people who are willing to do that for them. Women need to cultivate those networks and often they are not as pushy about that as some of the men are. We have to learn how to be pushy or at least ask and I am gratified to see that my younger colleagues are starting to do that. Sexual harassment is rife in the sciences according to a report published this June by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Have you experienced it in your working life? Do we need female scientists to speak out about their experiences? In so far as stupid sexist remarks and behaviour, yes, but I am gifted with the ability to ignore those people and that has served me well. However, I certainly understand that many women are more sensitive than I am. I think that women should talk about their experiences to the extent it helps them come to terms with what they have experienced. And people need to listen and understand that these experiences can have a dramatic, negative effect on one’s career. You’ve been dealt some challenging and tragic events in your personal life – you’ve lost two husbands (your first to cancer, your second by suicide), one of your three sons was killed in an accident and you underwent treatment for breast cancer. Does your work provide certainty – some respite from the randomness and misfortunes of life? I certainly find respite at my institution, Caltech, where I have been for 30 years and have a wonderful group of close friends. I also find grounding in working with students. I have a steady stream of brilliant young people coming through my laboratory whose curiosity and love of science are tremendous positive forces. I have also learned how to be grateful for what I have rather than sorry for what I don’t. That helps me look at the good side of things. Where do you get your ideas? I had one good idea back in the 1980s and have been working on that ever since! I see my job as helping to promote the ideas of my students. They are looking at biology with this whole new set of eyes and their brains are full of possibilities. I am a very good editor of ideas and if I can help them hone those, that is immensely satisfying. What words of advice would you give young women who want a career in science or engineering? Don’t leave this wonderful, fun work just for the men."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/nov/15/climate-change-democrats-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-15T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Big Oil v the planet is the fight of our lives.

Democrats must choose a side","bodyText":"The world’s leading scientists issued a report warning of total planetary dystopia unless we take immediate steps to seriously reduce carbon emissions. Then, oil and gas corporations dumped millions of dollars into the 2018 elections to defeat the major initiatives that could have slightly reduced fossil fuel use. Though you may not know it from the cable TV coverage, this was one of the most significant – and the most terrifying – stories of the midterms. For those who actually care about the survival of the human race, the key questions now should be obvious: is there any reason to hope that we will retreat from “drill baby drill” and enact a sane set of climate policies? Or is our country – and, by extension, our species – just going to give up? Before answering, it is worth reviewing exactly what happened over these last few months, because the election illustrates how little the fossil fuel industry is willing to concede in the face of a genuine crisis. While the dominant media narrative has been about Democratic voters euphorically electing a House majority and yelling a primal scream at Donald Trump, the loudest shriek of defiance was the one bellowed by oil and gas CEOs. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that we have only 12 years to ward off an ecological disaster, those oil and gas executives’ message to Planet Earth was unequivocal: drop dead. That message was most explicit in Colorado, where a drilling and fracking boom is happening in the middle of fast-growing suburbs. With oil and gas companies seeking to put noxious derricks and rigs near population centers, local activists backed a ballot measure called Proposition 112 that aimed to make sure new fossil fuel infrastructure is set a bit farther away from schools, hospitals, residential neighborhoods and water sources. The initiative was an angry response to a state government so awash in fossil fuel campaign cash that it has blocked legislation to merely allow regulators to prioritize the health and safety of residents when those regulators issue permits for drilling and fracking. According to an industry analysis, Proposition 112 would have left much of the oil and gas reserves near Denver accessible for extraction, but yes, it is true – at a time when climate scientists say we must keep fossil fuel deposits in the ground, there was a chance the initiative would have stopped some extraction. The oil and gas industry could have looked across a Colorado ravaged by climate-intensified wildfires, droughts and floods and decided to accept the modest measure, knowing that the initiative is the absolute minimum that is required at this perilous moment. Instead, fossil fuel companies did the opposite: they poured $40m into opposing Proposition 112 and spreading insidious agitprop. Despite scientists warning that fracked natural gas threatens to worsen climate change, oil and gas operatives in the state promoted cartoonishly dishonest claims that burning fossil fuel “is cleaning our air and improving health”. As Colorado’s local media effectively erased the term “climate change” from its election coverage, the industry managed to defeat the measure by outspending its proponents 40-to-1. In the process, fossil fuel companies’ scorched-earth campaign was a clear statement that in the face of an environmental cataclysm, oil and gas moguls will not accept even a tiny reduction in their revenues. In the Pacific north-west and the south-west, it was a similar tale. In Washington State, petroleum giants funneled $25m into defeating a proposal to require polluters to pay some of the costs of the climate change havoc they are wreaking. The measure, which would have assessed a $15 fee for every ton of greenhouse gases they emit, was beaten with 56% of the vote, after the industry’s ad campaign featured criticism from a former state attorney general – who viewers weren’t told now works at Chevron’s law firm. In all, $13m of the funding against the measure came from BP – a company that simultaneously claims to unsuspecting consumers that it supports a carbon tax. In sun-baked Arizona, you may have thought solar energy would be a fairly easy pitch. However, after the owner of the state’s major energy provider poured nearly $30m into the election, Arizonans soundly rejected a ballot initiative to force the utility to get more of its power from renewable sources. Meanwhile, in a single California county, the fossil fuel industry spent a whopping $8m to defeat a citizens’ initiative to ban new drilling and fracking. Realizing that they may have overreached, some fossil fuel industry spokespeople are now telling lawmakers that oil and gas companies really do want to work collaboratively on environmental issues. However, their behavior in the election proved that the industry is not operating in good faith. Oil and gas CEOs showed that they will gladly accelerate the climate crisis if doing so allows them to rake in more money. And make no mistake about it: the industry’s roughly $100m in campaign spending this year was not just about one individual election cycle. It was a shock-and-awe spectacle designed to intimidate any prospective campaigns, organizations and movements that want to challenge the political supremacy of oil and gas – and some prominent Democrats in Washington seem to be cowering in fear. Always nervous about the donor class and about electoral blowback from Republicans, some congressional Democrats now seem intent on avoiding any direct confrontation over climate change policy. Indeed, days before the election, the Hill newspaper surveyed lawmakers and major environmental groups, and found that “Democrats are unlikely to pursue major climate change legislation if they win the House majority, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue.” As her own state was being incinerated by climate-intensified wildfires, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, faced pressure for climate action from new lawmakers like New York Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – but Pelosi would only commit to reviving a moribund congressional committee to study the issue. The conflict-averse posture follows the party recently rescinding its policy of rejecting fossil fuel campaign cash, as well as Democratic Representative Vicente Gonzalez of climate-ravaged Texas setting up a new Oil &amp; Gas Caucus to promote the “economic benefits of fully harnessing the country’s natural resources”. Taken together, these developments – coupled with the Trump administration’s opposition to any serious climate policy – have left many voters and activists feeling despondent, even in the aftermath of a “blue wave” election. As former Bernie Sanders campaign aide Claire Sandberg tweeted: “Entire towns are burning to nothing in California. People are being incinerated alive in their cars attempting to flee. But a majority of Democrats still won’t reject fossil fuel money, and no one has put forward a climate plan that is remotely commensurate with the IPCC findings.” And yet, amid the thick smoke of wildfires and industry propaganda, there is still reason to believe that our children are not guaranteed to live in a real-life version of Mad Max: Fury Road. Our fate is not – yet – sealed, as long as those who want humanity to survive pay attention to exactly what science, the fossil fuel industry and the political trends are telling us, and then act accordingly in the arenas where immediate progress is most likely. First and foremost, there are now 14 states that have the trifecta of Democratic control of the governorship and both legislative chambers. Those include major fossil fuel producing states such as Colorado, New Mexico and California. Democratic leaders in these states cannot claim that climate inaction is a product of Republican intransigence – the Democrats in these locales have uninhibited power. And so if activists work to hold these local Democratic lawmakers accountable, there is a good chance they can force legislatures to enact emissions standards, renewable energy mandates and other environmental rules that will bolster the fight against climate change. Similarly, states and cities collectively control trillions dollars of public pension money that can be marshaled for the battle. Shifting that cash out of oil and gas can at once provide more capital for renewable energy and drain fossil fuel companies of resources they need for their extraction binge. Officials like New York comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, incoming Connecticut treasurer Shawn Wooden and North Carolina treasurer Dale Folwell may be unknown compared with the average backbench senator on the Sunday chat shows, but they and their colleagues who control these massive war chests have an enormous amount of divestment power that can both support the climate change fight, and boost investment returns for retirees. There’s a good chance that at least some of them can be spurred to action if they are no longer permitted to toil in obscurity, and instead face consistent grassroots pressure. The courts are another arena where the climate fight seems to be accelerating. There, teenagers are mounting a landmark case arguing that the government’s refusal to restrict carbon emissions is endangering the next generation’s constitutional right to life, liberty and property. A federal judge also just blocked the Keystone XL pipeline, saying that the Trump administration had improperly “discarded prior factual findings related to climate change”. At the same time, state attorneys general are pursuing a lawsuit examining whether the oil industry deliberately buried science that showed the dangers of climate change. Those cases, which bring even more pressure on the industry, can be supported by concurrent hearings and subpoenas from the low-profile House science committee, which is expected to be chaired by Texas Democratic Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has called for more aggressive action on climate change. So, considering both the election setbacks and opportunities, let’s go back to those original questions: is there reason to hope or are we just going to give up? The answer is contingent on our ability to focus in an age of distraction. Will those who truly care about the survival of humanity muster the discipline to occasionally look away from the Washington DC garbage fire and focus more activism on the state and local level? Will a media that obsesses over Trump’s tweets find the will to more diligently cover a climate crisis that threatens the planet? Will our political class behold the fossil fuel industry’s sociopathy and realize that we face an existential choice between profits and ecological survival? In short, will we as a society finally start treating this emergency as an actual emergency? If the answer is yes, then there is still reason to believe we are not doomed – but we better get to work, because there’s no time to spare.

David Castillo Mejía, the executive president of the company building a dam which Cáceres campaigned against, is the ninth person arrested for the murder, and the fourth with ties to the Honduran military. Castillo Mejía is accused by arresting authorities of providing logistical support and other resources to one of the hitmen already charged. He is the first person to be charged as being the “intellectual author” of Cáceres’s murder and the attempted murder of Mexican environmentalist Gustavo Castro. Cáceres was shot in her bedroom just before midnight on 2 March 2016, a year after winning the prestigious Goldman Prize for leading a campaign against the Agua Zarca dam on the Gualcarque river considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca community. The dam was licensed to the company Desarrollos Energéticos SA (Desa) without the legally required community consultation. Cáceres had led a campaign of peaceful community resistance against the dam which triggered a wave of repression including smear campaigns, violent evictions, sexual harassment, false criminal charges, and ultimately her murder. Before her death, Cáceres had said that she was scared of Castillo Mejía because of his military intelligence background. She told close friends and family that Castillo Mejía hounded her with texts, phone calls, and in person, appearing without warning at her home, work events and even the airport. He was arrested at San Pedro Sula international aiport trying to leave the country, the public ministry confirmed in a tweet alongside a photo of Castillo Mejía in custody. The US ambassador to Honduras Heidi Fulton praised investigators for capturing Castillo Mejía in a series of tweets. Last September, Castillo Mejía used the same platform to thank the embassy for inviting him to a solar energy conference in Las Vegas. Castillo Mejía attended the event in his capacity as president of the energy company PEMSA (Desarrollador de Proyectos de Energía Eléctrica) – one of two major shareholders in Desa. A Guardian investigation into the murder found that Cáceres appeared on a military hitlist given to US-backed elite forces just months before she was murdered. The murder was carried out like a “well-planned operation designed by military intelligence”, a legal source told the Guardian last year. Desa’s board also includes a former justice minister and several members of the Atala Zablah family, part of one of the richest and most powerful clans in Honduras. The company vice-president, Jacobo Nicolás Atala Zablah, is president of the BAC Honduras bank. His cousin Camilo owns the country’s biggest bank, Banco Fichosa. In a statement Desa said neither it nor its president Castillo Mejía had anything to do with the murder. “The company rejects this decision that is the result of international pressure and smear campaigns from various NGOs towards the company,” the statement said. Other suspects charged in connection with the murder are Sergio Ramón Rodríguez Orellana, a Desa manager; Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a former infantry officer and close friend of Mariano Díaz Chávez, a special forces major who fought with coalition forces in Iraq; and former soldier Henry Javier Hernández Rodríguez, the suspected point man on the night of the murder. The accused hitmen are brothers Edilson and Emerson Duarte Meza, Elvin Heriberto Rápalo Orellana and Óscar Aroldo Torres Velásquez. News of the arrest broke while protests took place across the country to demand justice for the slain leader – who is one of at least 130 environment and land defenders murdered in Honduras since the 2009 coup. The Cáceres family has repeatedly condemned authorities for their secrecy and slow progress on the case. In a statement, the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) – the organisation co-founded by Cáceres 25 years ago and now led by her second eldest daughter Bertita Zúñiga Cáceres – said: “The arrest is thanks to the work and pressure by national and international organisations. No thanks is due to the attorney general’s office, who have tried everything possible to cover up the truth in this case … Copinh will continue to denounce the entire murderous, criminal structure behind the assassination of our sister Berta Cáceres, of which David Castillo is just one piece.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/apr/01/what-are-labour-leadership-candidates-green-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-01T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"What are Labour leadership candidates' green policies?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/01/what-are-labour-leadership-candidates-green-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/apr/01/what-are-labour-leadership-candidates-green-policies","fields":{"headline":"What are Labour leadership candidates' green policies?","bodyText":"These questions were put to the candidates before the coronavirus crisis 1. Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour’s priority for the duration of this parliament? Rebecca Long-Bailey The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy. As leader I will continue the work I’ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition. As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump’s climate crisis denial when our country hosts Cop26 this year. Lisa Nandy Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country’s economic and foreign policies. One of the first things I did on becoming Labour’s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert’s book, Field Notes From A Catastrophe. It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn’t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we’ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don’t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too. Kier Starmer Yes – and for the next parliament when we are in government. We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing. 2. As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples? RLB As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US. At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted. As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign – lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election. LN As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street. KS The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power – from councils, city mayors to devolved governments – as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030. We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives. We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs – not the unambitious targets they have set themselves. 3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to: • Retrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament? • Producing 90% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030? • Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen? RLB Yes, I commissioned the expert report, Thirty by 2030 (pdf), these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do – but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better. Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless – we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country. LN I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change. KS I fully support Labour’s Green New Deal and the proposals for a Green Transformation Fund (pdf) and a National Investment Bank (pdf). The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party. 4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised? RLB These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can’t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain. It’s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can’t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people’s homes and the quality of jobs we create. When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world’s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains. LN I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I’m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What’s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that’s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved. KS (see previous answer) 5. How will you ensure the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis? RLB For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism. For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions. Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger – as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home. Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN’s green climate fund, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south. LN It’s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe’s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain’s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused. KS The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget – and work for greater international financial assistance – to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies. 6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded? RLB I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK’s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities. Lisa Nandy I’m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now – right in the middle of a climate emergency – is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this. KS I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy. 7. Do you support HS2? RLB Yes. The government’s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK’s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures. LN The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead. KS If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north. 8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? RLB Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour’s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them. LN I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners’ air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can’t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the Committee on Climate Change in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments. KS I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don’t think that’s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I’ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests. 9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour’s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals? RLB Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about. LN Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents’ income. So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them. Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap. KS Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution. 10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? RLB I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a “public money for public goods” approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest £3.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime. LN It’s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers’ cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way. KS Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK’s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change. 11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take? RLB Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It’s been really positive how we’ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can’t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone. LN The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food. In my view this is not about telling people what to eat – it’s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful. KS After fossil fuels, the food industry – particularly the meat and dairy sector – is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That’s why I support Labour’s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency. 12. Do you support a frequent flyer tax to reduce air travel? RLB At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less – they shouldn’t be unfairly taxed. We don’t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. LN It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener. KS Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that. 13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? RLB Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons – not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air. LN It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport – and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes. KS The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians. 14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? RLB Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization’s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour’s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain. LN It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can’t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan’s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees’s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading. KS Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones. 15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? RLB Yes. I stand by Labour’s 2019 commitment to invest an additional £5.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories. Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK’s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies. Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour’s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter. LN Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We’re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences. KS As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs – but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal. 16. What direct diplomacy should Labour undertake with international partners to help make Cop26 a success? RLB The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26. LN I was proud to lead Labour’s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full. Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them. Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London’s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement. KS We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I’m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations. 17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal? RLB Labour’s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage. LN I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality. KS We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government.

Thanks for following along today. Before I leave you, here’s a summary of the main stories of the day. Queensland reported eight new cases of Covid-19, as greater Brisbane continued its snap three-day lockdown and federal authorities declared the city a hotspot under Commonwealth guidance. The NSW National leader John Barilaro and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, called for the upper house MP and former Nat Michael Johnsen to quit parliament, following reports alleging he sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in the state’s Parliament House. The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, remained in self-isolation after developing cold-like symptoms. The first day of Labor’s national conference took place over Zoom, with the opposition unveiling a new manufacturing policy, and Anthony Albanese being introduced by former leader Bill Shorten. Scott Morrison’s new ministers were sworn in by the governor-general, also over Zoom. The Victorian government rejected a controversial AGL gas import terminal at Crib Point, in a win for environmental campaigners. We’ll see you tomorrow. With the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, in self-isolation, his deputy, Nicole Manison, has been providing an update in Darwin. She says from 4.30pm NT time, the territory will declare Byron Bay a hotspot. It means anyone who is travelling to the NT from Byron Bay after 4.30pm will be required to go into mandatory supervised quarantine – at a cost of $2,500. Anyone now in the NT who was in Byron Bay after 26 March will also need to remain in self-isolation for 14 days. They must also get tested. People who have been in the Gold Coast are now in the NT who have cold-like symptoms should also self-isolate and get tested. AAP has this markets update at the close of play. Australia’s share market had a downbeat day as spikes in bond yields prompted investors to sell equities, while Brisbane’s growing coronavirus outbreak hit Easter travel plans. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed down 61.1 points, or 0.9%, to 6,738.4 on Tuesday. The All Ordinaries closed lower by 66.6 points, or 0.95%, to 6,969.8. The indices rose early but soon moved lower, then extended losses. The heavyweight sectors of materials and health lost 1.88 and 1.05% respectively. There were notable losses for the smaller sectors of utilities and energy, down 1.77 and 1.56%. Deep Data Analytics chief executive Mathan Somasundaram said losses were to be expected nearing the end of the financial quarter, as fund managers tried to lock in profits. He also noted rises in US and Australian bond yields, which he said was part of the reflation trade. The Australian 10-year bond yield was 1.7%. Investors expect governments’ reflationary policies, which stimulate the economy by increasing money supply, to eventually lead to inflation. This has been particularly the case in the US, where investors expect strong economic recovery from the pandemic. Investors have already demanded better returns in the bond market. “If yields are higher, bonds become more attractive, which has the opposite effect on equities and other asset classes,” Somasundaram said. Domestically, Queensland tourism operators’ Easter trade has been hit by the unfolding virus outbreak. Authorities reported another eight infections have emerged, totalling 15 since the initial case last week. People in Brisbane are in their first full day of a three-day lockdown. IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said while it was tempting to believe ASX losses may have been tied to the outbreak, higher yields were the cause. The Queensland doctors’ union has called for a full investigation into how a doctor and nurse at the same Brisbane hospital contracted coronavirus, leading to two separate clusters of community transmission and a city-wide lockdown. Ben Smee has the story. NSW Health has provided updated advice for venues visited by previously confirmed Queensland cases of Covid-19 who visited the Byron Bay area. The following are close contact venues. Anyone who attended the following venues at the times listed must immediately get tested and self-isolate for 14 days from the date they were at the venue, regardless of the result: Byron Bay: Beach Hotel, 1 Bay Street, Friday, 26 March, 7.15pm-9pm Ewingsdale: Three Blue Ducks restaurant – Terrace, 11 Ewingsdale Road, Sunday, 28 March, 8.45am-9.30am The following is a casual contact venue. If you have been to this location at the listed time, you should get tested immediately and isolate until a negative result is received. Continue to monitor for symptoms, and if they appear, get tested again: Ewingsdale: The Farm – any other area not listed above (including Poppy and Fern, Wormticklers and other sections of Three Blue Ducks) 11 Ewingsdale Road, Sunday, 28 March, 8.30am-10.30am NSW Health says: The fourteen people still in NSW have been directed by NSW Health to undergo a Covid-19 test and to self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of the result. These people will receive regular follow-up contact from NSW Health during this time. Liberal senator Amanda Stoker, who was among the Coalition women handed additional responsibilities in the recent Morrison government reshuffle, says she is not seeking to run in Andrew Laming’s seat at the next election. Some of Western Australia’s most vulnerable people are flocking to receive their coronavirus jabs as the rollout begins in remote Aboriginal communities, reports AAP. About 200 people were expected to be vaccinated on Tuesday in Beagle Bay, on the Dampier Peninsula in the state’s north. It is the first remote community in WA to receive the vaccines, which are being administered by Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services. Medical director Lorraine Anderson says the successful start bodes well for keeping the virus out of vulnerable communities. “We’ve been blown away today by the enthusiasm of the community coming to be vaccinated, and especially the older people,” she told AAP. “There’s queues of people here wanting to get the vaccine. We’re really excited that people are accepting this vaccine as well as what they are today.” Tourists and travellers remain barred from entering more than 200 remote Aboriginal communities across WA as part of the state’s Covid-19 response. But the vaccination program remains a major safeguard for when access is eventually restored. “I think it’s fairly well-known that people in remote Aboriginal communities have a much higher rate of chronic disease, in particular diabetes and heart disease,” Anderson said. A thousand doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered to Broome on Friday. KAMS reaches just over half the Aboriginal population in the Kimberley, and it’s aiming to vaccinate 90% of people in the remote communities it looks after. Health workers spent about eight weeks visiting remote communities to discuss the vaccine and address any concerns. The KAMS graphics team also went to work on translating the health department messaging to make it more accessible. Liberal MP Jason Falinski is on the ABC with Labor’s Peter Khalil, who has criticised the speed of the vaccine roll out. Falinksi says: I mean, you can say a lot about this federal government but to suggest that the vaccine rollout has not been well planned and well executed by the federal government is, I think, a total miscarriage of the facts that are in front of us. Khalil replies: This is your responsibility. The one thing that Morrison has actually claimed that they have full responsibility for can’t handball it off, fob it off, throw it to the states, it is your responsibility. You promised four million by the end of March and you have failed? OK? When will phase 1a be completed? Kelly says: On the phases, we are looking to complete the 1a in the coming weeks, and then by the middle of the year 1b will be completed. On reports AstraZeneca has been suspended for people under 55, Kelly says Australian authorities are “aware of it” and “looking at it closely”. But for the moment we are pushing ahead with that same AstraZeneca rollout, and that is our workhorse at the moment in our state and territory clinics. And that’s the end of the press conference. Should states have a unified response to outbreaks, and with the vaccine program rolling out, when will states chose to “stop closing their borders in response to outbreaks”? Kelly says: Firstly, as we have said all the way through the pandemic, the public health responses are a responsibility of the states and territories, they need to do what they see fit to protect the populations of their own states and territories. I would beg to differ about states and territories taking different responses. I am actually very much, I very much welcome what has been pretty much the same response all the way through in relation to the events in Brisbane over the last few days. Western Australia has gone a bit further than the others, and particularly in their geographic understanding of the hotspot being the whole of Queensland, but most of the rest of the states have been, have taken a similar approach to grated Brisbane. On the second question, he says there have been “very frank and productive conversations over the last couple of weeks in relation to how the vaccine rollout will assist us and modify responses to these sorts of outbreaks”. We are in a situation where we are as a higher risk as we have been since the beginning of the pandemic. We know as we mostly open and there are very few restrictions on our movement, on the things we can do as a society, that means that the outbreaks can spread quickly, and so that’s why that very strong public health response is absolutely crucial at the moment, and the more vaccine that gets out there, the more people that are protected, that will decrease the outbreaks in the spread over the coming months. Asked about reports of vaccine wastage, Kelly says “cold chain logistics is a challenge for any vaccination program” and says he’s aware of a “small number” instances but does not have figures on hand. First question to Kelly. Why is the vaccine rollout so slow? He says: We have a fantastic partnership with the states and territories and that is working very well and has done from the beginning, and I’m not going to call out any particular state or territory in this regard. We are working very closely together on this massive logistic exercise. I will make one point though, and I recognise that this has been said differently in other press conferences today, but from the beginning, we have been very clear from the commonwealth how much vaccine is coming in and how much is being distributed to the places where the vaccine can be given, including each state and territory. We have been very clear in relation to the Pfizer vaccine, because the second dose needs to be given is three weeks after the first, the commonwealth, as part of our responsibility. will be keeping a second dose available for every single person that gets a first dose. There is no need for a state or territory to be keeping any vaccine aside for that purpose, that is the commonwealth’s responsibility. Kelly says authorities “will be watching very carefully what happens in Brisbane over the coming days and indeed in northern New South Wales”, because there were confirmed cases that also visited that area. Kelly says: Two clusters have been identified in the community in Queensland. There has been eight cases in the second cluster and they are both related to the B1 17 variant, the so-called UK strain which we know isa variant of concern and is more transmissible in the community. We also know that they are likely to be two quite separate incursions of this into the Brisbane community and so at this stage they are not connected outbreaks. Numerous locations have been visited by cases during their infectious period including locations in Gladstone, Moreton Bay regional city council, Byron Bay and Toowoomba. Due to this increased risk posed by the B1 17 variant and the variance of cases that have been in the community while infectious over a number of days and other factors indicating the risk of transmission, this is proportionate to the change in circumstances and the commonwealth has offered therefore the Queensland government support and assistance as is the case with a hotspot declaration. The chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly has stepped up. He says that he is declaring greater Brisbane area a Covid-19 hotspot for the purposes of commonwealth support. This is quite a statistic. We are expecting an update from the chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, shortly. Today’s development that the Victorian government has blocked AGL’s gas terminal at Crib Point is not the only news coming out of the energy company today. As AAP reports, AGL today confirmed it wants to split its business in two as it comes under increasing pressure to move to clean energy. AGL, which has traded for more than 180 years, on Tuesday unveiled plans for a “New AGL” business focused on low carbon-emitting technologies offering consumers electricity, gas, internet and mobile services. The other business – dubbed PrimeCo – would continue operating its coal-fired power stations to generate electricity. AGL has the coal-fired Bayswater and Liddell power stations in NSW, and Loy Yang stations in Victoria. The gas-fired power station on Torrens Island, South Australia, has also been controversial for its environmental impact. There are plans to build grid-scale batteries at each site, which will provide clean energy. PrimeCo would mostly serve wholesale and industrial customers, and be less consumer-focused. The chief executive Brett Redman said concerns about climate change, shifts in government policy and cheaper technology had changed the electricity market. He said structural separation would give each business the freedom to execute its own strategies. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility’s Dan Gocher was sceptical of the proposal. He said any responsible investor would surely avoid PrimeCo, due to its coal-fired power stations. “The demerger does nothing to reduce emissions, but it may appease some institutional investors who have been demanding AGL do something to reduce its carbon exposure,” he said. The splitting of the business will need shareholders and regulators to approve. The Greens are blaming the Queensland lockdown on the slow vaccine rollout and, therefore, also blaming the Morrison government. In a statement, the party’s Senate leader Larissa Waters said: The people of Brisbane and Queensland can thank the Morrison government for this lockdown. The PM promised us that four million Australians would be vaccinated by early April. But with two days until April less than 15% of that number – 550,000 people – have received a dose. In Queensland that number is only 65,000. The PM must explain why there are still unvaccinated frontline healthcare workers treating Covid patients in Queensland hospitals. Not only has this government failed the people of Queensland and Australia with its flawed vaccine rollout, it’s abandoned businesses and workers by pulling away the safety nets that have allowed hundreds of thousands to remain employed and kept millions above the poverty line. By ending jobkeeper the government consigned 150,000 to unemployment nationally, right at the time when the jobseeker unemployment benefit is being slashed to $43.57 a day. The Brisbane lockdown will guarantee that more people will be forced out of work and into poverty. It’s unconscionable that this government can leave thousands of businesses and millions of workers to fend for themselves knowing full well that their failure to bring Covid under control leaves them vulnerable. A floods update from AAP: A handful or residents in Sydney’s north-west are still awaiting the all clear to return home more than a week after being ordered to evacuate amid major flooding. Large tracts of NSW went under water over the past two weeks as rivers filled by torrential rain broke their banks. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from homes across the state, with Sydney’s Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley and the mid-north coast the hardest hit. As the cleanup from the widespread flood continues in earnest, evacuation orders remain in place for four areas along the Hawkesbury River. Residents living in parts of Pitt Town Bottoms, Cornwallis, Freemans Reach and Pitt Town North are still waiting for the State Emergency Service to allow them to return after evacuating on 21 March. A sewage spill has also kept some people from returning home in Stuarts Point, near Nambucca Heads on the NSW mid north coast. An evacuation order was issued on 26 March, after septic systems overflowed into yards and streets, impacting 45 homes, police say. NSW Health deemed there to be a health risk from faecal matter and bacteria in the discharge. Impacted streets have now dried out and been disinfected, and all roads are open again. Individual homes are still part of the exclusion zone however, with authorities assessing them before people are allowed to return. My colleague Nino Bucci has taken a close look at the experiences of alleged rape victims in the Australian court system. His piece is worth your time.

South Australia has recorded no new community cases of Covid-19, with the three infections detected over the past 24 hours contained in medi-hotels. As we noted earlier, the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, has called for upper Hunter MP Michael Johnsen to immediately resign from parliament following reports alleging he sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in the state’s Parliament House. For more details, my colleague Michael McGowan has filed this report. The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, remains in Covid-19 self-isolation after coming into contact with family members visiting from Queensland and developing cold-like symptoms, reports AAP. Gunner’s family arrived in Darwin from Toowoomba on Friday, a week after a man infected with the UK strain of the virus started moving about the state’s south-east. “He’s at home isolating waiting for his Covid test results to come back,” the NT deputy chief minister, Nicole Manison, told reporters on Tuesday. “The advice from the chief health officer is that the risk is very low.” The NT declared Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan, the Toowoomba region, the Moreton Bay region and Redland hotspots from 4.30pm on Monday. Another eight coronavirus cases emerged overnight in greater Brisbane, which was locked down for three days at 5pm on Monday to slow infection rates. Gunner went into self-isolation late on the same day after calling into an NT’s Covid-19 state emergency management committee meeting from another office at NT Parliament House. “Some family members arrived and he’s got some minor cold-type symptoms and he’s doing the right thing and taking extra precaution here,” Manison told reporters on Monday afternoon. Manison said Mr Gunner’s family members were also self-isolating and would be tested for the virus. “Clearly there’s a risk. I think the risk is really small but the fact the chief has some symptoms it’s very appropriate to go and get a test,” the NT chief health officer, Hugh Heggie, said. Manison said she did not know when the chief minister’s Covid-19 test results would be made public. I won’t go through the new ministry again, but the new ministers have now been sworn in. Morrison and Hurley have just taken a photo with the new ministers, which is to say they stood on either side of a large TV screen, where the ministers’ faces were visible on Zoom. And that’s that. Christian Porter, who has been shifted from attorney general to minister for science and industry, has been sworn in. It is the first time Porter has appeared publicly since he took mental health leave. For those wondering, the oath is: I, Charles Christian Porter, do swear that I will well and truly serve the people of Australia in the office of minister for industry, for science and to and that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, so help me God. Linda Reynolds also appeared for the first time since she took leave for health reasons. Scott Morrison is currently sitting down with the governor general, David Hurley, to present his new ministry. The swearing in is taking place online, meaning the new ministers are hoping up their signature to their computer screen after taking the oath. It’s all a bit weird, but so are the times, I guess. This is from AAP. The Australian Academy of Science has apologised for welcoming incoming minister Christian Porter to the portfolio after copping widespread backlash. The organisation of Australia’s top research scientists has backtracked on an initial statement, which read: “We look forward to working with incoming Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter.” It described the tweet as “poorly worded” after dozens of people replied by raising historic rape allegations against Porter, which he strenuously denies. “We apologise. We are deeply aware of the challenging circumstances created by the reshuffle. We will always work to advance science in Australia for all,” the academy said on Tuesday. The backlash highlights ongoing problems plaguing Scott Morrison after rejigging his frontbench lineup. Porter has been demoted as attorney general but will remain in cabinet. Linda Reynolds will also stay on the frontbench – moving from defence to government services – despite mishandling rape allegations raised by former staffer Brittany Higgins. Morrison has used a cabinet reshuffle to try and lift his government out of a crisis over the treatment of women. The number of women in cabinet has been restored to seven and a new ministerial task force has been established to deal with women’s equality, safety and economic security. The prime minister and governor general David Hurley will attend a swearing-in ceremony in Canberra on Tuesday, while ministers gaining new roles will appear via video conference. AGL’s chief executive, Brett Redman, has responded to the Victorian government’s decision to reject the company’s proposal for a new gas terminal and pipeline at Crib Point off the Mornington Peninsula because it would have unacceptable impacts on the environment. At an investor briefing on Tuesday, Redman said the government told the company it was blocking the project based on the recommendations of an independent review by an inquiry and advisory committee. Redman said: As you can appreciate, it’s quite a complex decision, we were given a copy late last night, the team is still pulling it apart to understand it. I’m not really in a position therefore to talk to it directly today beyond acknowledging the decision of the minister, and the detail that has come out that we need to consider properly. He told investors that in the context of AGL’s broader gas portfolio, the project was one proposal among “many sources of supply”. “I note that in this financial year alone, in the last nine months, we’ve signed around 150 petajoules of new supply arrangements, and that’s in this financial year alone,” Redman said. “So, while I had been hoping to have made a seventh announcement today, clearly we will be satisfied with six for the moment, and the seventh we still need to understand properly.” Apple will allow independent repairers in Australia and New Zealand to sign up to a new program this week that will provide access to its tools and spare parts, as the company faces heat on the right to repair. Josh Taylor has more. Long-serving South Australian Greens MP Mark Parnell will quit parliament early after previously announcing plans not to contest the state election in March next year, reports AAP. Parnell has served in the upper house for more than 15 years, but says he will retire from politics next week. The Greens recently chose former senator Robert Simms to be the party’s lead candidate at the state poll, giving him a strong chance of being elected to the Legislative Council. Simms will now be named as the party’s nominee to fill the casual vacancy caused by Mr Parnell’s decision. “As I won’t be re-contesting the next election, it makes sense to give Rob an opportunity to make his mark in state parliament and to become more familiar with key state issues before the election next year,” Parnell said on Tuesday. Hello everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes here. Thanks to Matilda Boseley for her excellent work steering the ship. I’ll be with you for the afternoon. You can get in touch by email via luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @lukehgomes. Let’s get into it. And with that, I will hand you over to Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will guide you through the afternoon. Victoria’s latest round of $200 travel vouchers was snapped up in three minutes, AAP reports. The 50,000 vouchers for travel in regional Victoria were released on Tuesday morning. It is the largest release of the vouchers, with 200,000 now taken up by Victorians. The website crashed when the first batch was released last December. “It’s quite it’s quite extraordinary how quick, whether it’s the 40,000 we had allocated for greater Melbourne or all the rounds of vouchers for regional Victoria – they just go like that,” said acting premier James Merlino. The scheme was launched to boost the local tourism sector, which was ravaged by the state’s Covid-19 lockdowns. Each of the latest vouchers involves $400 being spent on accommodation, tours or attractions in Victoria between 6-31 May. If you are playing the blog drinking game (which I’ve just made up) it’s time to take a shot because Annastacia Palaszczuk has once again delivered some truly baffling graphic design choices on Twitter. I beg you, if the premier’s social media person is reading this right now, please message me. I need to know if she demands these or if you have just gone totally rogue. We knew this already but no new local cases in NSW over night! The amazing Amy Remeikis is doing the Lord’s work and is liveblogging the ALP national conference, something I have neither the know-how or the patience to do. And, most amazingly, she is making it really interesting. Check it out here: The Victorian government has rejected AGL’s proposal for a gas import terminal in Western Port in the state’s south because of unacceptable impacts it would have on the environment, including internationally significant wetlands. AGL had proposed constructing a terminal at Crib Point off the Mornington Peninsula and building a pipeline from the terminal to Pakenham. The proposal had attracted fierce opposition from local councils, community and environment groups, the local federal MP, Greg Hunt, and the Victorian Liberal and National parties. On Tuesday, the state’s planning minister, Richard Wynne, said the government had concluded that marine discharge from the project would have unacceptable effects on the environment of Western Port, which is listed under the Ramsar convention as an internationally significant wetland. He said his decision was based on both AGL’s environment effects statement and an independent review by an inquiry and advisory committee that had received more than 6,000 submissions. This has been an exhaustive, open and transparent process and this is the right outcome for the local community, the environment and Victoria as a whole ... It’s very clear to me that this project would cause unacceptable impacts on the Western Port environment and the Ramsar wetlands – it’s important that these areas are protected. The South Australian government had denied using state websites to collect and track data for the Liberal party, reports AAP. Recent media reports suggested people accessing government websites were being redirected through a data harvesting platform called NationBuilder. But premier Steven Marshall said in a statement on Tuesday there had never been any retention of information. No data is being collected or retained when clicking on the links referred to in media reports... As NationBuilder has confirmed this morning, ‘this URL is not redirecting any users to NationBuilder’s platform – it is a reference link generated by Mimecast, a website analytics provider and no data is being collected or retained when users click on these links. Marshall said it was likely that when parts of media releases were copied and pasted into SA government websites, the original links were still being detected by Mimecast. The premier said to ensure there was no confusion among journalists or members of the public, the government would now use a different system for distributing media releases. But the Labor opposition called for an independent inquiry into the issue. Government accountability spokesman Tom Koutsantonis said South Australians turned to government websites for trusted information and had every right to ask what was happening to their personal data. Albanese: We are going to invest in Australian workers and Australian skills, a new era of national reconstruction to achieve our potential, a country that makes things and creates better jobs to go with them. Victory over the pandemic followed by victory for those whose sacrifices made it possible. This new platform that will be considered by our delegates reflects many things that I know to be true – my unwavering belief in Australians, my respect for the frontline workers, underpaid and undervalued, who endured so much to keep our country safe, the nurses, the aged care workers, the childcare workers, the retail workers, the cleaners, the truckies, the public servants and those in emergency services and more. I am determined to repay them with a better future, but words, of course, aren’t enough. So let’s win the next election and give Australians a government that’s on their side, a government that believes in their capacity to build a stronger, more secure nation. Anthony Albanese is going hard on the election pitch, and is also speaking in extremely long sentences: Unlike [the Liberals], we refuse to accept that the world before the pandemic, with all its imperfections, is the best our nation can do, because the pandemic laid bare some unacceptable truths, about an aged care system in crisis, about millions of Australians in jobs that simply aren’t safe or secure, millions more in jobs that don’t pay enough or have enough hours, women’s voices going unheard, a voice for First Nations people being denied, and the realities of climate change being ignored. A government so addicted to marketing spin that it is now spinning itself and the country into the ground. They have no plan for the future, none. My question for the country is this: after such a year of sacrifice, is this all they can offer us in return? Labor will offer more. We will say to Australians, we are on your side. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking now at the ALP conference in Sydney. He will officially launch his proposed $15bn kitty to drive pandemic recovery and bring manufacturing jobs back home. I have the feeling this is going to be very dull but I shall bring you the best bits. Reports are emerging from Hobart that next year’s controversial arts festival Dark Mofo may not go ahead. The Mercury is reporting that following the furore caused by Spanish artist Santiago Sierra – who was calling for First Nations people to donate their blood into which a Union Jack flag was to be immersed – the festival’s organisers, the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), are pulling the plug for the 2022 event and replacing it with an all-Indigenous event called Blak Mofo. Authorities from the museum and festival have yet to confirm the rumours, which the Mercury says were outlined in an email sent to staff on Monday. The Guardian is seeking comment from MONA owner David Walsh and Dark Mofo creative director Leigh Carmichael. One point from that press conference that’s worth highlighting again is one of the five new cases from the Byron Bay hen’s cases was a man who has since visited an aged care home in the Gold Coast. He was reportedly the entertainer at the party. Palasczcuk says all residents of the home had been vaccinated with at least one dose, but the staff had not: One of the positive cases in that second cluster attended the hen’s party as an entertainer. And he came back and he lives in the Gold Coast and he works as a tradie, and he did go to an aged care facility in the Gold Coast. But every resident in that aged care facility has already been vaccinated, had their first dose. I haven’t got confirmation about whether any have received their second dose. He’s one of those five [new cases from the nurse cluster]. So, we’re working with the commonwealth to respond to that aged care facility. The team down at the Gold Coast are organising to go to the facility today and vaccinate the staff of that facility. News from South Australia: Australians stranded overseas due to strict caps on quarantine spaces have filed a petition against the Australian government to the United Nations’ human rights committee in Geneva. The group StrandedAussies.org is claiming that Australian government has “arbitrarily breached their right to return to the land of their birth or citizenship”, and that the caps on incoming flights have prevented them from returning, despite the fact that they are willing to comply with all necessary public health measures, including 14 days’ quarantine in Australia. Their petitions also point out that Australia has breached the UN’s international covenant because they have no effective remedy – they cannot go to court to require the government to live up to its obligations to permit its citizens to return home. The action is backed by constitutional law Professor Kim Rubenstein, who has provided evidence, as well as Geoffrey Robertson QC, who has given legal advice to the petitioners. Robertson said: International law recognises the strong bond between individuals and their homeland and no respectable government would impose travel caps to prevent, for over a year, its citizens from returning if they are prepared to do quarantine. Both our political parties have, in the past, done what they can to help Australians overseas but Mr Morrison is behaving as if in a moral vacuum – he does not seem to care very much about the suffering caused to fellow Australians. More than 36,000 Australians remain stranded overseas as a result of the arrival caps – limits requested by state and territory governments to ease pressure on their quarantine facilities that the commonwealth government, which manages international borders, mandates. Labor have called for the government to introduce more commonwealth quarantine facilities to help boost capacity for Australians to return. The Australian National Audit Office is currently examining the caps as part of its audit of the international border management during Covid, while constitutional law experts first raised concerns about the caps in August. Arrival caps have also proved controversial in other countries. Earlier this month, Israel’s high court annulled its government’s daily arrival cap of 3,000 – far larger than Australia’s intake – ruling it was unconstitutional as it was disproportionate and violated the country’s civil rights. The next thing to figure out is what happened with health worker vaccination. Some are blaming the federal government for not rolling out the vaccine fast enough; others are blaming the state government for not prioritising health workers. Here is what we heard today from the state government: Chief health officer Jeannette Young says it was always the plan that once all frontline health workers were vaccinated THEN the state would dictate that only vaccinated workers could interact with Covid-19 positive patients. This is set to come into effect tomorrow when the first dose vaccinations are completed. About 89% of frontline health workers are vaccinated now. The infected/unvaccinated nurse did work on Covid-19 wards BUT it’s not believed this is where she picked it up. Young says she was infected on 23 March during a shift where she had no direct contact with infected people, which means another hospital worker could have had the virus and spread it from a traveller to her. The nurse wasn’t vaccinated yet as she was on leave. Young says because of the boom in infected returned travellers they had too many Covid-19 positive people in hospital to only use staff who had had a vaccine dose. Queensland health minister Yvette D’Arth blamed the slow vaccination of healthcare workers on the slow and stuttering supply of vaccine doses from the federal government. She says they couldn’t use all the Pfizer vaccine doses they were given because they had to save half, as there was uncertainty on if the second dose would be delivered from overseas. OK so let’s break down what we just learned: There are eight new locally acquired cases of the UK variant of coronavirus: five of those active cases are definitely linked to a known cluster, one active case that’s probably linked, and two historical cases that are likely linked to the old cluster. Rather than there being one large cluster, as was suspected yesterday, there is actually two totally distinct clusters both starting at the Princess Alexandria Hospital in Brisbane. We will call them the “doctor cluster” and the “nurse cluster” for now. Doctor cluster – likely seven cases (not including original traveller): The first person in this cluster was a doctor at the Princess Alexandria Hospital who was diagnosed in early March. It was originally thought she did not infect anyone. A man in Stafford was diagnosed last Friday and it’s believed he infected a man in Strathpine. The brother of one of these two men was found to be a historical case. He is no longer infectious but is believed to be the missing link between this cluster and the doctor. Two of the the Strathpine man’s workmates were diagnosed on Monday, including one who travelled in Gladstone while infected. On Tuesday two more historical cases were discovered and are believed to be linked to this cluster. Nurse cluster – likely seven cases (not including original traveller): An unvaccinated nurse was infected while at work and had the exact same genomic sequences as a traveller from India who was admitted to the hospital on 22 March. She worked in the Covid-19 ward on 18 March but is NOT believed to have contracted it then. She then worked on 23 March in a non-Covid-19 ward. She is believed to have been infected that night but they do not know how yet. Another worker may have been infected by the traveller and then infected her. She then infected her sister. Before they knew they had Covid-19 but while infectious they travelled to Byron Bay, reportedly for a hen’s night. Five other attendees at the Byron Bay party have now been infected. One of those infected was a male entertainer who works as a tradie on the Gold Coast. He visited a Gold Cost aged care home afterwards, but all residents had been vaccinated with at least one dose. All have returned to Queensland, one may be in Hervey Bay. One other case – There is one other local case. They are definitely a close contact to another case but they aren’t sure which cluster they belong to yet. (Go figure!) Chief health officer Jeannette Young says there may be a case in Hervey Bay related to the nurse cluster: There’s a case in the Hervey Bay area that we’re just looking at, at the moment. There may or may not be an issue there, but we’re looking at it ... That’s one of the cases related to the second cluster. Queensland deputy police commissioner Doug Smith says while no fine has been handed out, one man was arrested in part due to Covid-19 infractions: We’ve seen one arrest related to Covid but that person was intercepted for serious criminal offences and during the arrest, decided to cough on police and has been charged with a serious assault as a result of that ... A number of intercepts, street checks and the like. No fines have been handed out and all of the concerns so far have been reports of people coming out of affected areas and checking on them. In all instance, no reports of parties. We’ve handed out 216 masks to date and we’ll continue to do that and we’ll work with the community to make sure that they continue to do the right thing. Yvette D’Ath says the infected nurse hadn’t been vaccinated as she was on leave: Inevitably, there will be staff who were on leave and this nurse at the PA had actually been on leave for a month was due to get her vaccine this week. So there is always going to be those on leave, who are sick and for other reasons, hadn’t come forward and got vaccinated yet. And we are identifying all of those people now so we can get them vaccinated, but irrespective of whether they’re vaccinated or not, we’ll get to that point as of tomorrow that we have to use only vaccinated staff. Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath has taken a gentle swing at the federal government, aiming to push the blame for unvaccinated healthcare workers back on the slow national vaccine rollout, rather than decisions made by the state: In relation to the vaccine, first of all, the amount of vaccine that we have been supplied by the commonwealth did not all arrive on the first day. So it has progressively increased, just as our vaccinations have progressively increased. In fact, we did 6,004 vaccinations yesterday, so that is a record number of vaccinations and we’ve done 65,129 now. So 65,129 as of yesterday. So every day, we’re increasing the vaccinations, but, we had to wait for consistency of supply. Also remember, we also had to keep some in reserve for the second vaccination because particularly around Pfizer, so the majority of all of our 1as, this the Pfizer. So certainly in the six major hubs, they all got Pfizer. We have to hold back enough Pfizer to give them their second vaccination because we can’t be sure and even the commonwealth can’t be sure when that Pfizer delivery is goings to come to Australia, and also when it is going to get out to the individual states ... Until we get the CSL AstraZeneca out to every state on a weekly basis, we have to be careful to make sure that we manage the vaccines. Young has defended the state’s vaccine rollout program for health workers. (It’s interesting to note that the nurse wasn’t working directly on the Covid-19 ward the night it’s believed she was infected, as was previously assumed. However non-vaccinated workers were still allowed on the ward generally.) Young says all frontline health workers will be vaccinated in the next 48 hours: So, as of tomorrow, I will mandate, as I have been saying now for several weeks to the hospital and health services, that only people who have had their first dose of the vaccine, whether it be Pfizer or AstraZeneca, can work directly with confirmed cases of Covid, and that was always our plan. So, we did set ourselves that target for between four and six weeks to get all of 1a workers vaccinated. We’ve reached that. We believe we’ll have finished that by tomorrow. And then the plan was always, once we had people vaccinated, because we needed to have people available to look after all these cases. As you heard earlier, we’ve gone very, very rapidly from five cases in just over a month to 78. So, we need staff to look after these cases. And I’m very grateful to the staff who have been doing this work ... And now all of those staff will have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, so it will be mandated that only vaccinated staff can work directly with Covid-positive cases. All these clusters are a bit confusing but Young has broken it down a bit: I have initially got three cases related to the PA doctor back earlier in March [the doctor cluster]. Right? Then I’ve got an additional five cases that are confirmed that are related to that cluster [the doctor cluster]. Then I have got two more cases that I’m investigating that I suspect are related to that cluster, right? So, that’s one cluster. [These are the two historic cases, likely linked to the doctor cluster.] Then my second cluster, I’ve got seven confirmed cases related to that cluster [the nurse cluster]. Plus, of course, the original case who travelled from India that has led to that cluster. So, one plus seven. Then I’ve got another case that’s one or the other cluster. Personally, I’m still confused. I’ll bring you a simpler version as soon as the presser is over. Young says she doesn’t know which cluster that last community transmission case is linked to but she does know they are a close contact of a previous case. It sounds like all the information gathering for this press conference was pretty down to the line. Young says the two cases under investigation are historic cases that are likely linked to the older “Doctor cluster”: So, there are two cases that I believe at this stage – but I do need more confirmation – are linked to the first cluster. And they are positive on serology ... So we’ve just got to do some more work on those two cases. They’re PCR-negative, so they are not currently infectious, but they are reactive on serology and they are close contacts of people involved in the first cluster. Young: Then there are a further five cases that I’ve been informed of overnight linked to that nurse or her sister. So, they’re all linked cases, and they all attended a party together down in Byron Bay. So, we’re just working through all of those specific details. This is very recent information. So, we have those five cases linked to that nurse, so we now have seven in that cluster. Young says it’s believed the Covid-19 positive nurse she announced yesterday acquired Covid-19 while at work: The first cluster is related to that doctor at the PA Hospital who treated a confirmed case. And you would remember that she acquired it from a confirmed case in the hospital, and also that case had passed it on to another traveller in the hotel when they were in hotel quarantine. So, there were those three cases earlier [in] March. Then since then we now have these new cases that we picked up in the community. And I’m very grateful to that first young man who came forward and got tested, and the second gentleman – so, they live in northern Brisbane – so, those two cases. Then we’ve had other cases connected to those. And we know they’re all linked because of the genome sequence. They’re all a B117 linked back to that case at the PA Hospital. Then we have a second cluster, and this is the nurse that I told you about yesterday. So, she worked at the PA Hospital on 18 March in the Covid ward. But we now have the genome sequence result back ... she has exactly the same genome ... to a gentleman who arrived and was treated in the PA Hospital and was tested on 22 March. So, after the nurse worked in the Covid ward, she did do a shift on the night of 23 March, so that shift started 10pm that night, she worked through the night into the next day on the 24th. So, my hypothesis ... is that she has acquired the infection when at work that night. Now, I don’t know whether she’s got it directly from that patient, because she wasn’t working with Covid cases that night, but we have to confirm that, or whether she’s got it from someone else in the hospital. Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says the two cases under investigation are likely linked to the older cluster: So, we’ve had 10 new cases overnight. Six of them are locally acquired cases. Five of them related to the second cluster ... One, we’re still working out which cluster they’re related to, but we know they are a contact of a case. So, we have six linked locally acquired cases, which is good – they’re all linked. Then we have two cases that were acquired overseas and detected in hotel quarantine. So, both came from the Philippines via Papua New Guinea into Queensland. So, they’re fine and being managed. Then we have two other cases that are under investigation, so we’re just working through those cases. We believe they’re older cases linked to the first cluster. Palaszczuk: The good news is that these cases are linked and we now believe that there are two distinct clusters. So, we have a cluster linked, of course, to that PA doctor. And we have a second cluster linked to the PA nurse. So, close contacts of both of those clusters. And Dr Young will go into more details. No words yet on how those two under investigation cases are linked to these clusters. Annastacia Palaszczuk is speaking now: I can report that we have 10 new cases overnight. Now, eight of these are community acquired cases. Six are close contacts of confirmed cases. And two are currently under investigation, but we believe that they are also linked to the two people. So, two are also overseas-acquired, and once again coming via Papua New Guinea. Criminal charges against the missing Sydney conwoman Melissa Caddick will be dropped by the corporate watchdog, five weeks after her badly decomposed foot washed up on a beach. A warrant for the 49-year-old’s arrest had been issued on behalf of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which had laid almost 40 charges against Caddick. The charges will be formally withdrawn in Sydney’s Downing Centre local court on Tuesday. The fraudster went missing last November, a day after Asic executed a search warrant at her eastern Sydney home. You can read the full report below: Victoria reports no new Covid cases We are standing by now to get a Covid-19 update from Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. That’s due to start any moment. Foreign affairs minister and, as Scott Morrison said yesterday the new “prime minister for women” Marise Payne has spoken to Sydney radio station 2GB this morning. She was asked for her reaction to reports that NSW state nationals MP Michael Johnsen had allegedly sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in Parliament House. Johnsen stepped aside from his position as a parliamentary secretary and moved to the crossbench after it was revealed he was the subject of a six-month police investigation into rape allegations made by the same sex worker. It is completely, absolutely, utterly inappropriate, and it is deeply, deeply distressing for many of us who work and have an enormous respect for the role that we’ve held for so many years ... We as parliamentarians have to own the problems, have to own the failings, and frankly, we must own the solutions because if we don’t, it won’t change and that’s our obligation. But despite talking about owning solutions, the minister for women didn’t seem too open to the “solution” to the “federal Liberal MP Andrew Laming problem” that many are calling for. Laming has been accused of harassing two women online and “upskirting” another. He has said he will not contest the next election but the Liberal party has not asked him to move to the crossbench or resign from parliament, a move that would plunge the government into minority. Radio host Ben Fordham asked if Payne was comfortable with him retaining his roll with a salaray of “more than $200,000 a year”: Well, importantly, he has taken responsibility for his actions and there are two things that are happening as a result of that. The first is that he is [has] been taking time to do the sorts of training and instruction, and awareness-raising that frankly should have been in place before, and that is something that he has decided to do of his own volition, and he should. Secondly, he has indicated that he has taken a very serious decision to leave parliament at the completion of [his term]. He’s been elected by the people of Bowman, they made that decision, they’ll serve out his term, and then he leaves the parliament. I think that that is the response to these behaviours but importantly, I hope it shows that others would seek to engage in this sort of activity that is completely unacceptable and that it must change. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking now about Labor proposed policy to bring manufacturing back to Australia if elected: Australians making sacrifices to look after each other is seeing us through the pandemic, but it’s also shown up some of the weaknesses in our economy. The fact that we’re not resilient enough, that we’re susceptible to shocks, the fact that we didn’t have enough PPE, we didn’t have enough ventilators, there’s a whole range of products that we’re simply not producing ... [The] Australia’s national reconstruction fund that Labor would create, of $15bn, to partner with the private sector, including superannuation funds, will drive future jobs growth and our economy. It will be particularly beneficial for our regions. It will apply to sectors across the board, such as defence industry, such as existing businesses that need to transition towards zero net emissions. It will be an important tool going forward to build confidence in our economy. We know that investment is actually going backwards, that we’re not seeing enough business investment in this country. And we also know that Australia has been fantastic at research and innovation, everything from new solar energy technology through to wine casks, through to wi-fi... It’s a part of Labor’s focus on jobs, which will be the centre of our recovery. You can read more here: Over the past year, various members of the Redfern Shanty Club found different ways to cope. Robert Boddington, with his thespian’s voice and easy stage patter, gathered a few friends and tried to sing in public places, “just turning up in the dead of night and quietly singing away”. Robin Howard says he got “the shakes”. Emma Norton, a train driver with a soaring Celtic voice, says: “I sang to myself a lot, I guess.” On Monday night, as restrictions in Sydney were almost completely lifted – with relaxed caps on capacity in bars, and no limits on singing – this devoted and joyous community finally returned to their favourite weekly ritual. The sea shanty night, which operates out of the Dock bar in Redfern, was put on hold early last year. It had been running for seven years, after being started by the Sydney comedian Carlo Ritchie, who Boddington says “used to sing in Berlin with some mates over a roast dinner on Mondays”, and brought the idea back home. You can read Naaman’s full (very entertaining) story below: The nation’s stocks of blood after running low after widespread, record-breaking floods across NSW saw a drop in donations, reports Tiffanie Turnbull from AAP. The Australian Red Cross is calling for more people to roll up their sleeves ahead of the Easter weekend, with O-negative bloods donors in particular need. O-negative is particularly important over the Easter period when supplies are often challenged, Lifeblood executive director Cath Stone said in a statement: O-negative is the universal blood type and can be given to anyone in an emergency, such as a road trauma, when there simply isn’t time to find out someone’s blood type ... Only 9% of Australians have O-negative blood, but it makes up 17% of orders from hospitals because it saves lives in emergencies. An extra 8,000 donations are needed to boost stocks back to normal levels. We understand so much has been asked of Australians over the last 12 months, from bushfires, to the pandemic and now floods ... While we’ve appealed for donors multiple times already this year, the number of people responding simply isn’t meeting patient demand. Berejiklian has flagged the possibility of stricter Covid-19 restrictions in NSW if cases are discovered. If you’ve attended any of the venues in New South Wales which New South Wales Health has identified, get tested, stay home and isolate for the full 14 days and, as Dr Chant said, we also expect you to take a second test towards the end of your isolation period to make sure you haven’t developed the disease or been diagnosed in the meantime ... This all is all to keep the broader community in New South Wales safe. This is to make sure that we do everything we can to not unnecessarily burden our citizenships. We want to continue the path that we’re on in New South Wales. But I want to say the situation is evolving and if cases are identified in New South Wales, we will have to respond. I’m hoping it doesn’t come to that but, given that we did have two infected people at a number of venues in New South Wales, we should brace ourselves. NSW is on high alert after two of the Covid-19 positive people in the Queensland cluster visited Byron Bay while infectious. Gladys Berejiklian says there are no cases identified in the state so far but has urged people to renew their hygiene efforts. We’re asking everybody to be alert, to make sure you get tested if you have the mildest of symptoms and, of course, if you’ve been to Brisbane since 20 March, please make sure you continue to update yourself on the venues which the Queensland government have stated have been attended by infected persons. Please also make sure that if you returned to New South Wales [from] Brisbane, that you comply with whatever lockdown provisions are in place in Brisbane. If you’ve come back since 20 March and the Queensland government said that Brisbane residents have to be in lockdown for three days, you hve to follow that here in New South Wales, but for those exemptions that are available. I hope that we do not have any cases arise in New South Wales but I would not be surprised if we did, so we must brace ourselves. The New South Wales government is confident that we have provisions in place to get on top of it if any cases are revealed. Dr Chant is in regular contact with Queensland authorities and she will be able to provide an update on those conversations but suffice to say we are expecting more cases from Queensland and hopefully most of those cases will be people in isolation although we have to assume this is an evolving situation. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now. Michael McGowan has more on that news from NSW: The New South Wales deputy premier and leader of the Nationals, John Barilaro, has called for Upper Hunter MP Michael Johnsen to immediately resign following reports in the ABC claiming he had sought to arrange for a sex worker to visit him in Parliament House. Johnsen is a Nationals MP who stepped aside from his position as a parliamentary secretary and moved to the crossbench after it was revealed he was the subject of a six-month police investigation into rape allegations made by a sex worker. On Tuesday the ABC reported Johnsen had offered the woman $1,000 to attend NSW parliament for sex, as well as sending the woman a string of lewd text messages and an obscene video while parliament was sitting. Responding to the reports, Barilaro said he had contacted Johnsen on Tuesday morning and “expressed the view that his position as member of parliament is untenable”. This is disgusting behaviour and will never be acceptable, nor should it be and I’m calling for him to resign from parliament immediately ... It is now up to Mr Johnsen to reconsider his position as an independent member of parliament.” Also responding to the reports, the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the reports were “beyond disgusting”. If that’s correct I’m absolutely disgusted ... For many women in public life we know challenges that exist, but when colleagues and former colleagues do that type of thing it’s beyond disgusting. I want people, not just in politics but in all spheres of life, to be respectful of women and treat them equally. Johnsen stood aside from his position as a parliamentary secretary and moved to the crossbench after the Labor MP Trish Doyle used parliamentary privilege to claim that an unnamed member had allegedly sexually assaulted a sex worker. He released a statement saying he was “devastated” by the allegations, and that he was “confident any investigation will conclude that I am an innocent party”. I have voluntarily spoken with NSW police and I have and will continue to fully cooperate with their inquiries. I am confident any investigation will conclude that I am an innocent party. Johnsen said “as the matter is with the NSW police I will make no further public comment”. NSW Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro has called on MP Michael Johnsen to resign from parliament immediately. This came after an ABC report alleged he paid a sex worker $1,000 to come to parliament for sex and sent the woman lewd text messages and an obscene video while he was sitting in the parliamentary chamber. The report comes a week after the Upper Hunter MP went on leave and moved to the crossbench after denying allegations he raped the same woman at the Blue Mountains in 2019. This morning Barilaro released this statement: There is currently a police investigation under way which we must let proceed without prejudice. In light of this investigation, last week Michael Johnsen was removed from the Nationals and Coalition party rooms and suspended from the National party. Following reports this morning I contacted Mr Johnsen to express the view that his position as a member of parliament is untenable. This is disgusting behaviour and will never be acceptable, nor should it be, and I’m calling for Mr Johnsen to resign from parliament immediately. It is now up to Mr Johnsen to reconsider his position as an independent member of parliament. With a lockdown in Brisbane and fears in NSW over two of the infectious people travelling through Byron Bay, testing around the country has ramped up. In the ACT there aren’t that many testing clinics still operating, given the territory has had approximately one trillion days since a locally acquired infection. Looks like that this has lead to some pretty extensive lines this morning. Mandatory read for this morning is political editor Katharine Murphy’s analysis on the federal cabinet reshape: “Morrison’s cabinet reshuffle makes women responsible for helping men who should know better, be better.” Incredible, really, (and yet crushingly predictable, somehow) that Andrew Laming would have the audacity to make an appeal for privacy while finding the time to front his local radio station and dish some alternative “facts” about unsavoury incidents that have forced him to signal time on his parliamentary career. Also incredible (and yet not, somehow) that the Nationals MP Anne Webster would need to make a formal complaint to the party leadership after being sexually harassed by a male colleague in the House of Representatives chamber (a public place last time I looked) during a week where the government was lurching from disaster to disaster. You can read the full story below: NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says she’s disgusted by a report that a Coalition colleague offered a woman money to have sex with him at NSW parliament, AAP reports. The NSW premier was asked about an ABC report that NSW National party MP Michael Johnsen offered a sex worker $1,000 to come to parliament for sex and sent the woman lewd text messages and an obscene video while he was sitting in the parliamentary chamber. The report comes a week after the Upper Hunter MP went on leave and moved to the crossbench after denying allegations he raped the same woman at the Blue Mountains in 2019. The woman told the ABC she exchanged hundreds of messages with Johnsen after responding to his online advertisement for sex in August, 2019. Berejiklian was asked about the latest report on Sydney radio 2GB on Tuesday. If that is correct I am absolutely disgusted ... For many women in public life when you know the challenges that exist – when colleagues or former colleagues do that type of thing – it is just beyond disgusting. Berejiklian said police were investigating the rape allegation “so I can’t really say more than that”. I want all workplaces and not just in politics, in all spheres of life, to be respectful to women and to treat them equally. She wanted people to acknowledge the subconscious bias that exists against women – “especially those in leadership positions”. My job and the job of others is to lead by example and to call out what is unacceptable behaviour. Not strictly Australian news, but it certainly affects us: maritime passage through the Suez Canal can finally resume after the giant Ever Given cargo ship has been fully refloated. Navigation in the canal resumed at 6pm local time (4pm GMT and ADET), the head of the Suez Canal Authority said, with livestock ships the first to be allowed through. At least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, but analysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end. If you want to know more, check out Guardian Australia’s TikTok channel where I’ve broken the whole situation down into bite-size chunks! The Queensland premier has been asked if the state government will step in to provide economic support to business during the lockdown given the federal jobkeeper system has now expired. Palaszcuck didn’t really give a straight answer on this point: I have been very strong that I absolutely believe that jobkeeper should have been extended, and especially targeted at some further relief measures for especially those businesses in the tourist industry that have been hard-hit by the closures of international borders. A lot of operators across Queensland, of course, are very much looking forward to the school holidays. And we are keeping our fingers crossed that this current breakout can be contained in the three days, which will allow people to go ahead and enjoy their Easter plans. But it’s unfortunate, but we’ve gotta keep the community safe. And I think the tourism industry would be very unforgiving if there was a mass outbreak in one of their tourist hot spots. That would be damaging not just locally, nationally, and in the future internationally. Palaszcuck has been questioned as to why Queensland health authorities could not handle an outbreak of seven cases without locking down the city: Well, we need to do this because this is a highly infectious strain. And we needed to do it quickly. We needed a sharp, hard lockdown. It worked effectively when we did it last time. It is a very big and a very tough call, but I have to take the advice of Health, and I took the advice of Dr Young... And her advice was to do this because we were seeing community transmission out there. And when you have free-flowing, unlimited restrictions in a lot of areas, that means a lot of people gathering, a lot of people meeting, and we needed to contain it quickly, so we needed to do this snap lockdown. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the number of active Covid-19 cases in returned travellers has dramatically increased: We currently have 73 active Covid patients in our hospitals at the moment. Sixty-three of those, I’m told around 63, are people who have acquired that from overseas, that have been in our hotel quarantine. So, a few months ago, we were down to, I think it was two or three positive Covid patients in our hospitals. We have seen a dramatic increase, particularly over the last month, because we are seeing large numbers of returned travellers that are testing positive and are testing positive to that UK strain. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the nurse who has Covid-19 worked one shift while unvaccinated: Well, what I can say is that 41,000 of our frontline health and our hotel quarantine staff have actually received their first vaccine. That’s around 89%. So, that’s a good sign and it’s just unfortunate in this issue that this particular nurse worked one shift in this ward where she was unvaccinated. My understanding is that over the next couple of weeks that will be 100% of people vaccinated, and around 7,000 people have been getting their second vaccinations. So the vaccination rollout is going ahead. But, of course, we want to make sure that that particular cohort gets their vaccine as soon as possible. The Queensland premier says she will give an official update on Covid numbers at 9am Queensland time – 10am in Melbourne and Sydney. She is speaking with ABC News Breakfast now. Scott Morrison’s standing with female voters has taken a hit as the political crisis triggered by the mishandling of Brittany Higgins’ rape allegation became the water cooler issue for the electorate, with the prime minister’s approval rating down 10 points in a fortnight and disapproval up by 10%. The latest Guardian Essential poll confirms Morrison’s approval rating slipped from 62% to 57% in the past fortnight as the the prime minister sought to contain the fallout of federal parliament’s #MeToo moment – with the slide driven by Australian women. While Morrison’s approval with women voters is now down 16 points since the Higgins story broke in February, the prime minister’s standing with male voters has remained unchanged through the fracas, with only a minor uptick in disapproval recorded within the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. You can read the full report below: A huge reward is being offered for information about the cold case murders of a brother and sister in Melbourne’s south-east more than 30 years ago, AAP reports. Doris McCartney, 71, and Ronald Swann, 69, were found dead in their Keith Street home in Moorabbin on 22 October 1989. Both had been assaulted but investigators have been unable to discover why they were killed. Homicide squad Detective Inspector Tim Day said police believed that someone had come to the property to see Doris and there was an altercation: Doris was a widower and her younger brother had moved into her Keith Street home to support her ... From all accounts, they lived a quiet life and police have never been able to determine why they were both murdered. Police are now offering a reward of up to $1m for information about who was responsible for their deaths: There will be someone out there who knows why Doris and Ronald were killed and by who – 31 years is a long time to carry a secret. Labor is rolling out its plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to Australia today. Their plan centres around “a national reconstruction fund”, a $15bn kitty to drive pandemic recovery if Anthony Albanese becomes prime minister. Essentially the government bank would financially support projects across a range of areas such as mining, food and beverage processing, local train manufacturing, car and shipbuilding. Medicines, vaccines and medical devices, defence capabilities and other projects across software, engineering and robotics would also be eligible. The former secretary of Andrew Laming’s Bowman branch says she is surprised it has taken so long for complaints against the Queensland MP to be made public, given his history of making constituents “uncomfortable”. Suzi Foster was one of three branch executive members suspended from the Liberal National party in 2018 when a letter they wrote to members calling for Laming to be disendorsed was made public before electorate pre-selections. Foster told Guardian Australia concerns had been raised about Laming’s “erratic” behaviour from 2016: What has been alleged doesn’t surprise me. I’m just surprised it didn’t happen sooner. Foster quit the LNP after the suspension but had been a member since 2007 and was originally a supporter of Laming. She said she and other members had concerns about Laming’s “temper tantrums” and had pressed for change. You can read the full report below: Plenty of interesting thing from this interview but finally new home affairs minister Karen Andrews has been asked about the Biloela family– a Tamil family with two young children now being held in detention on Christmas Island while legal fights continue over the government’s attempts to deport them. Previous home affairs minister Peter Dutton has been steadfast that the family cannot stay, but some hope Andrews may take a different approach. She has declined to make any decisive comments this morning: So I understand all the issues from the community, I understand that there are a range of legal issues that still need to be addressed, and I will be briefed on that particular case, in more detail, probably tomorrow morning ... There are a significant number of issues, it would be very unwise and inappropriate of me to be commenting on that particular case or any case until I’m fully briefed on all the issues. You can read more about the Biloela family here: Karen Andrews has also been asked about Liberal backbencher Andrew Laming who has been accused of harassing multiple women both on and offline. While he says he will not contest the next election he could remain in parliament for up to a year with the government unwilling to remove him from the Liberal party – a move that would plunge the government into minority. At least one female Liberal MP has come out to condemn Laming, and although Karen Andrews sounded deeply unhappy with him, she stopped short of calling for him to move to the crossbench: Andrew Laming’s behaviour is just not acceptable. It’s just not, and it cannot be rationalised, it cannot be just covered up, and he does need to take responsibility for that. Now he has said that he will own mistakes and he will take action to address that through counselling. Good. I’ll be looking to see what the outcomes of that are, but I would expect significant changes in Andrew Laming’s behaviour because it hasn’t been acceptable ... Fran Kelly: He could sit on the crossbench. Andrews: Well, he could probably do a lot of things. I think the strongest signal that he’s given is that he’s not trying to contest the election. Part of Scott Morrison’s renewed focus on protecting women involved cracking down on social media abuse – which many feel is a slight cop-out given that the majority of the alleged sexual harassment issues in parliament have not been online. New home affairs minister Karen Andrews is being asked about this on ABC radio: The issues that social media presents is not going to be the only solution that we need to look at. It’s clearly exacerbating issues. Going back to the days where kids were able to come home from school or at least get a break, that doesn’t happen now … It has an impact on adults as well, so there are some things that we need to be looking at with social media, and its impact on our lives, not walking away from having to take strong action needed to deal with that. There’s a level of anonymity in social media that is concerning, that people are not making comments under their own name, and they can hide, and I don’t think they should be allowed to hide. Yesterday Scott Morrison announced a major reshuffle of the cabinet, with a special emphasis on women in the cabinet (although he actually added just one woman to the cabinet). Christian Porter and Linda Reynolds were the clear losers in the reshuffle – getting shunted to lesser portfolios – but one of the big winners was Gold Coast MP Karen Andrews, who is the new home affairs minister. Andrews is speaking to ABC radio now and says the new woman’s taskforce in the cabinet really will make a difference to women in Australia. She hasn’t provided many specifics on exactly how: Well, there are specific responsibilities in relation to women ... [There is] a very concerted effort to make sure that the voices of women are heard. And we are reflecting the views of women in the community ... I think what is really, really going to happen is a stronger role for women in developing policies to making sure that the policies that are being developed across government, and being mindful of the impact that they will have on women. Good morning, to everyone, but especially to the Brisbane readers waking up in lockdown today. Matilda Boseley here to make your morning a little less boring and bring you all the news from around the country (since some of you aren’t allowed out your front door). Obviously, Queensland is top of mind today. We are likely to have an update on the overnight Covid-19 numbers sometime this morning, which should give us a sense of how likely the lockdown is to continue – although we won’t get any official word until tomorrow. It’s likely the role the federal government’s slow vaccination rollout played in the outbreak will come to the fore – one of the more worrying community infections in the outbreak is from an unvaccinated nurse working at a Covid-19 ward in a Brisbane hospital. Yesterday premier Annastacia Palaszczuk took a subtle swipe at the federal government, saying local outbreaks and lockdowns were going to be part of the Australian way of life until everyone was vaccinated: It is very important that the vaccination rollout continues and that people continue to book in with their GPs, especially those GPs that are administering the vaccine. But until we have the population vaccinated there is of course the risk of community transmission. More than 541,000 Australians have received their first vaccines, including 259,000 in the past week, but given that the federal government aimed to have 4 million people immunised by April, people are less than impressed. This lockdown also came just as jobkeeper support payments ended, so I dare say that will come up a bit today as well. And it wouldn’t be a 2021 morning without some new news about behaviour towards women in the political world. (Yesterday I chose to listen to a violent true crime murder podcast rather than an update on the state of the gender relations in the government because it was less stressful.) Last night Queensland police confirmed they received information about Liberal backbencher Andrew Laming allegedly taking a photo of a woman whose underwear was showing as she bent over in the workplace. The woman and a witness to the incident on Monday told Nine News they had initiated a complaint with Queensland police. But police later said in a statement the woman had spoken to them on Monday afternoon and was “not proceeding with a formal complaint at this time”: Police are in the initial stages of assessing allegations against a man. Laming claims the photo attempted to show someone trying to fit an impossible amount of stock into a fridge. Although he says he will not contest the next election the government has refused to remove him from parliament, despite Liberal senator Sarah Henderson calling for it, a move that would plunge the government into a minority. The backbencher is now on leave and undergoing empathy training. That might be enough to get us started for today, let’s dive in.

National Grid said the thousands of photovoltaic panels on rooftops and in fields across the UK were generating 8.7GW, or 24.3% of demand at 1pm on Friday, smashing the previous high of 8.48GW earlier this month. Experts said the unprecedented share for solar energy meant about 60% of the UK’s power was low carbon, taking into account Britain’s wind farms and nuclear power stations too. That figure is normally around 50%. National Grid, which is tasked with ensuring a match between supply and demand for electricity, said it was excited but unfazed by the challenge of accommodating “significant volumes” of renewables. Duncan Burt, who manages day-to-day operation of the grid, said: “We have planned for these changes to the energy landscape and have the tools available to ensure we can balance supply and demand.” Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace, said: “Today’s new record is a reminder of what the UK could achieve if our government reversed its cuts to support for solar, and backed the clean technologies that could provide jobs, business opportunities and plentiful clean energy for decades to come.” The milestone reached on Friday is the latest in a series of records for solar, which has grown from almost nothing seven years ago to 12GW of capacity today. Last summer it provided more power than the UK’s last 10 coal-fired power stations. In April this year, Britain achieved its first-ever full working day without coal power since it started burning the fuel in 1882, thanks in part to solar energy. Solar’s rapid growth is overturning conventions for the managers of the UK’s power grid. In March, for the first time ever, the amount of electricity demanded by homes and businesses in the afternoon was lower than it was in the night, thanks to the cut in demand due to solar panels. Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said of the latest record: “I think it’s a positive sign. It’s free electricity today, for the consumer, and we should make the most of it.” He said that with solar continuing to be installed despite the government’s drastic subsidy cuts in 2016, further records will certainly be broken this summer and for years to come. Buckley said the grid could handle a far greater proportion of solar power than currently seen, because gas power stations could be ramped down. For National Grid, periods of high pressure bringing lovely weather to the UK like this week were: “really predictable, so easy to plan for,” Buckley said. Robert Gross of Imperial College said: “This doesn’t pose fundamental problem for the grid – many sunnier countries manage a similar proportion of solar on a much more regular basis.” Government statistics published on Thursday show that UK solar power capacity has grown from 11.3GW in April last year to 12.1GW this year, enough to power 3.8m homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/mar/08/solar-energy-pioneer-monica-oliphant-on-charting-her-own-path-in-science","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T22:35:18Z","webTitle":"Solar energy pioneer Monica Oliphant on charting her own path in science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/08/solar-energy-pioneer-monica-oliphant-on-charting-her-own-path-in-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/08/solar-energy-pioneer-monica-oliphant-on-charting-her-own-path-in-science","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy pioneer Monica Oliphant on charting her own path in science","bodyText":"It was 1973 and Monica Oliphant, a recently widowed mother of two, was washing the dishes one night when she first heard about the potential for solar energy. “[It was] at the time of the Arab oil crisis, and I heard on the radio someone saying, if we had solar energy, we wouldn’t have to fight over oil. That was the 70s and I managed to get work in this area. That was tremendously exciting.” While the word “pioneer” gets bandied around a lot, it seems apt when talking to 75-year-old Oliphant. Recently named South Australia’s senior Australian of the year, her long and brilliant career was recognised last year when she was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia for her work in the renewable energy sector as a research scientist, particularly in solar photovoltaics and power generation. It is even more inspiring considering she studied in the male-dominated area of physics in the early 60s, and went on to carved her own path in the energy sector, all while raising a family single-handedly. As a child, Oliphant had a keen interest in astronomy. She remembers joining a group called the moon watch group, which tracked the Sputnik and explorer satellites, and she had a holiday job at Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra. But she realised the sector wasn’t for her; it was “too abstract”. She did enjoy science and maths, and went on to study physics. She was the only female physics graduate at the University of Adelaide. “There weren’t many in the physics areas when I did honours in physics at Adelaide [University]. I was the only female in my group in 1960 but I never felt I was any different to anyone else in class,” she says. At university she met her husband and fellow physicist Michael Oliphant, son of pre-eminent scientist and former South Australian governor Sir Mark Oliphant. She began working in the male-dominated electricity supply sector at the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA), after completing her studies. “People would ask me where I worked and I’d say, and they’d ask, ‘Are you a receptionist?’” Oliphant stopped working for a time to raise children, but then Michael died of cancer in 1971. He was 35. “My husband died a couple of weeks before my second daughter was born. There was a big mortgage so I had to go back to work. I had to survive financially”, she says. “I wanted to be independent, and I had a five-year-old and newborn to support, so I moved back to Adelaide and got part-time work as a research assistant.” She worked in atomic research at the University of Adelaide and later Flinders University. By 1973, she had become fascinated with solar photovoltaics and renewable energy, and she spent 18 years focusing on renewables at ETSA. There was very little formal childcare in the early 70s, even for women who were single parents. “I only worked part-time initially. There wasn’t much childcare available, so I mainly improvised, but being at a university was helpful.” These days she looks at her adult daughters, both working mothers, and sees that there are still challenges for working women. “My two daughters have husbands, they have been able to have access to childcare but they work enormously hard and they are stressed out in their daily living. It’s not easy. I don’t think it’s easy for females to manipulate both a job and home life.” Oliphant’s career flourished, she says, mainly because she was left alone to pursue her own interests. “I reckon I was the employee from hell but I wanted to do these things and if it wasn’t in the work plan, I would say, ‘maybe I can get funding.’ I would do what I wanted, and they let me. Then I would get funding, so they couldn’t stop me. They thought it was easier to let me go and I probably wouldn’t do much harm.” She had no formal mentors. “The people I worked with were always helpful, but I didn’t have anyone in particular to work with, except for the people in the Australian Solar Energy Society.” Oliphant was also president of the International Solar Energy Society from 2008 to 2009 and it remains one of her career highlights. Much of Oliphant’s work would turn out to be ahead of its time including work in the early 1990s with public housing and examining the impact of energy efficiency of low-income families. “Back then the residential sector was regarded as too diverse and small to be looked at. Monitoring household energy use became mainstreamed shortly afterwards. So there was a lot of interesting work done then. It was enjoyable.” Currently an adjunct associate professor with the division of information technology, engineering and the environment at the University of South Australia, Oliphant remains active in the renewable energy sector. She is working on several projects. “One is on community-owned solar – trying to increase penetration within the community. I have [also] just finished ... a feasibility study on the potential to have a UN university on renewable energy and training in China.” That feasibility study took her and a group of international scientists to Malaysia, Russia and China. The team are currently waiting to see if their work is accepted. She is also the patron of the Corena Fund, a not-for-profit citizen group that collectively funds new renewable energy installations. “I’m fairly busy and I’m having an enjoyable time. If you are involved in something that [you] really believe in and you love, it keeps you going.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T03:08:49Z","webTitle":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","fields":{"headline":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","bodyText":"China is moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable technology as the US pulls away, a new report has said. China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). “As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA. IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth. China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services. “China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said. The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said. “That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.” As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%. Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”. “Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.” The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp. The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal. “[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said. The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles. On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”. However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T01:01:40Z","webTitle":"Web of Australian Adani solar companies leads to offshore tax havens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","fields":{"headline":"Web of Australian Adani solar companies leads to offshore tax havens","bodyText":"Adani has spread its use of offshore tax havens to its Australian solar projects, providing another avenue that could allow the wealthy Indian family behind the transnational to legally minimise tax paid on income from local operations. Six companies linked to Adani’s renewables business, which chairman Gautam Adani wants to make the biggest in Australia by 2022, were registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 3 August. The companies all have Australian-based Adani executives as directors. But they fall into two groups – three companies in each – which follow a markedly different path to their ultimate owners. One trail leads back to Adani Enterprises, the stockmarket-listed company in India which is vying to build Australia’s largest coalmine, and in which the Adani family are the major shareholders. The other bypasses the public company in India entirely, leading back to the Adani family via privately owned companies based in the Cayman and British Virgin islands, recognised tax havens. The companies were registered a month before the energy giant said it would proceed with “one of the world’s most advanced solar energy plants” at Rugby Run near Moranbah, the largest of three plants Adani proposes in central Queensland and South Australia. Gautam Adani trumpeted the group’s Australian solar ambitions when announcing a power purchasing agreement for Rugby Run with an unnamed but “significant power retailer”. “We are the largest generator of solar energy in India and we aim to replicate that in Australia,” he said. Adani bought Rugby Run – a former cattle property once earmarked as a rail thoroughfare for transporting coal from its contentious Carmichael mine – for $1 on 9 June last year from Queensland beef barons the Acton family, transfer documents show. The site gives its name to one of three companies that signal the start of the tax haven trail from the Australian solar business: Adani Rugby Run Operations Pty Ltd, Adani Renewable Operations Pty Ltd and Adani Renewable Operations Holdings Pty Ltd. All three companies have a parent company in Singapore, Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd, which was incorporated in January with Vinod Shantilal Adani as sole director. Singapore company filings show Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd is owned by Atulya Resources Ltd in the Cayman Islands. Atulya Resources is in turn owned by ARFT Holding Ltd in the British Virgin Islands. Documents held by the Singapore corporate regulator disclose that “the Adani Family” is an ultimate shareholder of ARFT Holding Ltd. Back in Australia, the other three companies registered in August were Adani Renewable Assets, Adani Renewable Asset Holdings and Adani Rugby Run. They are held by Adani Global Pte Ltd in Singapore, which is held by Adani Global Ltd in Mauritius, in turn owned by the public company Adani Enterprises Ltd in India. Adam Walters, the principal researcher for Energy Resource Insights, who uncovered the new tax haven links, said Adani’s use of tax havens and parallel company structures was entirely legal. But he said they could enable the Adani family to generate income from operating the solar farms, via agreements with the public Indian parent company that owned the assets. These profits could then be channelled to the Adani family via the Cayman and British Virgin islands, which would have favourable tax implications for them, Walters said. “Rather than benefit because of their shareholdings in listed companies in India where they have to pay lots of tax, they could benefit via the British Virgin Islands,” he said. “What could well be the case is the listed companies have got the money behind them, they can build the things, but then the profits can be generated in the family-owned businesses.” Walters said this was a pattern suggested elsewhere in Adani’s corporate structures around Australian mine and rail projects. It arose when Adani Mining had an opportunity to dispose of a future liability worth billions, in the form of a $2 a tonne royalty deed held by the original owner of the Carmichael mine site, Linc Energy. When a distressed Linc agreed to offload the deed for $150m in 2014, it was not Adani Mining that bought it. Instead, Adani Mining lent $150m to an Adani family-held trust, linked to the rail project, to snap it up. “This means that the family could potentially receive over a billion dollars in the Caribbean even if the mine is unprofitable in Australia,” Walters said. “Adani Mining, rather than spending $150m, now have an IOU on their balance sheet for $150m. In the short term, the company looks healthier than it actually is and in the longer term, if the mine does go ahead then the Adani family make the money.” The trust that could enrich the family through coal royalties is held via the same tax haven companies as the solar companies. The $150m was one of several multimillion-dollar loans in Australia by public Adani company subsidiaries to private Adani family-owned companies. “If [the solar business] is the same as elsewhere, we know the Adani family has not actually put a single dollar into Australia – they’re inter-company loans to the family from the listed company,” Walters said. He said there were another three trusts registered by Adani in Australia around the solar projects but “beneficial ownership of these remains unclear at this stage”. The chief executive of Adani Mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, has dismissed any suggestion the Australian operations would be “hiding profits” via holding companies in tax havens. “There is absolutely no implication of this, as everything that is being done in Australia or in India is transparent,” he told India’s Economic Times. “We make regular filings to the tax offices and government authorities. This report is a desperate attempt by the activists who were not able to legally stall the [Carmichael] project or get the government to do it. “This is their last attempt to hurt the goodwill we enjoy, but we are going ahead with the project as planned.” The 175-megawatt plant would rate among Australia’s biggest solar projects, along with Adani’s proposed 100MW farm at Crinium Creek, also in central Queensland, and a 140MW far near Whyalla in South Australia. Adani is the largest solar generator in India. Adani declined to comment on the company arrangements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/please-think-again-readers-respond-to-solar-energy-cuts-interactive","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-26T08:00:11Z","webTitle":"'Please think again': readers respond to solar energy cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/please-think-again-readers-respond-to-solar-energy-cuts-interactive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/nov/26/please-think-again-readers-respond-to-solar-energy-cuts-interactive","fields":{"headline":"'Please think again': readers respond to solar energy cuts","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/dec/05/american-wilderness-trump-energy-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-05T11:14:16Z","webTitle":"Lost lands?

The American wilderness at risk in the Trump era","bodyText":"In the great expanses of the Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument, the silence hits you first. Minutes pass, smooth and unbroken as glass. The smallest sound – a breath of wind, a falling rock – can seem as loud as passing traffic. Colter Hoyt knows this landscape well. As an outdoor guide, he walks the monument almost daily. Yet these days he is full of fear. This remote paradise of red rocks, slot canyons and towering plateaus faces an uncertain future, following a controversial presidential proclamation that removed 800,000 acres from the monument and opened land up for potential energy development. When Trump took office in 2016, he promised the energy industry a new era of “American energy dominance”. This would only be possible by exploiting America’s 640m acres of public land: mountains, deserts, forests and sites of Native American history that cover more than a quarter of the country. The US government has the discretion to decide what use a parcel of public land should be put towards, such as conservation, energy development or grazing. Under Trump, environmental advocates fear a shift to the extreme: land offered indiscriminately for mining and drilling, with disregard for other potential uses. Two years after Trump came to power, a new study produced by the Wilderness Society, a not-for-profit organization advocating for the protection of public lands, and shared exclusively with the Guardian, reveals the full extent of his government’s efforts. Key findings include: 13.6m acres onshore have been made available for leasing by the Trump administration, far more than in any two-year period under the Obama administration. More than 153m acres of ecologically sensitive habitats – from the California desert to the Arctic national wildlife refuge – have seen conservation protections rolled back in some form. More than 280m acres have been made available for offshore leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and along nearly 90% of the US coastline. For Hoyt, the prospect of mining on formerly protected lands is a scenario almost too painful to contemplate. On a recent August afternoon, as temperatures climbed to 95F, he bumped and shuddered down a winding road at the wheel of his expedition vehicle. His destination: a lookout point, from which the Circle Cliffs, an almost incomprehensibly vast segment removed from the monument, could be viewed. Motoring through the auburn hills, he became visibly emotional. “This is where the mining trucks would be driving in and out.” The Guardian profiled three affected communities in the American west – in the Utah desert, the southern Rockies, and valleys of western Colorado – to see three different responses to this shift toward energy development. The lost monument: the future of Grand Staircase-Escalante Many longtime cattle ranchers in the area had been upset by Clinton’s move, fearing their cattle would be kicked off grazing lands. “It felt like a pretty big disrespect to us,” explains Link Chynoweth, 57, a fourth-generation rancher and alfalfa farmer. He and other ranchers welcomed Trump’s rollbacks. The monument is an archeological, paleontological and environmental wonder, and its special new status brought change: tourists, new businesses and outdoor enthusiasts searching for a slice of frontier magic. While that has benefited some, it has left many others feeling ostracized. “I’ve been here all my life,” says Chynoweth. “So when environmentalists say we have to make this a monument because they have to protect it, I’m saying: ‘Who do you have to protect it from? Me?’ The message I’m getting is: if we don’t protect it, you guys will ruin it.” While cattle grazing on the monument remains a point of contention, it’s the energy industry that has environmentalists most concerned. A section removed from the monument known as the Kaiparowits Plateau sits on top of an enormous coal reserve – albeit one that may be too remote to develop. Meanwhile, a Canadian mining firm has boasted of its acquisition of the Colt Mesa, a former copper mine on land once circumscribed by the monument. In a recent draft management proposal for the monument and the now-excluded land around it, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) expressed a preference for a plan that would be the “least restrictive to energy and mineral development”. At auction land can be leased for as little as $2 an acre, but that doesn’t mean it always gets bought. Leases can also be purchased by companies simply to increase their asset portfolio, with no plans to develop it. The result is land being offered without a guarantee it will translate into more energy or other returns on investment for the American taxpayer. For Nicole Croft, the executive director of Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, the benefits of the monument are now at risk. “The monument has brought diversity,” she says. “It’s brought opportunities. It put this place on the map.” Ricki Brown, who came here more than 20 years ago, was one of the first to put the new tourist economy to the test. He built guest houses that now rent out to visitors from around the world, who enjoy sweeping views of flat-topped mesas and desert shrubs. “Basically everybody has jumped on the tourist wagon,” he says, “whereas we used to be the only ones doing it.” Blake Spalding, a Buddhist chef, opened her restaurant, Hell’s Backbone Grill, in 2000 – and has watched business flourish. “We now do in a month what we used to do in a whole year,” she says on a warm evening over a green salad and a glass of red wine. As hikers and adventure seekers file in to fill their stomachs, she insists “tourism has brought opportunities galore” beyond the food business. “You can start a guiding business. We need electricians, carpenters and janitors, too. The notion that we need an extractive industry is a lie.” To mine or not to mine: Colorado’s North Fork Valley faces a choice The closure of two key mine sites in 2013 and 2016, Elk Creek and Bowie #2, saw hundreds of coalminers laid off. Vineyards and cherry orchards now span the green valley floor, blossoming under the shadow of nearby mountains and sitting side by side with the former mines. When the BLM put 8,000 acres on the table for leasing in its December auction, it pushed people to decide what future they really wanted: bring back the energy industry, or embrace the new agricultural economy. While the majority of the lease sales were for methane gas reclamation from sealed coalmine sites, land near the Paonia Reservoir, which supplies the region’s irrigation water, would still be open to horizontal drilling for oil and gas. For the valley’s farmers, water contamination would be devastating. Alison Gannett is one of those farmers. At Holy Terror Farm, the 53-year-old grows all her own food – except for coffee, cocoa and salt – on her land and in sun-dappled greenhouses. A former professional free skier, Gannett moved to the town of Paonia 10 years ago after growing concerned about toxic drinking water near her previous home. Five years later, she developed brain cancer. “My favorite thing about the valley is to be able to grow my own food without being surrounded by toxins,” she says. Julie Bennett, too, depends on the water. She owns Skyhawk Vineyards: 35 acres of dark red pinot noir grape. When leases still loomed in late summer, Bennett was in the middle of making cherry wine she planned to sell at her new tasting room and cafe. “Water is the key to our success,” she says. “If an accident were to happen that diminished water quality, we would be out of business.” Tom Huerkamp has lived in the county for 51 years, with a front row seat to its economic transformation. “Do you know how many coalmines have closed in Delta county?” he asks. “Twenty-seven.” Huerkamp isn’t against change – he’s invested in solar energy himself. But as the board vice-president of Delta County Economic Development, he worries organic farming alone won’t be enough to make up for lost jobs. “As a community, instead of just digging our damn heels in, we need to talk to each other, objectively, without all of this emotional crap that goes in,” he says. But for Gerren Anderson, a former North Fork coalminer, fossil fuels aren’t the answer. Anderson was laid off in 2015 when the Bowie #2 mine closed and today lives on disability benefit. The decades underground left him with black lung, chronic bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. “I don’t have any regrets,” he says. “I had a good career. I raised my family. I knew the risks. I just ran the machine longer than anybody else should.” Though many of his co-workers went into oil and gas after the mine closures, Anderson says he doesn’t support drilling in his own backyard. “I’m a hunter and a fisher, so I like to see our landscape the way it is.” Faced with the chance to welcome back the industry that once sustained it, the North Fork seems to be imagining a different future. A proposed 20,000-acre sale was successfully defeated in 2012, prompting local residents to develop their own, citizen-driven management plan for how they would like to see the valley used. In November, the North Fork tasted victory when the 8,000 acres were taken off the table: the BLM said it would defer all the leases in the valley until the completion of its Uncompahgre Resource Management Plan, which will guide management of the region’s public lands for the next 20 years. “People no longer see the future of this valley as tied to extractive industries,” says the environmental activist Pete Kolbenschlag , who campaigned against the proposed leases. “And we’re smart and sophisticated enough that we know what economic future we want for ourselves.” ‘The area is sacred’: Native American resistance in the Great Sand Dunes But a proposal to lease the mineral rights beneath their land – rights owned by the federal government – prompted a national outcry. Leases would have fallen within a mile of the park and Mt Blanca (Sisnaajiní in the Navajo language), a mountain so sacred it appears on the Navajo Nation flag. “The mountains are very symbolic,” explains Daniel Tso, a member of the Navajo Nation and a grassroots activist. “They are the real leaders who hold this land. Since time immemorial, they haven’t moved or been shaken.” Many saw echoes here of the energy industry’s longstanding encroachments on Native American lands – from the extraordinary Standing Rock reservation protests over the Dakota Access pipeline to the Havasupai tribe’s tireless resistance to uranium mining in the Grand Canyon. Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the energy lobbying group Western Energy Alliance, counters that “our modern lifestyle would not exist without oil and gas”. On a table in her glass-walled office in downtown Denver, golf caps, T-shirts and stickers bear the motto “Keep Calm and Frack On”. “We can all wish there was some other source of energy,” she says, “but the reality is that it’s keeping us safe, gives you clean water, heats your home, gets you where you need to go.” Across the mountain ridge from Great Sand Dunes, Bill Dixon runs a shop crammed with books, saddles, jackets and jewelry. Traveling indigenous groups often stop by while paying homage to the mountains, Dixon says. “The whole area is all sacred.” A member of the Menominee Indian tribe of Wisconsin, Dixon has lived here for the past 16 years. “This isn’t a town full of millionaires,” he says. “This is a town full of people who came here for quality of life. We came here for the clean air, the clean water, the lifestyle, the nature.” Like others in the valley, he worries that oil and gas development would affect the local water supply. “If they were to be fracking out there, they’d probably end up polluting the aquifer. I don’t see how they wouldn’t. We got the mountain in between us, so we might be safe, but I can’t be sure.” Ahead of the proposed recent lease sale, the local resistance mobilized. Organizers gathered and submitted public comments to the BLM. They staged a three-day campout at the proposed drilling site. They even organized a flight over the region to educate public officials about what was at stake. Christine Canaly, the director of the San Luis Valley Ecosystem Council, helped lead the effort. “We’re in the most remote part of the southern Rockies,” she said. “What are we going to do? Populate it with oil and gas drilling? That’s the antithesis of why this area has remained intact.” Their bid worked. The BLM has since agreed to delay lease proceedings to allow time to consult with the Navajo Nation. A date for consultation has not been set but, for now, the land is off limits. In the second week of December, the BLM will hold its final public lands auction of the year. More than 293,000 acres across Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming will be on the block. Meanwhile, environmental groups are preparing for two more years of resistance. “We accept some energy development will occur, but it has to be in the right places. There’s room for multiple uses,” said Nada Culver, the senior counsel at the Wilderness Society. “But this administration seems to only see room for one kind of use: developing fossil fuels at the expense of everything else, especially conservation.” All aerial photography by Bruce Gordon, courtesy of Bruce Gordon and EcoFlight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/21/whitefish-energy-company-halts-work-to-restore-puerto-ricos-power-over-unpaid-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T04:30:18Z","webTitle":"Whitefish energy company halts work to restore Puerto Rico's power over unpaid bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/whitefish-energy-company-halts-work-to-restore-puerto-ricos-power-over-unpaid-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/21/whitefish-energy-company-halts-work-to-restore-puerto-ricos-power-over-unpaid-bill","fields":{"headline":"Whitefish energy company halts work to restore Puerto Rico's power over unpaid bill","bodyText":"Whitefish Energy Holdings has said it is halting work on restoring power in Puerto Rico because it has not been paid by the US territory’s government. The company said late Monday that invoices for work done in October were outstanding and that it could no longer keep working. A letter sent to Puerto Rico officials stated the government owed Whitefish more than $83m. CEO Andy Techmanski told CNN, which first reported the news: “We stopped because of the financial situation and lack of payment with [the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa] has gotten beyond its maximum threshold of what we can sustain as a business. The exit plan is to try to get payment out of Prepa so we can continue to work for the last 10 days of our contract. “We took a huge leap of faith in coming here when others were very doubtful or scared to come because of the bankruptcy issues with the island and Prepa,” Techmanski said. “We came here to try to do something positive for the people of Puerto Rico.” Prepa said that pending payments had been halted after a Whitefish subcontractor contacted the authority requesting the stoppage because Whitefish owed them money. “Faced with this claim, Prepa had to stop the pending payments to Whitefish until the situation with the Whitefish subcontractor is clarified,” its statement read. The authority also said both sides were in talks to reach an agreement that would satisfy everyone involved. On Monday, Bill Clinton met with those left homeless by September’s category 4 storm and arrived with medical supplies and solar energy equipment donated by the Clinton Foundation, which has already shipped 76 tons of such aid. Governor Ricardo Rosselló said Clinton’s visit would help people realize that Puerto Rico still needed relief. “It’s important to have him here because he has a vision of how to emerge from the emergency phase, establish normalcy and begin to rebuild,” he said. The power dispute comes nearly a month after Rosselló’s administration canceled a $300m contract with Whitefish that is undergoing a local and federal audit. The contract had drawn scrutiny after the small Montana company – which at the time employed two people – won the contract to restore the island’s power system following Hurricane Maria. Federal committees have been trying to investigate how the contract was awarded to Whitefish, which is based in the home town of Donald Trump’s interior secretary, former congressman Ryan Zinke. The secretary has said that after the contract was awarded, he was in contact with Whitefish, and that his son had had an internship with the company. In October, Zinke criticised “dishonest media”, adding that “only in elitist Washington DC would being from a small town be considered a crime.” He denied any knowledge of or influence over the deal. The White House has also denied any impropriety. When asked by the CNN interviewer if he would do this again, Techmanksi paused and replied: “I would, I would do a lot of things different.” “I would probably get paid a lot more up front to cover the risks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/31/2017-is-so-far-the-second-hottest-year-on-record-thanks-to-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-31T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"2017 is so far the second-hottest year on record thanks to global warming | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/31/2017-is-so-far-the-second-hottest-year-on-record-thanks-to-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/31/2017-is-so-far-the-second-hottest-year-on-record-thanks-to-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"2017 is so far the second-hottest year on record thanks to global warming","bodyText":"With the first six months of 2017 in the books, average global surface temperatures so far this year are 0.94°C above the 1950–1980 average, according to NASA. That makes 2017 the second-hottest first six calendar months on record, behind only 2016. That’s remarkable because 2017 hasn’t had the warming influence of an El Niño event. El Niños bring warm ocean water to the surface, temporarily causing average global surface temperatures to rise. 2016 – including the first six months of the year – was influenced by one of the strongest El Niño events on record. Reality has debunked the ‘warming stopped’ myth For a long time one of the favorite climate denier myths involved claiming that we hadn’t seen any global surface warming since 1998. That myth has fallen by the wayside since 2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the global surface temperature records previously set in 2010 and 2005 (which were also both hotter than 1998). Yet the myth persisted for years because 1998 was anomalously hot due to the monster El Niño event that year, which meant that global temperatures weren’t much hotter than 1998 until 2014 to today. Now the first six months of 2017 have been 0.3°C hotter than 1998, despite the former having no El Niño warming influence and the latter being amplified by a monster El Niño. In 1998, there was also more solar energy reaching Earth than there has been in 2017. In terms of El Niño and solar temperature influences, 2017 thus far has been most similar to 2006, but 2017 has been 0.3°C hotter than 2006 as well. No, Rick Perry, the oceans aren’t to blame In a recent Senate committee hearing, Trump’s Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that he didn’t believe human carbon pollution is the primary control knob for the Earth’s climate (it is; hence the title of this NASA paper published in the journal Science in 2010), but instead placed most of the blame on “naturally occurring events – the warming and the cooling of our ocean waters.” That’s a simple hypothesis to test. If global surface temperatures were rising due to an exchange of heat from ocean cycles, then as Perry noted, ocean temperatures would be alternatively warming and cooling. When oceans transferred heat to the surface, their temperatures would cool, and vice-versa. That’s simply not happening – measurements show that the oceans have steadily built up heat: Instead, every component of the Earth’s climate is warming. Surface air temperatures, lower atmospheric temperatures, ocean temperatures, and sea levels are rising as ice around the globe melts. That’s a key signature not of an internal Earth cycle, but of an external influence – either an increase in incoming energy from the sun, or a decrease in outgoing energy, for example due to an increase in the heat-trapping greenhouse effect. And as we’ve established, there’s actually been a slight decrease in incoming solar energy. The culprit is quite clearly human carbon pollution. That’s how the first six months of 2017, despite lacking solar or El Niño ocean warming, can be hotter than 1998, and 2006, and every year before 2016. In fact, research has shown that global surface temperatures are already rising about 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change, during the transition in and out of ice ages. And unless we take serious action to cut carbon pollution, that rate will rise to perhaps 50 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change. Climate deniers have recently been shifting to the ‘global warming isn’t bad’ myth. It should go without saying that such rapid climate change is dangerous. Species can only adapt so fast. The IPCC concluded that we’re already approaching the point at which up to 30% of global species are at increasing risk of extinction. If we don’t take action to curb global warming, the IPCC projects that by century’s end, 40% or more of global species could go extinct, as we approach Earth’s sixth mass extinction. Today’s remarkably hot temperatures, caused by human carbon pollution, are a sign of what’s to come. If we don’t get global warming under control, the consequences will indeed be bad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Creation history: brilliant ideas build on the past | David Eagleman and Anthony Brandt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","fields":{"headline":"Creation history: brilliant ideas build on the past","bodyText":"To understand one of the secrets of creativity, just peek into an art classroom in Denver, Colorado. The teacher asks her pupils to imitate the style of Vassily Kandinsky. The students mimic Kandinsky’s geometric abstractions, mastering brushwork and learning colour theory. If that was all there were to the lesson, it would be a hands-on class in art history. But the art teacher asks the students to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces. They have all started with the same source, but their works all end up looking extremely different: some rise straight up in a column, while others are a jigsaw of different forms and angles. The students learn to treat the past not as a landing point, but as a launching pad. Creativity does not emerge out of thin air. Instead, it is a process of derivation and extrapolation. No idea is ever wholly original; there is always a link from the known to the new. We rely on culture to provide us with a storehouse of raw materials which we then transform. Each generation adds another layer to the cliffside of history. One of the keys to fostering inventiveness is not to treat the past as sacred. Artists and musicians sometimes earn reputations as provocateurs for their irreverent treatment of history – but they are actually doing what is necessary: putting culture on to the workbench and remodelling it. Beethoven didn’t write symphonies because he thought there was anything wrong with Mozart’s. Picasso didn’t paint variations on canvases by Velásquez and Manet because he rejected the old masters, but rather because he revered them. While we sometimes tinker with the imperfect, we also remake what we love, showing our admiration for the past by passing down its DNA. Sometimes inventors attempt to cover their tracks. Stravinsky denied that The Rite of Spring, his revolutionary ballet about pagan Russia, included any actual folk tunes, but scholars found a volume of them in his library after his death. It took Apple seven years to acknowledge that the iPod was based on schematics created by inventor Kane Kramer two decades earlier. But whether it’s obvious or obscured, new ideas always have a family tree. Creative minds always start from a precedent and move from there, but how far should they go? The challenge is that staying too close to the familiar can dissatisfy, while wandering too far can fail to find followers. As a result, inventive people cover the spectrum from the incremental to the disruptive. Thomas Edison made small changes to the telephone, dramatically improved the lightbulb – and at the far end imagined underwater cities powered by solar energy. The designer Norman Bel Geddes designed a host of practical products, such as cocktail shakers and furniture – but he also ranged much further, sketching flying cars and houses in which the walls rose up into the ceiling like garage doors. Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations illustrate the same principle of covering the spectrum from familiar to novel: the first few variations stay recognisably close to what’s come before, and then Beethoven gradually drifts further away until we barely recognise the theme any more. The DNA of the original is still there, but by the end it has evolved to something new. Each of us is creating our own variations on themes passed down to us. We’re at our most inventive when we summon history not to limit our imaginations, but to launch them. That’s a lesson that can start young – and that never ages.

Each day, more than 8 million people drive to work or study – about 78% of all Australians aged over 18 – and three-quarters of all vehicles carry just one person. Worryingly, our cars collectively belch out damaging greenhouse gases at levels roughly the same per year to Queensland’s entire coal and gas-fired electricity supply. Transport is Australia’s third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, with emissions from transport increasing nearly 60% since 1990, more than any other sector, according to the Climate Council. To halt that trend, we must start choosing smarter and more energy efficient modes of getting from A to B. Use cars sparingly and consider low-emissions vehicles A major solution is to simply drive less, but sometimes that’s not practical and, in rural and regional areas, may even prove impossible. So the type of car used can make a difference. Diesel engines have been hailed as a more sustainable option, as they typically deliver up to 40% better fuel efficiency than petrol, which equals less CO2 emissions. But such engines perform best when towing and driving long-distances. For stop-start city driving, which tends to clog diesel exhaust filtration systems, a small and fuel-efficient petrol engine may prove better. Or – if cash is less of an issue – purchase a hybrid car, which uses a combination of battery technology and a smaller petrol engine. Electric cars, too, are slowly entering the Australian market, but owners must be cautious to charge their vehicles from sustainable sources, rather than coal-fired power sources. To help consumers choose more efficient vehicles, the Australian government-backed Green Vehicle Guide rates cars dating back to 2004 using a colour-coded CO2 emissions meter. Consider joining a car-sharing scheme Already embraced in some European cities, car sharing remains something of a fledgling concept in Australia; most schemes are as yet only available in major capital cities. Yet the concept is promising for short distance city travel: avoid the cost and emissions of owning your own car and instead book from a share fleet only when needed, helping reduce road and carpark congestion – and proving cheaper than taxis and Uber. The City of Sydney has been most proactive in promoting such systems, with about 20% of Sydneysiders now belonging to car-share schemes. The Sydney share fleet alone has taken about 10,000 cars off the road, according to a 2016 report. Consumers can essentially choose from three systems. Companies such as GoGet, Flexicar, GreenShareCar and Student Car Share allow members to book cars from a fleet, usually by the hour or day. Peer-to-peer systems, such as Car Next Door and DriveMyCar operate more like Airbnb – you’re basically renting out your neighbour’s car. Community car-pooling schemes, while still few and far between, are another option. “Car share users get direct personal benefits because they save on transport costs,” says Car Next Door co-founder Will Davies. “They also use public transport and walk and bike more often, which brings more physical activity into their day-to-day lives.” Car Next Door offsets its carbon emissions through non-profit Greenfleet; the scheme’s 60,000 members have helped plant 12,500 trees since 2013. Switch to public transport as much as possible Only 16% of Australians aged over 18 use public transport – many who don’t often say they find services inconvenient and unreliable, or they simply don’t have access to a service at all. While the system can be frustrating in Australia, choosing public transport where possible is doubly beneficial: buses and trains have a far lower environmental impact, and services often improve as patronage increases. Rail transport, especially, is one of the world’s most energy efficient modes of getting around, producing up to five times less greenhouse gases per passenger kilometre than cars. “Many public transport systems around the world, and some in Australia, are switching to 100% renewable energy – cutting pollution even further,” says Petra Stock, Climate Council’s energy and climate systems analyst. A third of Brisbane’s bus fleet runs on compressed natural gas, while Canberra last August began trialling two new electric buses and one hybrid, and may eventually replace the entire fleet. In Adelaide, the council’s electric solar bus Tindo is the world’s first to be recharged using 100% solar energy. Choose the best option: cycling and walking It’s a no-brainer: burning our personal energy rather than fossil fuels is the most sustainable way to get around – and good for our health and hip pockets, too. But few Australians regularly choose active travel, with just one in 26 people usually walking or cycling to work or study. Again, the sheer size of our country is partly to blame. But for city dwellers and those who live close to work, active transport is attractive when the maths is considered. “Owning and operating a car costs about $225 per week, not including parking,” the Bicycle Queensland chief executive, Anne Savage, says. “Riding 10km to and from work regularly will save the average household at least $1,700 per year in transport costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 tonnes annually.” Plus riding to work can dramatically lower the risk of heart disease and cancer, Savage says. These days, one doesn’t even need to own a bike. Sharing schemes such as Reddy Go, oBike, ofo and mobike all operate via mobile phone apps, while many major cities also offer local sharing systems. And if puffing up hills puts you off, consider electric bikes (ideally if you have solar power at home for recharging). Going carless won’t always be possible, but considering more sustainable modes of transport can make a big difference.

Look around any urban centre and you’ll see the built environment itself exacerbates summer temperatures. Vehicles stuck in traffic emitting heat. Airconditioners pumping waste heat into the air. Concrete and asphalt across almost every surface, absorbing and radiating the sun’s rays. Urban canyons formed between tall buildings, trapping heat at the street level. All these factors contribute towards a phenomenon called the “urban heat island” effect, which results in cities being up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside. How do we to tackle this? A typical response on a hot day might be to turn up the aircon. But this fuels a vicious circle of heating the outdoors to cool the indoors, making external spaces more uncomfortable still, and at a significant cost. Airconditioning currently accounts for around one-fifth of building-related global electricity usage, or 2.5 timesthe total electricity use in Africa. A thermal imaging photograph of Sydney shows high surface temperatures of asphalt roads and buildings, with lower temperatures in the shade With a warming climate and rapid population growth in hotter, increasingly wealthy countries, our use of airconditioning is set to skyrocket in what the International Energy Agency calls a “looming cold crunch”. They estimate that the energy needed for cooling buildings will triple by 2050 – a growth equivalent to the current electricity demand in the USA and Germany combined. Yet our disproportionately warm cities do not simply pose an energy challenge. Ultimately, urban temperature presents us with life-or-death situations; an increase in mortality and strokes is reported when temperatures head above 25C. In the US heatwaves kill more people on average than any other natural disaster, while in the UK heat-related deaths are set to increase 257% by 2050 and 535% by 2080. And it is not just an issue in hot countries – in Moscow an estimated 11,000 people died due to a heatwave in 2010. The Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world With the frequency and intensity of heatwaves increasing we need to urgently tackle the excess heat we face both inside our buildings, and in our cities’ outside spaces. Fortunately, there are many ways in which we can mitigate the urban heat island effect – while also creating more attractive places to live, work and play. Gardens in the sky As is obvious to anyone who has sat under a tree on a hot day, vegetation can be a powerful tool in the fight against excessive city heat. Not only does greenery provide shade, it stimulates evapotranspiration, the process by which water evaporating from plants’ leaves reduces the adjacent air temperature. Many cities recognise the value of parks and trees for urban cooling, not to mention residents’ psychological wellbeing, but few have embraced greenery to the extent of Singapore. The city-state embarked on its ambitious “garden city” plan in 1967 through intensive tree-planting and the creation of new parks. As the population grew and buildings got taller, the focus shifted to include skyrise greenery encompassing “skygardens”, vertical planting and green roofs. Today Singapore accommodates 100 hectares (240 acres) of skyrise greenery, with plans to increase this to 200 ha by 2030 – an area equivalent to Regent’s Park. This growth is fuelled by building regulations such as the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (Lush) policy. Lush requires any new building to include areas of greenery equivalent to the size of the development site. These can be at ground level or at height, and often include luxuriantly planted balconies, shaded skygardens and vertical green walls – which can help cause temperatures to drop by 2-3ºC. Green buildings in Singapore Many new buildings go far beyond the minimum required. The Oasia Hotel, designed by WOHA Architects, accommodates greenery across virtually every surface. Wrapped in a dramatic 200m-tall planted trellis, the building almost drips with vegetation, and is wildly at odds with the corporate steel and glass of many urban structures. “We’ve almost created, in some ways, the notion of a huge tree in the city,” says Wong Mun Summ, Founding Director at WOHA. “[It’s] a device in the city that really supports a thriving eco-system three-dimensionally in a very dense environment.” The result is a building that accommodates greenery equivalent to 11 times its own footprint. As well as cooling, such abundant vegetation contributes many other benefits too – absorbing pollutants from the air, producing oxygen and creating a calming, natural setting within the hyper-dense city. Reflective roofs If we are to make cities cooler we must also change the materials they’re built from. Urban areas are dominated by dark and hard materials – concrete, asphalt, paving – most of which absorb, rather than reflect, solar radiation. According to Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living, conventional paving can reach temperatures up to 67C and conventional roofs up to 50–90C on a hot day. Such temperatures can have significant health impacts. According to Arthur Rosenfeld of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, living on the top floor of a building with a dark roof was identified as a risk factor of mortality in the 1995 heatwave in Chicago. “Government has a role to ban or phase out the use of black or dark roofs, at least in warm climates, because they pose a large negative health risk,” he said. The best way to overcome this is to use cool coatings– typically lighter pigments in asphalt or white-coloured coatings applied to roads, roofs and facades, which reflect more solar energy away from the city. Trials of a reflective road coating in Los Angeles The New York Cools Roofs initiative, for example, has seen more than 500,000m² of roof space covered in a white reflective coating, saving an estimated 2,282 tonnes of CO2 per year from cooling emissions. Cool roofs are installed at no cost in public buildings, for non-profit organisations and in affordable housing. In other buildings free labour for installation is offered by the city with the owner just paying for the materials. It may sound simple, but the results can be significant – research by Nasa has suggested a white roof could be 23C (42F) cooler than a typical black roof on the hottest day of the New York summer. In Los Angeles, it’s roads, not roofs, that arethe challenge. More than 10% of the city’s land area is black asphalt, which absorbs up to 95% of the sun’s energy, contributing to the urban heat island. The city is responding by painting roads in a white-coloured sealant with a high reflectivity, at a cost of $40,000 per mile. Initial measurements suggest a reduction in temperature of 10-15ºF, though one road was found to be as much as 23F cooler after painting. Water: a tool to cool Water has been used as a tool to cool cities for centuries. The 14th century palace of Alhambra, for example, housed courtyards with pools and arching fountains, stimulating the evaporation of water and cooling the hot, dry Andalusian air. The contemporary heat-proof city could follow suit, accommodating ponds, pools, fountains, sprinklers and misting systems to cool outdoor spaces. Chongqing is known as one of the “three furnaces” of the Yangtze River Delta, given its long hot summers. To provide moments of relief, the city is experimenting by using water misters at local bus stops. These spray clouds of water chilled to 5-7C, cooling the air as well as the waiting passengers. Combining water with other urban cooling strategies can yield significant temperature reductions. The University of New South Wales, the CRCLCL and Sydney Water studied the urban heat island effect in western Sydney, where temperatures can often be 6–10C hotter than the coastal regions of the city little more than 15 miles away and found that adding water features and cool coatings would reduce cooling requirements by 29–43% and lower the overall average air temperature by 1.5C. Temperatures taken adjacent to water features were up to 10C lower, the study found. Dynamic shades One of the challenges in keeping the built environment cool is overreliance on fully-glazed facades. Many windows permit desirable natural light and views but can mean buildings trap unwanted heat in summer and don’t retain it in winter. We can easily design shading systems to protect buildings from the sun, but for the best possible results, these shading systems need to move in tune with the local weather and the path of the sun. A radical example is in Abu Dhabi, where summer temperatures rise as high as 48C and buildings need to be shielded from the harsh desert sun. The Al Bahr Towers take inspiration from a Middle Eastern shading device known as a mashrabiya. Historically, these are wooden screens, patterned with Islamic geometry to allow for filtered light and views while protecting inhabitants from the intensity of the sun. But the modern mashrabiya in the Al Bahr Towers move to create a dramatic, adaptable façade, estimated to reduce the building’s CO2 emissions by 20%. The exterior of Al Bahr towers in Abu Dhabi A building management system operates 1,049 hexagon-shaped shades, opening and closing them like flowers. Their movements follow the sun, shading the parts of the building in direct sunlight but opening up to allow for natural light as the sun moves by. The result is a constantly changing and adapting façade, one that reflects daily and seasonal patterns of weather, climate and occupation and responds to changing needs of heat and light. Adaptable buildings and infrastructure like this one, which can morph to respond to different seasons and weather events, will be crucial in the future battle to keep cool and comfortable in a warming climate.

However, on average these outages represent a much smaller quantity of lost generation compared to the day-to-day intermittency of wind or solar. Nuclear plants spend a high proportion of the time generating at their maximum capacity. On emissions, some proponents of both nuclear and renewables do fall into the habit of referring to their technologies as “zero-carbon”, even though there are some greenhouse gas emissions produced with all forms of generation. But there is remarkable academic agreement that the emissions from nuclear, wind, solar and many other non-fossil generation sources are similarly low per unit of electricity generated and these emissions are tiny fractions of those associated with burning coal and gas. We desperately need to cut emissions in our electricity mix to as low as possible. The nuclear industry’s Harmony programme has a goal of 25% of the world’s electricity being supplied by nuclear energy by 2050. The remaining 75% would need to be supplied by a broad mix of other almost zero-carbon generation options, alongside energy storage and smart grids to help deal with intermittent generation and variable demand. We should work together for a strong, clean future for electricity generation rather than quibble while coal burns. Agneta Rising Director general, World Nuclear Association • The simple engineering facts that solar only functions less than one-third of the day and wind only functions when winds are just right mean that they are unreliable and must be backed up at a moment’s notice. In most areas, that’s by burning gas in low-efficiency “peaker” turbine plants that never get shut off fully to protect their expensive equipment. So, wind/solar energy is far from free, has high related emissions and is far more expensive than a nuclear plant that runs 90% of every year for decades. Nuclear power provides far better capacity, stability, longevity and jobs than can wind/solar enterprises, all while providing local communities with reliable power and great economic benefit to boot. The combustion industry loves renewables because their use commits poorly informed electorates and legislatures to installing emissions-producing backup.

The most obvious would be to pursue the following line: hit hard by the effects of climate change, the world can save itself by building a sustainable future in renewable technology. It’s also a message that falls squarely in the tell-us-something-we-don’t-know box. Many moons have passed – and much discussion has transpired – since Al Gore brought us the world’s first blockbuster powerpoint presentation, 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth. That film ended with what is now considered a cliché in environmental documentaries: a “what can I do to help?” section intended to turn audiences into campaigners. For her Sundance-supported feature documentary debut Catching the Sun, which screens in Australia as part of environmental documentary film festival Transitions this month, film-maker and activist Shalini Kantayya took a different route. She framed the discussion not as a “world gone to hell” prophecy of doom but as the means to argue renewable tech is – or can be – all about the economy, stupid. The film begins in Richmond, Virginia, a place that acts as a symbolic stand-in for any number of other American cities. The manufacturing industry, long its backbone, has withered and unemployment is rife. A program called Solar Richmond creates “green-job opportunities”. It equips citizens, often those from rough-and-tumble neighbourhoods, with skills necessary for employment in solar panel installation. As one interviewee puts it: “You can’t talk in a neighbourhood like this about saving the polar bear. They’re not gonna feel ya.” What they can feel is the difference between being trained and ready for employment and living on welfare. This is where Kantayya starts – the issue of job creation – viewing the word “renewable” in both an environmental and economic context. “When I went to the Solar Richmond training program, I thought this is a symbol for the kind of transformation all cities must make if we’re going to move our global economy towards a renewable future,” she says. “I really got excited with that idea, which is really about the economics. Could solar do for America what the automotive industry did?” Catching the Sun largely ignores the kinds of discussion about climate change synonymous with binary politics, and is intended for intelligent audiences who don’t need to be convinced about the environmental benefits of clean energy. It has already screened in front of people for whom its messages about financial opportunity could make an impact – including at COP21 and for 100 mayors from around the world, at the invitation of the US secretary of state, John Kerry. “One of the most moving things about the film is that it is actually reaching policymakers,” says Kantayya. “Solar energy isn’t just good for the polar bears, it’s good for the middle class and the working class,” says the director. “I found in the many years making this film that there’s a story that’s not been told – that solar energy is the foremost economic opportunity of our time.” One interesting case study is staunch conservative Debbie Dooley, one of the founding members of the US’s Tea Party and a participant in the documentary. She is also an outspoken advocate for solar energy. This may be generally perceived as a left-leaning cause, but Dooley is adamant her passion for solar is because of her ideological beliefs, not despite them. Kantayya says her and Dooley’s political opinions are diametrically opposed (“We don’t talk about any other issues, let’s be clear,” she says, chuckling). But she views their collaboration as representative of the potential to break down barriers. “I think our friendship is a symbol of what can be possible when we push our differences aside – this labelling of left and right – and say: what is it that we actually both want? “Arguably the most environmental president [the US] has ever had was Richard Nixon. He gave us the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. All of those things were signed under Nixon and you can hardly call him a granola hippy.” Catching the Sun arrives at an interesting time in Australia. Freed from the weird cheerleading of Tony “Coal is good for humanity” Abbott, there is a sense that a corner has been turned. In January, two new solar plants (now the largest in the country) were formally opened in Nyngan and Broken Hill, prompting speculation they may signal the “the birth of large-scale solar”. The Asia-Pacific manager for First Solar, which partnered with AGL, said costs for large-scale solar have fallen about 30% in recent years. Uptake for individual homes and offices remains high, with recent data revealing more than 1.5m Australian homes have rooftop solar panels. And last month an Australian family became the first in the country to get a Tesla Powerwall unit installed. But the danger is that political seesawing and changes in policy will stymie growth. Recently in Nevada, for example, thousands of workers were let go after the state’s energy commission passed rules that roll back solar incentives. Similarly energy campaigners in the UK blamed government policy for the collapse of two solar panel installers last year. Kantayya reiterates the message that governments should “send strong signals to the business community” and believes root-and-branch reform has to be a part of it: “The rewiring of our energy system is also going to involve the rewiring of our political system.” She singles out Germany’s feed-in tariff, which pays individual people to be power producers, as an example of an effective initiative. “A large portion of the solar that came to Germany was actually owned by ordinary people. Industrialists were almost left out of Germany’s solar revolution.” Catching the Sun does, by the way, end with that eco-activist doco cliché: a call-to-action imploring audiences to contact their elected officials. But the film is so logically argued, and advocates such highly pragmatic workable solutions, you can hardly fault it for doing so. “Of course we need to make big federal changes but it is about ordinary citizens going to their local government, going to their state governments, and saying this is what we want.” • Catching the Sun is part of Transitions Film festival. The festival is on at Cinema Nova in Melbourne from 18 February to 3 March and at Mercury Cinema in Adelaide from 20 to 29 May"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/16/texas-town-georgetown-energy-green","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T11:49:55Z","webTitle":"This is what America's eco city of the future looks like","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/16/texas-town-georgetown-energy-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/16/texas-town-georgetown-energy-green","fields":{"headline":"This is what America's eco city of the future looks like","bodyText":"When the caller said he worked for Harry Reid and the former Senate majority leader wanted a word, Dale Ross assumed it was a joke. “OK, which of my buddies are messing with me today?” he wondered. He shouldn’t have been so surprised. Ross is the mayor of Georgetown, population 65,000, and he has become a minor celebrity in environmental circles as a result of a pioneering decision in 2015 to get all the city’s electricity from renewable sources. Georgetown’s location in oil-and-gas-centric Texas and Ross’s politics add to the strangeness of the tale. The mayor is a staunch Republican at a time when a Republican president – and his Environmental Protection Agency administrator – reject the scientific consensus on climate change and are trying to revive the declining coal industry. Ross has appeared in a National Geographic documentary, a forthcoming film about clean energy for HBO directed by James Redford (son of Robert) and in this year’s follow-up to An Inconvenient Truth, which saw the advocate and former vice-president Al Gore visit Georgetown. The day after we met at city hall, just off Georgetown’s charming main square, Ross was set to fly to Utah to introduce a screening of An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. Then it was on to Las Vegas to reunite with Gore, a fellow speaker at Friday’s National Clean Energy Summit, an event co-hosted by Reid, a Democrat from Nevada. Next week, a conference in Oakland, California. Next month, a green energy panel in Nova Scotia. “You should see the fan mail that I get, especially with the movies,” Ross grinned. The 58-year-old said the decision to follow the lead of Burlington, Vermont – the first US city to run solely on renewable energy – was not the product of liberal do-gooder vapours wafting up Interstate 35 from nearby Austin. It was based on cold-eyed pragmatism, the fruit of the kind of careful numerical analysis he performs in his day job as a certified public accountant. “The revolution is here,” he said. “And I’m a good little Republican, a rightwing fiscal conservative, but when it comes to making decisions based on facts, that’s what we do.” The facts, Ross said, are that when Georgetown negotiated power supply deals the cost was about the same between natural gas and wind and solar, but the natural gas option would provide only a seven-year guaranteed contract whereas 20-25 year proposals were on the table from renewable providers. Georgetown officials decided to lock in a long-term rate to eliminate price volatility, mindful of the risk that future government actions might send fossil fuel costs soaring. Prices in the city, Ross said, have declined from 11.4¢ per kilowatt hour in 2008 to 8.5¢ this year. Georgetown sources most of its power from a wind farm 500 miles away in Amarillo and will get solar energy from a farm in west Texas that is expected to be finished next June, meaning the city can attain its 100% renewable goal even when the wind isn’t blowing. This year, Ross said, the tally is about 90%, down from 100% in 2016. “I think it’s a big step for Texas, for Georgetown,” said Christian Soeffker, who runs a toy shop on the square. “We just like the idea of being in a town that is in some ways special because we’ve got all that green energy.” Georgetown makes headlines not only because so few US cities run entirely on renewables, but because it has a conservative mayor willing to make compromises and fraternise with high-profile Democrats in a hyper-partisan era where climate change is one of the most divisive subjects. “How is anybody going to compete with wind and solar?” said Ross, who has ordered an electric-powered BMW scooter from California and plans to fit solar panels at his home and office. All the same, he voted for coal’s biggest champion in last November’s presidential election – Trump was “like, my eighth or ninth choice” in the primary, he said – and went to his inauguration, which he said was “phenomenal”, even if it cost $700 for a basic hotel room. His support is not unquestioning, though. “When Trump was campaigning he was talking about clean coal and we’re going to bring coal jobs back? That is a mirage, that is not going to happen,” he said. “Coal is one of the most expensive forms of fossil fuels to produce. And those jobs are never going to come back, ever. They’re done.” As for any policies the federal government might enact to boost the coal industry, such as the decision announced on Tuesday to scrap the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan? “Isn’t that sort of like putting a Band-Aid on somebody that has terminal cancer?” Ross said. “I’m not the smartest guy in the room but it’s not that complicated, OK? How’s fossil fuels going to compete in the next five years? They’re not going to be able to compete.” ‘We have so much that is ideal for solar’ Texas is the US leader in wind energy capacity, even as many of its politicians maintain absolute fealty to fossil fuels that are a key economic driver and still the supplier of most of the state’s electricity. It has lagged behind other states in solar capacity but is starting to realise its potential. “We have so much area in Texas that’s ideal for solar,” said Joey Romano, a 35-year-old with a small solar farm 50 miles west of downtown Houston. “Solar and wind, unsubsidised, today already can compete with coal,” he said. Local Sun has about 100 residential customers. Completed at the end of 2015, the farm is located in a rural county that gave Trump 79% of the vote. But Romano said local officials recognised the potential for jobs and revenue and were happy to help the project get off the ground. Beehives stand among the 15,000 panels. “We call the programme ‘farm-to-market solar energy’,” Romano said, at his office in central Houston. Local Sun is a boutique operation in partnership with MP2 Energy, a retail company owned by Shell, and it is designed to attract those willing to pay a small premium for an eco-conscious local product, much as food shoppers might spend a little more for organic groceries. However modest, its very existence feels like a significant marker in a city that is known as America’s oil and gas capital but is in fact the nation’s biggest municipal user of green power. On the other hand, environmental activists worry that solar’s growth will be stunted in Texas and across the country if, as appears likely, the Trump White House imposes prohibitive tariffs on imported solar panels. “They may harm thousands of installation jobs in favour of a few hundred manufacturing jobs, so that could hurt,” said Jim Marston of the Environmental Defense Fund, who believes renewable energy will thrive even if federal incentives end and barriers are erected. “You can’t stop the technology. It’s too good, the prices are too good, and people want it,” he said. Ross agrees that market forces will prevail. On Friday, the day of the clean energy summit, Texas’s largest electricity producer announced it would close two more coal-fuelled power plants in the state. Luminant cited challenging economic conditions including low wholesale and natural gas prices and the growth of renewables. A week earlier, the company said that in January it will retire a large coal-powered plant in east Texas. “We were on the frontier of the fossil fuel business, oil and gas,” Ross said. “And now Texas again is on the frontier of the new energy that’s going to be the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/05/donald-trump-accused-blocking-satellite-climate-change-research","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-05T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Republicans accused of obstructing satellite research into climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/donald-trump-accused-blocking-satellite-climate-change-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/05/donald-trump-accused-blocking-satellite-climate-change-research","fields":{"headline":"Republicans accused of obstructing satellite research into climate change","bodyText":"The Republican majority in the US Congress has been accused of deliberately obstructing research on global warming after it emerged that a critically important technique for investigating sea-ice cover at the poles faces being blocked. The row has erupted after a key polar satellite broke down a few days ago, leaving the US with only three ageing ones, each operating long past their shelf lives, to measure the Arctic’s dwindling ice cap. Scientists say there is no chance a new one can now be launched until 2023 or later. None of the current satellites will still be in operation then. The crisis has been worsened because the US Congress this year insisted that a backup sea-ice probe had to be dismantled because it did not want to provide funds to keep it in storage. Congress is currently under the control of Republicans, who are antagonistic to climate science and the study of global warming. “This is like throwing away the medical records of a sick patient,” said David Gallaher of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. “Our world is ailing and we have apparently decided to undermine, quite deliberately, the effectiveness of the records on which its recovery might be based. It is criminal.” The threat to the US sea-ice monitoring programme – which supplies data to scientists around the world – will trigger further accusations at this week’s international climate talks in Bonn that the Trump administration is trying to block studies of global warming for ideological reasons. Earth’s sea ice has shrunk dramatically – particularly in the Arctic – in recent years as rising emissions of greenhouse gases have warmed the planet. Satellites have been vital in assessing this loss, thanks mainly to America’s Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP), which has overseen the construction of eight F-series satellites that use microwaves sensors to monitor sea-ice coverage. These probes, which have lifespans of three to five years, have shown that millions of square kilometres of sea ice have disappeared from the Arctic over the past 20 years, allowing less solar energy to be reflected back into space – and so further increasing global temperatures – while also disrupting Inuit life and wildlife in the region. At present three ageing satellites – DMSP F16, F17 and F18 – remain in operation, though they are all beginning to drift out of their orbits over the poles. The latest satellite in the series, F19, began to suffer sensor malfunctions last year and finally broke down a few weeks ago. It should have been replaced with the F20 probe, which had already been built and was being kept in storage by the US Air Force. However it had to be destroyed, on the orders of the US Congress, on the grounds that its storage was too costly. Many scientists say this decision was made for purely ideological reasons. They also warn that many other projects for monitoring climate change, including several satellite missions, face similar threats from the Trump administration and Congress. Such losses have serious consequences, say researchers. “Sea-ice data provided by satellites is essential for initiating climate models and validating them,” said Andrew Fleming of the British Antarctic Survey. “We will be very much the poorer without that information.” The heading, standfirst and first paragraph of this article were amended on 8 November 2017 after an editing intervention erroneously accused President Donald Trump of obstructing satellite research into climate change.

We’ve heard a lot about coal this past year, particularly from President Trump. In fact, arguably the key reason that we have this cautionary Bible story in the White House was his ability to connect with mining communities during the campaign.” Oliver showed clips of Trump galvanizing voters at campaign rallies by promising to bring back coal industry jobs, putting on a hard hat, and doing a mining gesture on stage. “Let me stop you right there. It is not easy watching someone I doubt has done a day of hard labor in his life show how he thinks coal mining works,” Oliver said, before showing an interview with the EPA head, Scott Pruitt, in which he claimed 50,000 coal mining jobs had been created since Trump took office. “But Trump’s promising to bring back coal jobs is undeniably potent and, to listen to his EPA administrator, it’s a promise that he’s already keeping. “So the only problem there is that those numbers are bullshit,” Oliver quipped. “The Bureau of Labor Statistics have the actual number of coal jobs created since last year at just 1,300, so that 50,000 new jobs claims was off by 48,700. Which, for this administration, is actually uncharacteristically accurate.” Oliver went on to catalogue the administration’s efforts thus far to revive the coal industry: “There is no doubt Trump claims coal is a huge priority for his White House, and let’s set aside the fact that it is environmentally catastrophic. Which we shouldn’t, because it is, but this person clearly doesn’t care about that. We pulled out of the Paris agreement citing coal as one of the reasons. He’s lifted a freeze on new coal leases on public lands, and revoked a rule to limit coal mining companies from dumping debris into local streams. So, if coal jobs are so important to him, let’s talk about them.” Oliver explained how Bob Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, has for years been peddling the idea that Obama-era regulations were a death knell for coal jobs. “Coal mining jobs undoubtedly did decline under Obama, but it’s worth noting that coal mining jobs have also been declining for decades,” Oliver said, displaying a graph charting the rapid descent of coal industry jobs. “Just look at that trend line: coal industry jobs declined at roughly the same rate as a career in the zeppelin industry and babies named Adolf. Some still exist – there’s just not nearly as many of them anymore.” He went on: “And I’m not saying Obama’s regulations had no effect, but researchers have found that they had very little impact relative to other factors. When they studied the decline in expected demand for coal from a decade ago, they found that nearly half of that drop was owing to the drop in natural gas prices, and another 18% was due to the growth in renewable energy, like wind and solar. And there is perhaps no more dramatic evidence of coal losing out to solar energy than this.” Oliver then showed a news clip about the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum, which is estimated to have saved nearly $10,000 by using alternative energy sources: “It’s true,” he said. “The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum is now using solar energy. It’s like finding out the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame was brought to you by Smash Mouth.” Coal mining, like almost all industries, is facing increased automation,” Oliver said. “And I say that well aware that in five to 10 years, I’m probably going to be replaced by a robotic English tea kettle that screams depressing money stats at you. “Trump needs to stop lying to coal miners. We all do,” he concluded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/04/brazil-raises-hopes-of-a-retreat-from-new-mega-dam-construction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T17:56:42Z","webTitle":"Brazil raises hopes of a retreat from new mega-dam construction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/brazil-raises-hopes-of-a-retreat-from-new-mega-dam-construction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/04/brazil-raises-hopes-of-a-retreat-from-new-mega-dam-construction","fields":{"headline":"Brazil raises hopes of a retreat from new mega-dam construction","bodyText":"After swathes of forest clearance, millions of tonnes of concrete and decades of hydro-expansion, Brazil has raised hopes that it may finally step back from the construction of new mega-dams. In a surprise statement, a senior government official said hydropower policy needed to be rethought in the face of environmental concerns, indigenous sensitivities and public unease. Anti-dam activists welcomed the apparent shift, despite scepticism about the declared motives, which they believe mask a drying up of bribes from the construction industry. The decision could reprieve the Tapajos and free-flowing rivers from a plan to open half the Amazon basin to hydro-development. Brazil already gets more than 70% of its electricity from hydropower – one of the highest proportions in the world. Until recently, most of the generating capacity came from plants near the southern border and the economic hubs of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. But in recent years, the dam builders – backed by the Workers’ party administrations of Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – pushed north into the Amazon with the huge Belo Monte project on the Xingu river, despite environmental concerns, court battles and fierce resistance from indigenous residents. The Tapajos was the next major river in the sights of the consortium led by utility Eletrobras and major construction firms such as Odebrecht. Two dams have already been completed on the Teles Pires tributary and hundreds more were planned elsewhere. But the momentum has diminished along with falling government revenues, sluggish economic demand and an increasingly unpredictable climate that has made hydropower generation less reliable and more expensive. Opponents have capitalised on this. After indigenous demonstration and critical scientific studies, the environment agency rejected a licence application for a dam at São Luiz do Tapajós which would have flooded Munduruku indigenous territory. The current centre-right government of Michel Temer now appears to be considering a far bigger retreat. “We don’t hold preconceptions about big projects, but we have to respect the views of society, which has reservations about them,” said Paulo Pedrosa, the executive secretary of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, in an interview with O Globo newspaper. Government studies suggest Brazil could add 50 gigawatts of hydroenergy by 2050, but Pedrosa noted that less than a quarter of the necessary dams would be free from challenges over protected land. Pedrosa said such costs should not be hidden, an apparent reference to the Rousseff administration’s refusal to heed warnings about the Belo Monte dam, which has since proved a social and environmental disaster. The Car Wash corruption investigation exposed how the Workers’ party received campaign donations from Odebrecht in return for over-inflated contracts to build Belo Monte and other infrastructure projects. Now the kickbacks have dried up, government officials have little incentive to cover up the social and environmental costs of future projects. Few believe the Temer administration is any cleaner or greener. It is closely allied to the agribusiness lobby, which is primarily responsible for Amazon clearance. Last year, the government also attempted to open up protected areas to mining companies. But it is in the process of privisatising Eletrobras, which will mean the economic feasibility of mega-projects will come under greater scrutiny, particularly with wind and solar energy becoming more viable. The government will propose a new model for project evaluation to Congress this year that takes greater account of costs. “Current projects when priced appropriately - including transmission costs, risks associated with the seasonality of energy and the possible delay of works - show them to be much less competitive than in previous assessments,” the Ministry of Mines and Energy noted in an email response to The Guardian. It is unlikely to be a complete panacea Given the pro-business stance of the ruling coalition, there are fears that other environmental licensing criteria may be weakened. With a presidential election in October, any changes of policy could also be rapidly reversed, but anti-dam activists hold out hope this - in regard to mega-projects at least - this will be a turning point. “The Brazilian government’s announcement validates what scientists, indigenous activists and economists have long known: that these costly, corrupt hydropower projects are destroying lives, livelihoods and the vibrant ecosystem of the Amazon, the lungs of the planet,” Kate Horner, executive director of International Rivers, said. “Brazil can meet its energy needs without mega-dams, and now it will finally get the chance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/29/tsb-woes-britain-nation-tech-dunces","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Don’t let TSB’s woes convince you Britain is a nation of tech dunces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/29/tsb-woes-britain-nation-tech-dunces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/29/tsb-woes-britain-nation-tech-dunces","fields":{"headline":"Don’t let TSB’s woes convince you Britain is a nation of tech dunces","bodyText":"It was all so different for Paul Pester last December. Unveiling TSB’s new banking platform, he claimed that it had created “a more digital, agile and flexible TSB”. Before last weekend’s switch to the new system, TSB’s press office said that almost everything was running on the new platform; there was only the little matter of transferring 1.3bn account details for 5 million customers, and all would be done. Now, Pester finds himself presiding over another example of a great British IT failure. In the same week, outsourcing company Capita, which has had problems with contracts with GP surgeries and London’s congestion charge, said it was seeking a £701m rights issue as part of an overhaul that includes rebuilding its technology and IT infrastructure. Meanwhile, the government has found itself in even further trouble over the Windrush scandal due to the Home Office’s inability to digitise a set of landing cards from 70 years ago. And that’s before we talk about the stuttering, long-delayed rollout of universal credit. Is it that Britain is just bad at IT projects? You don’t have to look far to find examples at the banks: each of NatWest, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS have had “glitches” of greater or lesser impact in the past few years. BT took a big writedown on a calamitous NHS computerisation nearly a decade ago. In the private or public sector, there seems to be a record of messing up. But it’s easy to get the wrong impression. We generally don’t hear about all the projects that go right, because we just expect ATMs to serve us money, or tills to work, or unseen globe-spanning search engines to return results, or apps on our phones to open. TSB’s customers had already been using the platform behind last week’s crisis for almost everything, apart from their accounts; Sabadell, the Spanish parent of TSB, built the technology over nearly three years, building on earlier technology from Accenture. This wasn’t a rush job. However, TSB’s chiefs may have forgotten the longstanding rule of IT projects: completing the first 80% of it takes 80% of your time – and the last 20% takes another 80%. Managers who insist on hitting calendar targets probably aren’t familiar with the endless testing that computer systems and code need. To think that the UK excels at being bad at IT projects, though, is unnecessary self-flagellation. In the US, public and private mess up too: the launch of the Healthcare.gov site in 2013 was calamitously bad, with only a tiny percentage of people able to use it at first. It improved, but there were red faces all round. In September 2014, Apple pushed out a software update for the iPhone that killed its phone capability (it was quickly reverted). And Facebook, of course, allowed the personal data of more than 80 million people to be scraped from its site. The difficulty is that software, unlike a steel beam, is hard to test for use in different environments; Nasa has managed to write error-free code, but it takes years of effort for comparatively short programs. The general level of sophistication in how software is written is “in the hunter-gatherer stage”, according to one professor studying it: professional code is full of bugs which have to be fixed, which often exposes other underlying bugs. The interaction between code on different systems can be unpredictable. And meanwhile managers want it done to a budget and a date. In fact, there’s life in the IT project business. Capita says it will now focus on five outsourcing areas rather than 40; two of the survivors are software and IT outsourcing. Its results show that both had better profit margins than other divisions. Software is the future; and we aren’t that bad at it. Powerful case for UK to get on board with onshore windfarms When the UK went without coal for three days this week, it was wind turbines that provided much of the power to keep the lights on. Contrary to what the Conservative party might have you think, people like windfarms. New government polling shows support for offshore windfarms is at a record high, with 83% of the public backing them. Even onshore windfarms, which energy minister Claire Perry said the Tories had blocked because they were “just so controversial”, are now more popular than ever. For the first time, more than three-quarters of the public (76%) say they support them. Solar energy has 87% in favour. During the coal-free run, the government boasted that the UK’s “world-leading renewables” were going from strength to strength. Yet while there is more billpayer subsidy earmarked for offshore windfarms, there is still no support for solar and onshore wind power. Perry said she was now “looking carefully” at helping onshore windfarms to be built in Scotland and Wales. More offshore wind is great. The UK is reaping the rewards for its leadership there – witness GE choosing the UK to test its new 12MW turbine, the world’s most powerful. But onshore windfarms are still significantly cheaper. Research has found they could be built without consumers paying any subsidy and for the same price as new gas power plants. Big firms are lining up to say they want to build more onshore wind power. Innogy, Vattenfall, SSE and ScottishPower are among the firms keen to develop windfarms in Scotland and Wales. Unlike nuclear plants, onshore windfarms can be built quickly. Public and political debates on energy are dominated by the cost of bills, of price caps. What better time to unblock the cheapest source of green power? Beast from the east isn’t to blame for GDP slump – it’s the frozen wages It’s easy to read too much into a single set of figures, but Friday’s combination of almost zero GDP growth and rising personal insolvencies presents the British government with a gloomy economic health check. Back in 2015 there were fewer than 20,000 personal insolvencies. In the first quarter of 2018 the total reached 27,388 – which was the highest quarterly figure recorded since 2012. A fall in GDP growth from 0.4% in the last three months of 2017 to 0.1% in the first three months of 2018 was even more disturbing. This first estimate of economic output showed that the UK’s building industry is struggling and the manufacturing sector becalmed. The service industries continue to expand, especially banks in the Square Mile, but not at the pace seen at the height of the recovery in 2015. One-off factors may have played a part, though apparently not the “beast from the east” cold snap that chancellor Philip Hammond reached for as an explanation. A more convincing explanation is the damaging effect of falling real wages over the last year. Without inflation-busting pay rises, it was little surprise that household spending, for so long the heart of the economy, would start to wane. The Treasury, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has refused to give government employees and welfare recipients an income increase of any significance and continued the squeeze on departmental spending, capping its costs. Yet it has benefited from the modest rise in private-sector wages, which have boosted PAYE tax receipts, while higher prices in the shops have lifted VAT receipts. As result the budget deficit at the end of March fell to its lowest level since 2007. Labour and the unions are right to complain that this situation is unsustainable. By sapping middle- and low-income households of funds, it might boost its own finances, but it undermines the long-term strength of the British economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/05/morocco-to-give-600-mosques-a-green-makeover","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-05T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Morocco to give 600 mosques a green makeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/morocco-to-give-600-mosques-a-green-makeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/05/morocco-to-give-600-mosques-a-green-makeover","fields":{"headline":"Morocco to give 600 mosques a green makeover","bodyText":"Six hundred “green mosques” are to be created in Morocco by March 2019 in a national consciousness-raising initiative that aims to speed the country’s journey to clean energy. If all goes to plan, the green revamp will see LED lighting, solar thermal water heaters and photovoltaic systems installed in 100 mosques by the end of this year. Morocco’s ministry of Islamic affairs is underwriting the innovative scheme, paying up to 70% of the initial investment costs in a partnership with the German government. Jan-Christophe Kuntze, the project’s chief, said: “We want to raise awareness and mosques are important centres of social life in Morocco. They are a place where people exchange views about all kinds of issues including, hopefully, why renewables and energy efficiency might be a good idea.” Morocco has established itself as a regional climate leader with high-profile projects, ranging from the largest windfarm in Africa to an enormous solar power plant in the Sahara desert, which opened earlier this year. In November, Marrakech will host the COP22 climate summit to discuss preparations for implementing the Paris climate agreement. The country’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haité, told the Guardian that religion could make a powerful contribution to the clean energy debate, shortly before an Islamic declaration on climate change last year. “It is very important for Muslim countries to come back to their traditions and remind people that we are miniscule as humans before the importance of the earth,” she said. “We need to protect it, and to save humankind in the process.” The new green mosques project plans to do this with established technologies that can be adapted to public buildings and residential homes. By training electricians, technicians and auditors, it hopes to direct Morocco’s clean energy along the path followed by German’s Energiewende, (energy transition). But Kuntze stressed that Germany was offering technological support, rather than financial opportunities for its own industries. “We are not representing any German business interests at all,” he said. “The good thing about this project is that the Moroccan government came up with the idea themselves. It is something new and really innovative and it has not been tried anywhere else before, to my knowledge.” The initiative has broken new ground for gender equality in Morocco too. Many mourchidates (female clerics) have been involved in the project, as well as imams, and about a quarter of the participants in recent seminars have been women, Kuntze said. Under the project’s energy service contract model, contractors will eventually be paid by the energy savings generated from the clean power systems they install. As the renovations should cut the mosques’ electricity usage by 40%, these should be substantial. The first 100 mosques to get a green makeover are mostly based in big population centres – such as Rabat, Fez, Marrakech and Casablanca – but the project will quickly move on to smaller villages and towns. With 15,000 mosques dotted around the north African country, the idea’s growth potential is clear. The objective was to kickstart a renovations industry for sustainable companies that could employ many Moroccans in the clean energy sector, Kuntze said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/16/europes-renewable-energy-revolution-weatherwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-16T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"Europe's renewable energy revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/16/europes-renewable-energy-revolution-weatherwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/16/europes-renewable-energy-revolution-weatherwatch","fields":{"headline":"Europe's renewable energy revolution","bodyText":"More than 2km down a dark tunnel deep inside a Norwegian mountain, a drilling machine is boring out holes in the rock. It’s part of a major project that will connect Britain to Norway’s huge hydroelectric power supplies, passing power lines through the mountain near Kvilldal, southwest Norway, before laying the world’s longest undersea power cable, 450km long, to Blyth in Northumberland. It will take years to build, but when it is completed, the UK could import 1,400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 750,000 homes. It will also allow Britain to export any surplus wind energy back to Norway. This is just part of a quiet revolution in renewable energy across Europe. An international power grid is gradually developing, using power interconnectors to trade surplus energy across national electricity networks, allowing big wind power producers in northern Europe, for example, to trade electricity with large solar energy generators in southern Europe. The UK has already plugged into the network through interconnectors to Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, and there is a proposal for a highly ambitious project to connect Britain to Iceland’s abundant supply of geothermal and hydroelectric power using a subsea cable around 1,000km long. This international power grid gives more reliable supplies, helping to smooth out the intermittent power produced from renewables such as wind and solar energy. It also gives Britain more secure power sources as old nuclear and out-of-favour coal plants are shut down. In theory, it could even bring the wholesale energy price down, thanks to the increased availability of cheap renewable power generated far away from where the main energy demand centres are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/solar-energy-australia-is-not-an-innovation-nation-its-an-inertia-nation","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T23:33:10Z","webTitle":"Solar energy: Australia is not an innovation nation, it's an inertia nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/solar-energy-australia-is-not-an-innovation-nation-its-an-inertia-nation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/solar-energy-australia-is-not-an-innovation-nation-its-an-inertia-nation","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy: Australia is not an innovation nation, it's an inertia nation","bodyText":"Australia stands at a crossroads after the Paris agreement and a week of talk about being an innovation nation. This has been coming for some time and, as a successful energy entrepreneur, I think the choices facing the country could not be starker. A mate and I left Australia in 2007 to build a solar business in the United States called Sungevity, which is now selling solar systems to homes and businesses across America and Europe and holds a market value greater than that of Peabody Coal. As our business has continually strengthened, we’ve watched Australia’s solar industry lurch up and down, struggling under the curse of intermittent policy and a lack of commitment. It has affected investment (the policy seesaw was behind our decision to sell our interests in Australia to Roofjuice) and cost Australia its place as a world leader in renewable ingenuity. By comparison California, with its ambition to lead the solar game and its robust innovation culture, has thrived. We started up a business incubator, which now houses dozens of renewable energy companies. I also have the good fortune to run the California clean energy fund, which has invested in startups and entrepreneurs driving climate solutions, creating wealth and jobs and changing the world. In the US they may not like to say the dirty words “industry policy” in public, but in California they’ve still got one and it’s delivering major benefits in the new energy economy. Coming from an epicentre of the enormous changes that are disrupting energy industries globally, I have a few observations of the Australian industry following a recent trip home: Firstly, hats off to the Australian solar industry which, despite it all, pioneers the best technology in the world. At a residential level, it’s achieved some of the highest rates of solar penetration and lowest costs in the world. Thanks to those working in the sector, families are saving money on their power bills and we have great learnings for the rest of the world on how to integrate solar at scale into the electricity supply. Secondly, Australia must build on this success. The last government seemed determined to quash it but there are positive signals from the new prime minister that he understands the world is moving this way and we need to invest to keep up. While I have reservations as to whether the recently announced $1.1bn innovation plan can turn around Australia’s risk-averse business culture, at least it’s a start. Political signals are important – now we need some meat on the bone. Finally, now is the time to move quickly if Australia wants to benefit from the world’s energy shift. Australia has to wake up from the illusion that fossil fuels will be its saviour. The UK has just announced that it will be done with coal by 2025, after hundreds of years of being powered by the stuff. California, the eighth largest economy in the world, is weaning itself off coal by 2020 and has laws in place demanding that 50% of its power comes from renewables by 2030. China, in its latest plan, is going to peak its coal use in 2017. The list goes on. Australia confused delegates in Paris by talking up the opportunities of the transition to renewable energy while seeking to protect the dying coal industry. That is not an innovation nation – it’s an inertia nation. Why not spend the $4bn Australia wastes each year on fossil fuel subsidies on bolstering the renewable energy sector? There’s no market sense in skewing the playing field when the world’s committed to get off coal. There is so much talent in this country. Australia keeps punching above its weight in the world, but its brightest and most innovative minds are struggling for support. We need to lean in on our genius. Australians are legends overseas in the photovoltaic industry, for example, which will dominate energy this century. They should also be household names at home, rather than the mining moguls who are risking everything we hold dear in order to keep profiteering. South Australian business Infratech, for example, is selling floating solar systems to California, which should have been much bigger news. Renewable energy is an enormous export opportunity for Australia. More people live on earth today without electricity than were here when Thomas Edison started spreading the stuff. Most of those people live in nations to the north of Australia. Why can’t we sell some of our solutions and systems for spreading solar and smart energy in these markets? There will be decades of work and trillions of dollars to be made in these emerging markets. If you want an ideas boom, you need to create the infrastructure to mine the minds. Why not build a string of incubators up and down the country, tapping into the power of our people and ideas? We could provide spaces in every city and get the legal, mentoring and capital support to entrepreneurs capable of building the companies and solutions needed. We are willing to help build an energy lab in Sydney - who’s with us? At the end of the day, the transition will not be that hard. We have the technology and the momentum is already there. It’s going to be a bit like the transition we went through from using phones and fax machines to being online. There’s a lot of good work to do, but for most of us it simply means that our electricity service and mobility will be better and cheaper. This is a historic opportunity for ideas and entrepreneurs to arise. The world needs to come up with new combinations of existing things: more than innovation, this energy transition requires great ingenuity. So the challenge is about backing people and their creative genius. Australia has been great at that and could be again, but if you aim to go long on ingenuity, you can’t also be long on a commodity.

Proponents of projects that include energy storage have converged on this small outback city perched on the top of the Spencer Gulf – but why here and why now? The now is easily explained. These companies are seeking to be part of the energy infrastructure revolution promised by the South Australian government, which has recognised that more energy storage is essential to complement the intermittent wind farms and solar plants replacing the state’s ageing coal and gas plants. The proposals are a diverse grab bag of technologies that include battery storage setups either standalone or built into solar PV or gas-fired power plants, a solar thermal tower that uses molten salt to store energy and a pumped hydro project. The transformation underway in the state has even caught the attention of billionaire Tesla co-founder Elon Musk, although the site for his 100MW South Australian battery storage plan – which he promised on Twitter he could roll out within 100 days or it is free – has either not been chosen or publicly announced. The West Australian company Carnegie Clean Energy is another firm planning battery storage for South Australia and Lyon Solar in partnership with American giant AES Energy Storage is also working on such a system. Hugh Saddler, honorary associate professor at the ANU Centre for Climate Economics and Policy, says there are plenty of reasons why so many projects are located at Port Augusta – and why Tesla ought to consider the place. “What Port Augusta has got is a great big node on the national energy market – four high-voltage transmission lines converging on the town,” he says. “It also has a skilled workforce of electrical technicians from the recently closed coal plant, not to mention cheap land.” Spencer Gulf pumped hydro project – EnergyAustralia Long before Tesla’s battery storage systems were a twinkle in Musk’s eye, pumped hydro has been acting as a store for energy. The process involves pumping water from one reservoir at the base of a hill to another at the top and releasing that water back below to generate power. It is complementary to other renewables in that wind and solar farms can provide the power to pump the water uphill when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining and, when they aren’t generating electricity, the water can be released to make up for the shortfall. EnergyAustralia’s spokesman, Brendan Hennessy, says the company and partners Melbourne Energy Institute and Arup Group have engaged in a feasibility study on the prospect of a pumped hydroelectric project but using seawater instead of the freshwater that has been put to such purposes for decades. “The proposed site on the northern end of the Spencer Gulf has 300m of elevation and is within 2km of the coast, close to high-voltage transmission lines,” he says. The company claims the project would be able to produce around 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity with six-to-eight hours of storage, the biggest such project in the world. EnergyAustralia estimates construction would take roughly two years and that it could provide power by the end of 2020. Big battery project – Zen Energy Ever since Musk’s tweets caught the attention of Australia’s most senior politicians, the South Australian company Zen Energy has been jumping up and and down pointing out that it is already set up and ready to roll out battery storage. Its Big Battery Project is exactly what it says it is but Zen Energy is yet to decide exactly how big. The company is examining the possibility of a 100MW version and a 150MW option. The company has a number of solar projects in the Upper Spencer Gulf region and believes a battery storage project would help to stabilise its solar assets and the broader South Australian grid. The company has also formed a partnership with the South Australian gas giant Santos to roll out battery storage systems at gas processing sites. Zen Energy’s chairman, Ross Garnaut, grumbled to the Guardian that “in this Trump era, we have a world where nothing is real until an American billionaire tweets about it”. Solar thermal project – SolarReserve American company Solar Reserve is seeking to capitalise on Port Augusta’s average of 300 days of sunshine a year by rolling out 10,000 mirrors reflecting the sun on to an enormous central tower standing in the middle. The energy generated by the $650m project would be stored in molten salt, meaning the tower could continue providing electricity at night or even on a rainy day – not that Port Augusta has many of those. Solar Reserve has a track record in solar thermal, already operating the 110MW Crescent Dunes project in Nevada and recently announcing a 450MW tower for Chile. The technology has been proven to work around Port Augusta already – a similar solar tower was built for the town’s Sundrop Farms project – a 150m tall tower surrounded by mirrors, used for heating and cooling a greenhouse that produces 15,000 tonnes of tomatoes a year. Solastor Australia has also proposed a $1.2bn solar thermal tower for the town. Bungala solar PV and storage project – Reach Solar Energy Located 7km north-east of Port Augusta on a former ostrich farm, Reach Solar Energy is proposing a $660m solar array with an energy storage system built into the development. The staged construction of the project, which would be of the more common solar PV plant variety rather than solar thermal, would begin with a 100MW single-axis tracking array with plans to add a further 200MW of capacity. The project is the brainchild of former executives from the coal sector who recognised that the closure of Port Augusta’s northern coal-fired power plant in 2016 meant there was a workforce of skilled electrical technicians and spare capacity on the transmission infrastructure just waiting to be put to use. If it goes ahead, the project is expected to supply enough electricity to power over 120,000 homes but the capacity of the planned storage component has not been revealed."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/green-power-and-water-recycling-be-switched-on-by-switching-off","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T21:20:40Z","webTitle":"Green power and water recycling: be switched on by switching off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/green-power-and-water-recycling-be-switched-on-by-switching-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/green-power-and-water-recycling-be-switched-on-by-switching-off","fields":{"headline":"Green power and water recycling: be switched on by switching off","bodyText":"Despite living on Earth’s driest populated continent, Australians throw around water as though the supply were endless. We are the planet’s greatest per capita consumers of water, with each person using an average 100,000 litres a year. Much of that is invisible to consumers, expended on the food and products we buy. Our electricity use isn’t much better. A recent Environmental Justice Australia investigation found east coast coal-fired power stations – where emissions limits trail places such as China – are responsible for deadly pollution that causes a suspected 130 premature deaths a year in Sydney alone. Yet oil and coal remain our primary energy sources, powering 70% of the nation. A wiser approach is slowly becoming apparent, but confusion often reigns. So here are some practical steps on how to switch to more sustainable water and electricity consumption. Use less water at home and recycle where possible Many water-saving tips are common sense: turn the tap off while brushing teeth, fix leaky taps immediately, use a dual flush toilet, only run full loads in washing machines and dishwashers, and get a rainwater tank if possible. (Visit the Nature Conservancy Australia for a more in-depth tips list.) Choosing water-efficient appliances is important, too. The national water efficiency star-rating scheme makes pinpointing winners easier. Some rebates apply for water-saving products; check the environment department’s website to search your area. But inventive Australians are also dreaming up recycling solutions. In Adelaide, Peter Cullin created The Cullector, an easy-to-install shower head that captures water wasted during warm-up time, then reuses it to increase shower pressure, saving an average 35,000 litres of water each person each year. Brisbane’s Chris Murray has something similar with his Redwater diverter, and Mackay’s Eric Winn went a step further. His Winns Water Saver diverts cold water from every hot water tap, which is reused in toilets or the garden instead of being flushed down the drain. Avoid wasting water in the garden by mulching and choosing water-wise plants. Some councils offer native plants free to ratepayers. To more efficiently water trees, consider deep root watering using the Greenwell Water Saver, made from recycled plastic by Adelaide’s Brian Measday. Consider your overall water footprint – and try to reduce it Surprisingly, about 90% of personal water consumption is invisible. Beyond the water we directly use in our everyday lives, almost every item consumed and used by humans requires water to make. (Watch this UNESCO short animation for an explanation.) Food is the worst “virtual water” consumption offender. The agriculture industry is responsible for using two-thirds of all water consumed nationally, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Livestock farmed for meat tends to have a far higher water footprint than vegetable and grain crops, largely because of the feed and water animals consume. That doesn’t mean everyone should turn vegetarian overnight. But moderating meat intake and supplementing with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables – preferably organically grown produce, as better quality soil may retain more water – can help. Dutch non-profit network The Water Footprint illustrates the impact well: producing just one kilo of sheep meat requires an average 10,400 litres of water, while one tomato uses only about 50 litres. The bad news? With no real classification system, measuring and decreasing our personal water footprint is difficult. “The simplest way is to consume less. By purchasing less, we immediately reduce our water footprint,” says University of Melbourne associate professor Dr Robert Crawford, who researches household virtual water usage. “This involves purchasing only what we really need, making products last as long as possible, and recycling, reusing and sharing products.” Power your home with more sustainable energy Coal-fired power plants are a significant contributor to Australia’s greenhouse gas pollution, but alternatives that rely less heavily on fossil fuels are growing. The boom in rooftop solar continues, with a record 135,370 systems installed in 2016, according to Melbourne’s Clean Energy Council. While high feed-in tariffs are now rare, solar can still quickly pay for itself if homeowners calculate daytime electricity use and match panel sizes to that consumption pattern. Choice’s consumer guide is a good starting point, with simple explanations of capacity, costs, solar energy storage and available incentives. “Install five to 10 kilowatts of PV solar panel on your rooftop. You will save money while doing a good thing,” says Andrew Blakers, director of Australian National University Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems. “Australia is installing PV and wind fast enough to exceed 50% electricity by 2030. Electrification of nearly all energy functions will follow, and we can reduce emissions by 75% during the 2030s.” If a hefty upfront investment on solar isn’t an option, embrace GreenPower, a national accreditation program for renewable energy sourced from hydro, wind, solar and waste. Switching is as easy as calling your existing power retailer and choosing the percentage of renewable energy you’d like to buy each bill. Retailers then purchase green power on your behalf, feeding it into the national electricity grid. While end users still receive a mix of fossil and renewable energy, supporting GreenPower drives investment in renewables – a major way individuals can help Australia transition to more sustainable power sources. Other similar options include EnergyAustralia’s carbon neutral electricity plan. Lower your own energy use to save money and the environment The downside to green power can be increased costs, as coal-fired power stations remain the cheapest energy source. That’s where offsetting in your home comes in. Simple things can make a huge difference, such as switching appliances off at the wall, using energy-saving light bulbs, drying clothes outside and using timers and sensors for outdoor lights. (See EnergyAustralia’s blog for a more exhaustive list.) Emerging technology may soon make lowering energy use even easier. The Tesla Powerwall home battery stores solar electricity generated during the day for night use – the first Australian to install one in 2016 immediately cut his power bill by 90%. University of Newcastle professor Paul Dastoor has spent two decades developing a water-based solar paint, which allows printable solar panels that could one day turn our cars and even appliances into solar power stations. And Icelandic company Janulus has launched the world’s first portable wind turbine. Clean water and ample electricity are an essential part of modern life; clever and moderated use will ensure that continues at a rate our planet can sustain.

Landrace crop varieties (sometimes known as folk crops) are ancient versions of the standardised crops we rely on today. Genetically variable, these biodiverse cultivars are allowed to grow at will and to cross pollinate. Farmers collect the seeds from successful crops and these become the parents of next year’s varieties. Simple. If this sounds primitive (it is in fact Neolithic), it makes much more sense than modern agriculture, which is reliant on selective breeds that are addicted to fertilisers. The idea is that the selective breeds give the highest yield when conditions are good. This is a terrible strategy in an era of climate change when conditions are not ideal. Modern agriculture has wiped out almost all original genetic diversity. Ancient cultivars of wheat are used for straw or shoved into seed banks. Proponents of the Real Green Movement want them released into the soil. In the UK it would be tough to live on odd, old grains alone – we lack diversity. In fact the Plant Variations and Seeds Act of 1964 makes it legally pretty hard to grow anything but standardised crops. But pioneers are pushing forward. These include gin makers, the Oxford Artisan Distillery (surprisingly Oxford’s first licensed distillery) committed to total provenance and sourcing all ingredients from a 50-mile radius. Their grain, an ancient rye, is from a farm in Thame, grown especially for them. This is a hyper-local product which makes an active contribution to biodiversity – world’s away from the industrial alcohol bought in by most distillers. From mother’s ruin to saviour of the planet. The big picture: mangrove forest communities We are hooked on dramatic events. So the steady cascading effect of climate change on lives and ecosystems gets little attention. But photographer Arati Kumar-Rao’s work somehow explains unfamiliar landscapes such as the Sundarbans (extensive mangrove forests) in Bangladesh, and how communities are driven to the brink of existence by the effects of anthropogenic climate change (aratikumarrao.com).

The scenario is increasingly common as renewables projects spread across the sunshine state, in some cases swallowing large parcels of productive agricultural land. Clean energy offers billions in potential investment and thousands of jobs for regional Queensland. But it also faces on-the-ground challenges, including turf wars with intensive farming that threaten to hamper the energy sector’s transition. Ash’s decision to offer up part of his Mirani property for solar has made him something of a divisive figure locally. Two fellow growers objected, as did the company that buys and refines his cane, Mackay Sugar. Mackay regional council, whose planning officers had backed the project, voted to reject the application. Legal action is afoot. Whenever he’s asked about the state of the sugar industry or the challenges faced by cane growers, Ash just makes a downward motion with his arm. He wanders around his block, pointing to patches of standover cane – left unharvested from the previous season – where solar panels will ultimately be placed. He says part of the field to be given to the solar company was planted with cane just four years ago. “If I had my time over again I wouldn’t have planted it, the way the industry has gone,” Ash says. “When [the solar plan] come around, the way the industry was going, it was going backwards and it was one way of diversifying into something that’s friendly, it’s not going to do harm. “And if it doesn’t work, well, they’ll reinstate the ground back to how it was. You’re not putting it under cement or doing that sort of thing.” ‘It’s a very sunny place’ Modelling released by the Climate Institute last year showed Queensland had the potential to power 4m homes through renewable energy projects and create more than 7,000 jobs over the next decade, many of them in north and central Queensland where many local economies are struggling with high unemployment and the hit-and-miss legacies of mining and gas booms. The number of jobs on offer is considerably more than at Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, a project touted by many in these parts as an economic saviour. Andrew Stock, an energy expert and councillor for the Climate Council, says about $1.6bn of renewable investment is being built in Queensland. “Obviously ... it’s a very sunny place so solar projects both large and small, are very well suited to Queensland and north Queensland,” he says. “The amount of energy they can generate ... is among the highest output of any solar farms in Australia.” The clean energy regulator says the government’s 2020 renewable energy target has effectively been met by projects either built or under construction. Incentives have led to an industry boom but there is a danger it will shift to bust without changes to policy settings and planning regulations that could threaten the pace of the renewable transition. Stock says the federal government’s national energy guarantee is “woefully inadequate” and will bring forward no new renewable energy capacity over the next decade. “If electricity demand doesn’t grow, and no existing coal plants shut, the modelling by the energy security board last year shows there are virtually no new renewables ... that need to be built,” he says. “And that’s potentially a problem for renewables, that pipeline of investment projects, probably between $7bn to $10bn worth of investment, many thousands of jobs ... and that’s all put at risk because under the Neg, the emissions reduction requirements mean that there’s virtually no new renewable capacity that’s needed.” From overhead, the cane fields are a mesmerising combination of bright green and right angles, stretching for country miles. About 300km to the north of Mirani, near the banks of the Burdekin River, patterned rows of black panels suddenly consume the landscape. The Clare solar farm is the state’s largest, and last month was connected to the energy grid. In 2015 it caused angst among cane growers and was subject to a legal challenge led by the local milling company, Wilmar, until being “called in” by the state government, a process that overrides local planners on matters of state significance. The same conflict between sugar and solar has been repeated at Mirani, and will be again. “The Queensland government has a very strong policy of supporting solar renewables in general,” says Georgina Davis, senior policy adviser for the Queensland Farmers’ Federation. “They didn’t make provision to plan where they would go. They’ve let that be a market-driven process. “It’s just been an unfortunate sort of effect that some of those sites have been on [good quality] agricultural land. Their primary focus is looking for a piece of land that has a willing seller or a willing renter, and that has the access to infrastructure they need.” Solar projects are more efficient, and more profitable, the closer they are built to existing substations, which means proponents have targeted certain blocks. The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors” which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid. “The adoption and interest in large-scale solar has been so quick, and it has had to be quick,” Davis says. “A lot of them have been in a rush to get these facilities up compared to their competitors ... Once that capacity is gone, it’s gone.” Although the operation of the energy market has exacerbated land-use conflicts, planning policies also lack consistency when it comes to land disputes between agriculture and renewables. The Queensland state planning policy lists enabling renewable energy projects as a priority. It also aims to minimise “encroachment on agricultural resources to ensure viable tracts of agricultural land are maintained”. The farmers’ federation and the farm lobby group AgForce have called for a solar code that provides protection for high-quality land and establishes rehabilitation bonds, similar to those for mining tenements. Graziers are worried about the effect of power lines connecting some facilities, and farmers are in some cases uncomfortable that they are close to projects. ‘The industry has got a lot to prove yet’ The Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, says his council would have supported a solar farm proposal had it been on “rubbish land” but state policies required it to consider the agricultural impacts. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the one that’s being contested now or not,” he says. “If it’s growing 9,000 to 10,000 tonne of cane a year and it [is good quality agricultural land], we’re obliged to consider that. And really nothing else trumps it.” Even if state government policy did not mandate the consideration of agricultural land, the council’s priority is sugar, rather than solar, Williamson says. The council has “nothing against solar” and considered building its own solar farm, but found ultimately it would not produce savings to justify the investment. Instead, the region is putting panels at individual council sites. “We don’t want a future for our industry to be less cane farms and to grow solar panels,” he says. “We want more sugar to be produced. We want to grow more sugar for the right outcomes.” Stock says communities such as Mackay, which is a hub for the Bowen basin’s coalmines, should be among the first to embrace the opportunities provided by renewables. They should “start to plan that transition in an orderly way so they don’t end up being faced with really quite dramatic shocks to regional employment when mines close”. Williamson, who argues that Australia should have invested in new coal-fired power stations, bristles at that suggestion. “Well, mate, hang on,” he says. “Queensland generates 14.8 gigawatts of power to run every day and less than 5% has been generated by solar. The industry has got a lot to prove yet. “From a council perspective, we have an industry [sugar] that produces $400m to $500m a year for our valley, for our region ... It is not fair to level at council a head-in-the-sand attitude about renewable energy ... when we have a vested interest in protecting an industry that provides millions and millions of dollars to this district.” For Colin Ash, that same industry, the one he’s worked in for a lifetime, is getting to the point where he’s struggling to make ends meet. Like many other growers he has everything – his income, and his ability to fund his retirement – invested in the land. “It’s not a goldmine what they’re offering [for the solar development],” he says. “When this come along, that was one way of putting a bit of a buffer in there, without the cost of diversifying into something else. “It was clean, green, and no trouble to go back to any other agriculture afterwards if it doesn’t work. “You just can’t get sentimental about these things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/26/tinos-cyclades-greece-island-food-wine","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"A taste of Greece: the new culinary scene on Tinos island","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/26/tinos-cyclades-greece-island-food-wine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/26/tinos-cyclades-greece-island-food-wine","fields":{"headline":"A taste of Greece: the new culinary scene on Tinos island","bodyText":"It’s pretty obvious why the 20th-century Greek philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis called Tinos the “handmade island”. In the 50-odd villages of this 75 square-mile isle in the northern Cyclades, marble sculptors have transformed every lintel, doorway, and fountain into a work of art. Even the For Sale signs on empty houses are carved from marble. The dry stone walls that corrugate the valleys, the intricate dovecotes and the gaping quarries sprinkled around these sage-scented hills are evidence of hard labour, as well as an artistic sensibility. In 1842, French travel writer Alexis de Valon noted: “The whole island is cultivated with great determination, almost in defiance of nature; in the absence of soil, the inhabitants even plough the rocks.” At his Volacus winery in Falatados, in the south-east of Tinos, Michalis Kontizas is continuing this tradition: his organic vineyards snuggle among granite boulders as smooth as giant cannonballs. There’s nothing for miles around but wide-open spaces and fearless goats – one so bold it climbs into our car as we pull up at the winery, a huddle of former shepherd’s huts that Kontizas has restored stone by stone. This windswept landscape is Greece’s new wine frontier. Tinos was a major wine producer for centuries, but when farmers switched to livestock in the 1970s, the vines were ravaged by grazing goats. “The sandy soil protected this terroir from phylloxera,” says Kontizas, a trim, soft-spoken man with a steady gaze. “But organic wine is a gamble: you’re at the mercy of the weather.” After six years of hard graft, he produced his first malagouzia wine in 2016, a small yield of about 2,500 bottles. “Greece needs tourism, as we don’t produce much. But we want those who come to try the things we do produce,” says Kontizas, pouring two glasses of white malagouzia that tastes, intensely, of summer in the Cyclades. On a slab of granite, he lays out slices of pale pink louza (air-dried pork cured in red wine). “I have something special for you try,” he smiles, prising open what looks like a gnarled gourd with a penknife. Inside is a crumbly kariki blue cheese, matured for six months in a pumpkin shell. Made from raw cow’s milk, kariki tastes like a mellow roquefort with the texture of parmesan. Not far from here, Jerome Binda, originally from Paris, has established Domaine de Kalathas, where he experiments with natural wines – with phenomenal results. The organic estate is off-grid, relying on solar energy and local wells for water. A spectacular stone house overlooking the vineyards, decorated with aplomb by Binda’s wife, Sabrina, a ceramic artist who runs workshops in her hilltop atelier, is available to rent. (Her delicate ceramics are available from Trela Tinos, a design and antique shop in Tinos Town.) Over rabbit stifado, tomato fritters, and pickled artichokes at Tereza’s grocery-cum-taverna in the nearby village of Myrsini, Binda tells me how he left a career as a graphic designer and antiques dealer to settle on Tinos: “I was always a wine lover, but never dared to imagine being a winemaker. I thought it was reserved for people who inherited a vineyard, with their own techniques and clientele. On Tinos, I could create my own heritage with 150-year-old, ungrafted vines that had been left to their own devices for decades.” Tereza pokes her head round the door. “Even if I burn the food, I just had to tell you this is the most delicious wine I’ve ever tasted,” she beams, raising a glass of Binda’s beautifully balanced rosé. Like with many family-run tavernas in rural Tinos, pretty much everything on the menu, including the rough-and-ready wine, has been grown, reared, foraged or made by Tereza and her husband Joseph. But there are plenty of restaurants that serve Domaine de Kalathas and Volacus wines. They include San to Alati, Marathia and Itan Ena Mikro Karavi, all in or near Tinos Town, and all using Greek ingredients in inspired new ways. These and other local food businesses have banded together to create Tinos Food Paths, an annual spring celebration of the island’s culinary heritage. “It’s not just cooks and critics, the whole island gets involved,” says chef Andonis Psaltis. “We have barbecues on the beach, cocktail masterclasses in monasteries, and feasts in village squares with lutes and violins.” All kinds of businesses have embraced the island’s culinary revival. Eleni Toli (yogaintinos.com), originally from Athens, abandoned a corporate career to set up a yoga shala in an island house built in 1797, and offers hand-picked herbal teas after class. Beekeeper Nikos Karagiorgis sells exquisite heather honey at his shop (tospititoumeliou.com.gr) in Pyrgos, in the north of the island, alongside a raki, made by his son Dimitris, that he claims is so pure it’s hangover-proof. At Crossroads Inn (studios from €96), in Tripotamos village in the middle of the island, even the chamomile and lavender soaps are handmade locally. Many of Tripotamos’ 40 inhabitants provide ingredients for the Cycladic breakfast – a feast of eggs, preserves, pickles, pies, goat’s cheese and fennel salami. In a tiny hamlet a few kilometres away, guests at Xinara House (xinarahouse.com) will be able to pick persimmons, peaches and figs for breakfast, to go with eggs, milk and yoghurt from local farmers. British couple Peter and Sue Marston, an architect and an artist, are restoring this 18th-century bishop’s residence and smithy with the help of the island’s brilliant marble craftsmen. The estate has its own vineyard and a plunge pool surrounded by colossal boulders and fed by a mountain spring. Village cooks will prepare traditional meals in the kitchen, which is filled with the Marstons’ magpie collection of art and antiques. But the very essence of Tinos is best tasted at Thalassaki, on the jetty at Ormos Ysternia in the north-west (+30 2283 031366, no website). Antonia Zarpa’s phenomenal food – squid ink tarama, goat’s cheese with bee pollen, and octopus with chickpeas, roast onions and lemon jam – has such a cult following that speedboats regularly zip over from busy Mykonos, to the south. Murmurs of delight punctuate the still evening, until a giant wave appears from nowhere, washing away mussels, flip flops, a mobile phone. “This never happens,” the waiter shrugs. The next day, as I’m sampling Tinian cheeses at rival taverna Naftilos, another wave lurches over my table. Tinos may be Greece’s new epicurean destination, but it is still, deliciously, at the mercy of the elements. Way to go For further information on Greece, visit discovergreece.com. How to get there Tinos is 3 hours and 40 minutes by ferry from the port of Rafina, a 30-minute drive from Athens airport. A single crossing for a car and two people starts at €21.50 with Golden Star Ferries. Where to stay Studios at Crossroads Inn cost from €95 for two, breakfast €15pp. The Bindas’ holiday houses, Bergerie Tinos, cost from €100.

The answers are hiding in Arctic air","bodyText":"I am standing on the ocean. Ahead of me, the world is split into two perfect halves: blue sky above, white sea ice below. The view is clean and simple, but a continuous waltz of swirling and shunting is hidden inside those two colours: the inner workings of the Arctic engine. This place is special for many reasons, and to appreciate one of the most unusual all I need to do is to live; to breathe. The air is -2C, but the air coming from my lungs is invisible. The familiar wisps of cold breath that I associate with crisp winter air in Britain are absent. They cannot form here. And that anomaly is connected in a fundamental way to our presence here, on a scientific expedition to study this environment. For two months, the Swedish icebreaker Oden is home to 74 of us, living and working at the top of the world to tap into the stories that the blue and the white have to tell. The Arctic has held on to its mystique for centuries. Many western explorers have pitted their wits, strength, and endurance against this environment, while traditional Arctic communities have learned to work with the complexities of the ice rather than against them. Those of us who live well south of the Arctic circle hear a lot about how the white in the north is changing, but less about how it is. It’s hard to construct a secondhand mental image of what it’s like here. There are no landmarks and you cannot step in the footprints of the past. This is an ocean with an icy shell that cracks and shifts as it’s pushed by the wind, breaking apart into separate floes or piling up to form ridges. Each floe is mostly flat on top, and right now they’re dotted with curvy, light-blue melt ponds as weak summer sunlight trickles into the ice for 24 hours every day. Dark ocean fills the gaps created as floes move apart, but in some places there is no open water for miles. Above the ice, clouds and fog are the norm, and often the entire world is painted only in shades of white. It is quiet. Oden is an experienced voyager in these waters. It was the first non-nuclear ship ever to reach the north pole (in 1991), capable of breaking through a continuous ice layer that is two metres thick. Just the existence of this ship is testimony to human determination to explore challenging environments. But on this trip, the desire to go one step further is merged with self-preservation. The Arctic may be a long way from most of us, but what happens here matters to all of us. The weather up here is intimately connected to the patterns of weather further south, particularly the jet stream that feeds endless British conversations about the weather. As the sea ice melts, shipping routes are opening up across the Arctic, bringing questions about regulation and control over this previously inaccessible region. And this is an important area for many species, providing summer feeding grounds for visitors from the south. The Arctic may be a long way away, but it is woven into all our lives. This scientific expedition was funded by the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat and the American National Science Foundation to answer a specific question: how does the ocean affect the weather in the high Arctic? It’s thought that material produced by life beneath the ice reaches and influences the clouds, but how does that happen and when? Answers to those questions are essential to improve the weather forecasts for this region, and to allow us to predict the effects of the substantial changes in temperature and sea ice that have been observed. Sea ice doesn’t just matter for its own sake. It has a strong influence on both the ocean and atmosphere, and the consequences tweak our planet’s energy budget. The solar energy that flows into the Earth system is mostly absorbed in the tropics, transported northwards by the atmosphere and ocean, and eventually re-emitted into space as infra-red radiation. The Arctic balance sheet controls the final part of that process, and the keys to the energy flow through this vast icy wilderness are held by the clouds. Oden is a tiny speck in the white, drifting with the sea ice only a few miles from the north pole, perfectly positioned between the clouds and the ocean to watch and sample and learn. The reason I can walk outside on a perfectly clear and very cold day and still not see my breath is that the air here is astonishingly clean. Air carries tiny particles, known as aerosols, which form from gases in the atmosphere, or come from vegetation, dust and sea spray. Human-generated pollution adds more, and the air most of us breathe has tens or hundreds of thousands of aerosol particles in every cubic centimetre. On a crisp morning in Britain, the water vapour I breathe out quickly condenses on to those particles, making tiny liquid droplets that I can see. Here at the north pole, there are fewer aerosol particles than almost anywhere on Earth – fewer than 10 per cubic centimetre. The atmospheric scientists on board are fantastically excited about sampling such rare conditions and such clean air. Very few measurements have ever been made in these conditions, and the meteorological data from this expedition is especially valuable. Every cloud droplet needs one of these aerosol particles to get started, and it can be one of two types. There are cloud condensation nuclei, on which water condenses to form liquid droplets, and ice nuclei, which have the perfect surface for ice crystal formation. This is the link to Arctic biology, because tiny organisms in the ocean spit out material with just the right characteristics to do those jobs. That could be very important, if those molecules are regularly ejected upwards from the ocean. But the ice cover acts as a lid, and the low wind speeds leave the small patches of open water unruffled. There is a mystery here to solve – the air here is so clean because there are very few sources of aerosol, especially the types needed to form clouds. But almost every day is overcast, so there must be enough coming from somewhere. Following the chain of logic back from the clouds themselves, you end up asking what generates the minuscule number of aerosols up here, and how they get to a position where they can influence cloud formation. Then you have to piece together the whole puzzle – how air movement, air chemistry, light, heat, aerosols, biology and the ice itself are connected together to control the vast energy flows through this region, which then tug on global weather patterns. It’s a complex problem, and so the scientists on board have a variety of specialisms. I’m living with and learning from ice physicists, chemists, atmospheric scientists, biologists and oceanographers. When questions come up over breakfast, the person with the answer or the necessary equipment may well be at the next table. And everything is easy when you ask the right person. A few days ago, I had a problem with slush forming in a hole drilled through the ice, making me worry it would freeze up. One researcher on board took me to his workshop, and made my day by producing a collection of shiny steel kitchen sieves, strainers and scoops that any posh restaurant would be proud of, brought specifically to scoop icy slush out of holes. The practical challenges loom large in all our lives, and they can’t all be solved with a sieve. We are moored next to a large ice floe around 2km in diameter, drifting with it as it meanders close to the north pole. It is nearly two metres thick almost everywhere, and unusually flat on both the top and the bottom. It’s likely that the floe is around three years old, and originated in Siberia. It provides a surprisingly stable platform to work on, and it’s now home to a 15-metre meteorological mast, two large tethered balloons for lifting sensors into the clouds, a large hole covered by a tent which is the base for a robot submarine, and a small harbour on the far side for launching experiments that float. We walk out to our work sites after breakfast and return for dinner. It’s the closest to a nine-to-five job I’ve ever had. But the temperature is always zero or below, ice is fickle, and everyone working on it must be accompanied by a guard watching out for polar bears. My own tiny piece of this picture is out at the harbour, or “open lead”, a place where there’s a watery gap between floes. One of the proposed routes for biological material to get into the clouds is for bubbles in the water to burst and spit minuscule droplets upwards. Bubbles have been seen in these open leads, but we don’t know how they form or how important bubble bursting is for transporting biological material from the ocean into the atmosphere. I’ve got an ocean bubble camera that peers into the water just below the surface, my electronic eye in the watery world below. I’ve also got a collection of other sensors to follow water flow velocities, dissolved gas, temperature and salinity. My colleague Matt Salter has a floating chamber that sits next to the camera like an umbrella over the water surface, collecting particles from below instead of deflecting rain drops from above. Between us, we can monitor both the bubbles and the particles they spit upwards, so we hope to quantify their importance, filling in one tiny gap in humanity’s knowledge of the Arctic. The experiments are delicate, but deploying them is often satisfyingly physical. We’re towing, mooring, dragging, digging, and tying more knots in a day than I would at home in a year. We work in large flotation suits, which mostly keep us warm and dry, but are also very good at sealing in the sweat produced by physical exertion. A small white hut provides some shelter during our lunch stop, when we unpack and share cold pizza and hot Swedish “blueberry soup” sent out with us in the morning by Oden’s kitchen staff. This is teamwork, our small team at the open lead within the larger team of the ship, which sits within the team of the wider scientific community. Understanding this environment is slow work, but the need is urgent. This region is already changing very rapidly, and we cannot understand the importance of a change if we don’t understand the starting point. Expeditions like this are difficult and expensive to run, but the data they produce is essential. In the next couple of weeks, there will be plenty of news stories about the annual sea ice minimum, but less discussion about the specifics of why it might matter. If the ice changes, many other things will also change, and we need to predict the consequences. As I stand on the ice on this rare clear day, breathing the cleanest air of my life, I wonder what this might be like in 10 or 20 or 50 years’ time. A newly accessible ocean comes with a lot of complications – ships and people and pollution and territorial claims – and maybe air this clean won’t exist on Earth for much longer. Will that matter?

Cleve Hill, a mile from the historic town of Faversham, would have five times the capacity of the UK’s current largest solar farm and provide enough power for around 110,000 households if it comes online in 2020 as proposed. Developers Hive Energy and Wirsol Energy hope to lay solar panels across 890 acres (365 hectares) – equal to more than 400 football pitches – of farmland near the village of Graveney. The companies think that falling technology costs and the economies of scale from supersizing the solar farm mean it will work without subsidies. Only one big subsidy-free solar farm has been built since support was axed by the government in 2016, near Flitwick in Bedfordshire, but that was an extension to an existing solar farm built using earlier subsidies. Hugh Brennan of Hive Energy said: “The Cleve Hill solar park is a pioneering scheme that aims to optimise the technological developments in solar energy.” A consultation has begun and letters sent out to residents ahead of local meetings in December, with the project’s backers stressing they are aware of the site’s importance for wildlife. The area’s salt marshes and mudflats are used by migrating birds including marsh harriers and lapwing. Readers will also know the marshes as similar to the nearby childhood home of Pip in Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations. One resident said he was in favour of renewable energy but there were concerns locally over the sheer scale of the project. Adrian Oliver, owner of the Freewheel cycling cafe in Graveney, said: “I think people are worried about the scale of it, and the infrastructure [roads] impact as it gets built. “I don’t think anyone is anti the fact that it is a brilliant energy source. I’m broadly for it as long it’s done well and doesn’t disturb the wildlife.” He added that the area had experienced some traffic during the building of a substation for the world’s biggest offshore windfarm, the London Array. The proposed solar farm would connect up to the substation. Cleve Hill’s backers said public rights of way that run across the site would not be affected, and footpaths would not be permanently closed. They also promise to limit any impact on wildlife, with a proposal to establish a mitigation area for birds. The Kent Wildlife Trust said its main concern was about the impact on birds that live on its nature reserve adjacent to the site. Brent geese from the reserve, for example, sometimes rest up on the farmland. “The scale is unprecedented. We have a lot of questions,” said Greg Hitchcock, the conservation officer at the trust. The RSPB said it was examining the plans and that it was too early to comment. One green group welcomed the solar farm but said that its enormous size showed government policy meant that community-backed solar plants were being “frozen out”. Max Wakefield, lead campaigner at climate charity 10:10, said: “It’s a real ray of sunshine to see such ambitious clean energy projects emerging in the UK despite the policy obstacles. But the scale this project has had to adopt in order to be commercially viable is also a warning.” The Solar Trade Association echoed that view. “Government policy of excluding solar from clean power auctions is driving larger projects in a bid to get the economics to work,” said a spokeswoman. Cleve Hill could have a capacity of as much as 350MW, though its backers said the final size had not been decided. The scale means the project will need to gain approval from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A medium-sized conventional power plant would generate around 1,000MW. Britain’s biggest existing solar farm is at Lyneham in Wiltshire. It produces 69MW and is owned by the government. There are also several around the 50-60MW mark. However, most of the UK’s solar farms are relatively small, and only around 80 can generate more than 20MW. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-10T12:29:29Z","webTitle":"Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Indian solar power prices hit record low, undercutting fossil fuels","bodyText":"Wholesale solar power prices have reached another record low in India, faster than analysts predicted and further undercutting the price of fossil fuel-generated power in the country. The tumbling price of solar energy also increases the likelihood that India will meet – and by its own predictions, exceed – the renewable energy targets it set at the Paris climate accords in December 2015. India is the world’s third-largest carbon polluter, with emissions forecast to at least double as it seeks to develop its economy and lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty. Ensuring it generates as much of that energy as possible from renewable sources is considered crucial to limiting catastrophic global temperature increases. At a reverse auction in Rajasthan on Tuesday, power companies Phelan Energy and Avaada Power each offered to charge 2.62 rupees per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated from solar panels they hope to build at an energy park in the desert state. Last year’s previous record lowest bid was 4.34 rupees per kWh . Analysts called the 40% price drop “world historic” and said it was driven by cheaper finance and growing investor confidence in India’s pledge to dramatically increase its renewable energy capacity. It reduces the market price of solar tariffs well past the average charged by India’s largest thermal coal conglomerate, currently around 3.20 rupees per kWh . Wholesale price bids for wind energy also reached a record low of 3.46 rupees in February. Kanika Chawla, a senior programme lead at the Delhi-based Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said it was encouraging that Rajasthan project bidders were “new players, not the same old market leaders”. “It shows there is enough happening to attract investment, attract interest from companies who have otherwise been cautious,” she said. Prices were likely to drop further if the cost of borrowing money continued to fall – which she said was one of the major drivers in the record low prices this year. “Any future incremental gains in prices will not come from the decline in technology prices, they will come from declines in the cost of finance,” she said. Investors were also likely encouraged by a recent move to allow the state-backed Solar Energy Corporation of India to act as a guarantor in agreements between energy developers and India’s debt-ridden power distribution companies. Tim Buckley, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the most important factor driving a rush of international investment in Indian renewables was the “transparency, longevity and certainty” of the country’s energy policy. “That is absolutely critical because when you invest for 25 to 35 years, you need certainty and clarity of policy,” he said. “India has prime minister [Narendra] Modi saying this is his number one objective, you have energy minister [Piyush] Goyal talking about it every day. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind about Goyal’s commitment to this program and Modi’s endorsement of what Goyal’s doing,” he said. By 2022, India aims to have the capacity to generate 175 gigawatts of power from solar, biomass and wind energy. A draft report by the country’s electricity agency in December predicted that capacity would increase to 275 gigawatts by 2027. The same draft report said it was unlikely India would need any new coal power stations for at least 10 years, beyond the 50 gigawatts of projects already in the pipeline. Chawla said the successive drops in renewable prices “should be celebrated” but cautioned that systemic reforms were still needed to make the trend sustainable. Renewable energy projects also still enjoyed exemptions from some taxes that fossil fuel-generators had to pay, she added. “We need to run the numbers before we can say [unsubsidised solar] is cheaper than coal, but it’s definitely competitive,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/27/subsidize-coal-nuclear-plants-taxpayer-cost-rick-perry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"Subsidy plan for coal and nuclear plants 'will cost US taxpayers $10.6bn a year'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/27/subsidize-coal-nuclear-plants-taxpayer-cost-rick-perry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/27/subsidize-coal-nuclear-plants-taxpayer-cost-rick-perry","fields":{"headline":"Subsidy plan for coal and nuclear plants 'will cost US taxpayers $10.6bn a year'","bodyText":"A Trump administration plan to subsidize coal and nuclear energy would cost US taxpayers about $10.6bn a year and prop up some of the oldest and dirtiest power plants in the country, a new analysis has found. The Department of Energy has proposed that coal and nuclear plants be compensated not only for the electricity they produce but also for the reliability they provide to the grid. The new rule would provide payments to facilities that store fuel on-site for 90 days or more because they are “indispensable for our economic and national security”. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, said the subsidies were needed to avoid power outages “in times of supply stress such as recent natural disasters”. The plan would provide a lifeline to many ageing coal and nuclear plants that would otherwise go out of business, primarily due to the abundance of cheap natural gas and the plummeting cost of renewables. The Department of Energy noted 531 coal-generating units were retired between 2002 and 2016, while eight nuclear reactors have announced retirement plans in the past year. Donald Trump has vowed to arrest this decline and end the “war” on mining communities by repealing various environmental regulations put in place during the Obama administration. Perry’s pro-coal market intervention would cost taxpayers as much as $10.6bn a year over the next decade, according to a joint analysis by the non-partisan groups Climate Policy Initiative and Energy Innovation. Just a handful of companies, operating about 90 plants on the eastern seaboard and the midwest, would benefit from the subsidies, the report found. “The irony of putting costs on consumers for resources that are no longer competitive is really striking,” said Brendan Pierpont, energy finance consultant at Climate Policy Initiative. “It would serve to keep a lot of uneconomic plants in the market that currently can’t compete with the changing dynamics of cheap gas and the falling cost of renewables.” The Trump administration has raised concerns that the growth of intermittent wind and solar energy could undermine the so-called “baseload” power provided by coal and nuclear, pointing to power outages during the Polar Vortex cold wave that swept over North America in 2014. However, recent studies of the grid have found that it has not been weakened by the loss of coal and nuclear plants and is barely affected by power outages. Also, coal-fired plants are not immune to natural disasters, with facilities going offline during the Polar Vortex and Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas this year. An unlikely alliance of renewable energy advocates and the American Petroleum Institute has complained that Perry’s plan tips the scales in favor of a failing coal industry and has vowed to fight the proposal. The rule would also jar with the supposed free market principles of an administration that has attacked subsidies for wind and solar, as well as intervention in healthcare insurance markets. “Perry’s obsession with propping up these expensive, dirty facilities will cost Americans real money,” said Mary Anne Hitt, a campaigner at the Sierra Club. “These ageing coal plants are making Americans sick, and now Secretary Perry wants to force us to pay tens of billions of dollars to Wall Street to keep them running, so they can continue polluting our air and water.” Perry’s plan has to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is housed within the Department of Energy but is an independent agency. Two of FERC’s three commissioners were appointed by Trump, with one, Neil Chatterjee, already voicing support for subsidizing coal and nuclear. Perry has asked for a ruling on his request by 27 November. The aggressively pro-fossil fuels stance of the Trump administration has been advanced elsewhere this week, with the House of Representatives approving a budget plan that would open the way for oil drilling in a vast Arctic wildlife refuge in Alaska. Meanwhile, the interior department has released a plan to sweep away the regulatory “burdens” that slow down or prevent mining and drilling on public lands.

Home Energy &amp; Lifestyle Management Ltd (Helms), based in Glasgow, has been slapped with a £200,000 fine by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) after pestering householders with millions of automated calls on an “industrial scale”. An ICO investigation found that Helms made over six million calls as part of a massive automated call marketing campaign offering ‘free’ solar panels. It said an organisation should have individuals’ permission – which specifically names the company concerned – in order to make automated calls, yet this was not the case. Helms – an accredited company in the failed Government Green Deal initiative to help people make energy saving improvements to their homes – admitted it didn’t even know what the rules were. In just over two months – from October to December 2014 – the ICO received 242 complaints from individuals. One said they were waiting for news of a terminally ill relative and couldn’t ignore the phone, feeling “powerless” against the barrage of automated calls. The ICO’s head of enforcement, Steve Eckersley, said: “This company’s ignorance of the law is beyond belief. It didn’t even bother to find out what the rules were and its badly thought out marketing campaign made people’s lives a misery. “The monetary penalty is for a significant amount because of the clear failings of the company, and the number of people affected by its deliberate and unlawful campaign. It should be a warning to other companies to think before they launch into a campaign.” The investigation found that the calls were also misleading because the solar panels were not necessarily free as implied by the recorded message. The record sanction is the latest move in a concerted crackdown by the ICO and other agencies on nuisance calls. In the last year, it has received more than 180,000 complaints about nuisance calls, up from 160,000 two years earlier. The ICO was given new powers earlier this year to crack down on nuisance calls, but information commissioner Christopher Graham is now pressing the government to go further. He wants ministers to bring in tougher punishments for individuals who sell lists of phone numbers to cold-calling companies and in doing so breach data protection laws. At the moment the strongest punishment for unlawful disclosure of personal data is a fine from a magistrates’ court Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: “For many people nuisance calls can be dismissed as an everyday nuisance, but for others these types of unsolicited marketing calls can cause serious stress and anxiety. Today’s action is to be welcomed and should serve as a warning to firms that this kind of practice cannot continue.” He said the UK still lags behind many other countries in how it deals with this problem and “there are a number of reforms that could help combat this ongoing issue. The Telephone Preference Service’s current ‘opt-out’ [of marketing calls] system is the lowest permitted by the European Union; firms continue to sell high-risk financial products via unsolicited marketing calls and texts; and the resources available to regulators are insufficient compared to the scale of the problem”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/may/14/secrets-shiny-yellow-buttercup-plantwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-14T20:30:25Z","webTitle":"Secrets of the shiny yellow buttercup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/14/secrets-shiny-yellow-buttercup-plantwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/may/14/secrets-shiny-yellow-buttercup-plantwatch","fields":{"headline":"Secrets of the shiny yellow buttercup","bodyText":"Do you like butter? Hold a buttercup under your chin and folklore says if there is a yellow reflection on your skin it means you do. But the real reason the flowers seem to shine with an intense glittering yellow is nothing to do with butter but about advertising the plants to insect pollinators from a great distance. Buttercups get their bright colour from yellow pigments in the petals’ surface layer, and their shiny gloss is thanks to layers of air just beneath the surface reflecting the light like mirrors. The glowing phenomenon is unique in plants, although something similar happens with some butterfly and bird wings. The buttercup’s sparkling light also needs the sun to be high in the sky, so May is a good time of year for the flowers. And buttercup flowers also track the sun. On cold days, the petals make a cup shape like a satellite dish, collecting solar energy from sunshine and warming up the flowers, which makes them even more inviting to insects, perhaps because it helps them to keep up their own temperature. The cup-shaped flower also focuses the sunlight into its centre where the reproductive organs are warmed up, boosting the ripening of pollen in the stamens and improving the chances of fertilisation in the carpels. And after the flower is pollinated the solar heat might help seed development. The solar tracking is even more useful in the chill air of alpine regions, where the flowers warm up by concentrating the sunshine, sometimes boosting temperatures by more than 3C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/jun/19/sorry-poncey-fashionistas-you-can-wear-what-you-like-at-glastonbury","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T13:19:03Z","webTitle":"Sorry, poncey fashionistas – you can wear what you like at Glastonbury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/19/sorry-poncey-fashionistas-you-can-wear-what-you-like-at-glastonbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/19/sorry-poncey-fashionistas-you-can-wear-what-you-like-at-glastonbury","fields":{"headline":"Sorry, poncey fashionistas – you can wear what you like at Glastonbury","bodyText":"Disappointing news: Glastonbury is to be a showcase for fashion. And I thought music festivals were meant to be a tiny bit rebellious and uninhibited. Aren’t you meant to wear what you like, and make your mother worry about drugs, stinky overflowing lavatories and swirling germs? “That was about 30 years ago,” says Fielding harshly, and he may be right. Now it’s the place for “wardrobe activism” (AKA a slogan T-shirt), athleisure, mastering “the decadent mood” and making sure to “pose and expose”. It all sounds tremendously bossy to me – being told what to wear, and how, especially when you’re meant to be going wild. Apparently, the “catwalk dictates” that yellow is this year’s colour, but ignore it, festival-goers, along with all fashion’s commands. You don’t need to go around looking jaundiced.

You don’t need instructions on how to dress when in search of freedom. “Pair a sequined tee with a mannish oversized coat or a silky trench to keep warm after hours,” instructs Condé Nast Traveller, as if you are all dopes. Just say no. Refuse uniform, wear last year’s rags if you so wish, because fashion is the ultimate in inbuilt obsolescence. Never mind cars and electric appliances, a frock can be over and done with in one festival weekend, or even a day. And Glastonbury’s main message is about saving the planet from needless waste. They use wind and solar energy, recycle “like mad” – no plastic bags, plates or cutlery, they even recycle/compost your excrement, and beg you not to pee in the river, murdering the fish. And please buy a decent tent that lasts, they say. “A tent is for life, not just for a festival.” Isn’t that admirable? So why introduce the throwaway world of fashion to Glasto? Keep away, you poncey fashionistas, glampers and manipulators who are sullying what’s left of the festival spirit. Because there still is some, even if it does cost £238 a ticket.

Donald Trump will hope that trade war optimism, and the hint of tax cuts later this year, might see them wearing “Dow 30,000” before November. But that is for another day. Until tomorrow, goodnight! GW Boom! Wall Street has ended at a new all time closing high. Relief that the Phase One trade deal with China is finally signed lifted stocks, despite the agreement’s flaw. The Dow closed up 91 points, or 0.3%, at 29,031, having earlier hit an intraday peak at 29,127 points. With the Phase One trade deal in the bag, Donald Trump is now hosting a lunch for the Chinese delegation and his own officials. The president sound upbeat, saying that relations between the two sides are better than ever. Here’s my colleague Dominic Rushe on today’s trade deal: Donald Trump has signed the first phase of a new trade agreement with China after two years of tension between the two superpowers that have rattled economies around the world. Trump said: “Today, we are taking a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade. Together we are righting the wrong of the past.” “At long last Americans have a government that puts them first at the negotiating table,” he said. “This is the biggest deal anybody has ever seen.” Trump and China’s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, signed the deal at a packed press conference, attended by Ivanka Trump, much of Trump’s cabinet, Henry Kissinger, and media and business leaders including Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman of Blackstone, and Ajay Banga, the president of Mastercard. The signing came hours after Democrats named the team that will prosecute Trump in an impeachment trial that starts early next week. The first phase of the deal will further open the Chinese market to US companies, and includes roughly $200bn in Chinese purchases of American goods and services. But it will also leave in place much of the $360bn worth of tariffs that the US has already imposed on Chinese goods, and the threat of additional punishment if Beijing does not live up to the terms of the deal. Trump campaigned on tackling what he saw as China’s unfair trade practices, accusing the country of “raping” the US and perpetuating “the greatest theft in the history of the world”. The often rancorous trade dispute has hurt agriculture, manufacturing and other sectors of the US economy, and the uncertainty it has engendered has worried business leaders. But its impact on the broader economy does not appear to have been as dire as some predicted. The trade deal, if it holds, could be a major political boost for Trump in an election year when he can argue his tough stance with China has paid off. US stock markets hit new record highs ahead of the signing. Anahita Thoms, Head of the Trade Practice at law firm Baker McKenzie in Germany, has also kicked the tires of the trade deal....and come away unimpressed. She says that both sides will have concerns -- so we could see Phase Two, Three and Four trade deals in the years ahead. Phase One, though, is not a major breakthrough: “Ultimately, trade wars produce losers. The US has lost because of inevitably higher prices for consumers, whilst China has lost because overall the volume of its trade will fall. However, other countries such as Vietnam have benefitted in the short term by taking advantage of the changing trade opportunities, but in the long term, we will all lose because global growth is negatively impacted when the two biggest economies engage in a trade war for years.” “For now, Phase One doesn’t strike a deal in a comprehensive way. In the beginning, the goal was about securing IP rights, easing the issues around forced technology transfer, market access and subsidies. In regards to Phase One, we are not there yet. Many, before President Trump, have tried to reach such a comprehensive deal, but it remains elusive for now.” Nick Marro, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, also has concerns about the deal. He’s not convinced that China can meet its pledge of buying $200bn of extra goods from America each year. And even if it can, what happens in 2022 when the deal expires? Marro fears that the trade war could flare up again, despite today’s upbeat (and sometimes rambling) signing ceremony. He says: The trade war has demonstrated the problems of overexposure to a single market. But rather than encouraging export diversification, the trade deal risks exacerbating this over reliance through its purchase targets. This is especially because much of these purchases will come via artificially generated demand, rather than market dynamics. Once the two year time frame is up, and China thinks about diversifying its imports, what might happen to US farmers who have since ramped up domestic production on expectations of Chinese demand? At face value, it’s not encouraging as a completely sustainable trade framework going forward. The deal has some encouraging language, but it’s provisions still leave open questions around the severe structural issues in the US-China trade relationship. This, combined with likely difficulties in implementing many of these commitments, suggests that there is a high risk that the deal might fall apart later this year. Companies may need to seriously consider the scenarios around a resumption in tariff hostilities. Dr Kerstin Braun, President of Stenn Group, is also giving the phase one deal a muted reception. She says America hasn’t made progress on key issues, including subsidies for Chinese companies that tilt the playing field unfairly. “The US China phase one deal is long-awaited good news for global trade, which took a hit from the tariff war in 2019 to the tune of $420 billion in lost revenue for exporters. “But while it’s a start, the deal fails to cover the significant issues that prompted the war in the first place. This includes China’s preferential support of state-owned enterprises and technology transfer from American companies doing business there. “Both sides need to accept the larger picture. For the US, it’s that China as an economic power is not going away. For China, it’s that to be in the world marketplace means complying with international business standards. “With a weakened World Trade Organisation and the general trend away from multilateral trade agreements, we’re only going to see more trade squabbles. “China is already showing it can be less dependent on the US economy. China’s exports grew slightly last year overall, but exports to the US dropped 12.5%.” Is today’s deal as momentous as Donald Trump claimed today? No, according to Tim Drayson, Head of Economics at Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM). He says the deal doesn’t address key issues, will be hard for China to stick to, and still leaves trade barriers in place: “The signing of the ‘Phase One’ trade deal marks the widely anticipated ceasefire in Trump’s trade war with China. While this could hold through to November, it probably marks the peak in improving news on the US and China relationship. First, the majority of the existing tariffs remain in place, with no timetable for their removal. Second, it will be difficult for China to meet its target for purchases of US goods. Third, the deal lacks a credible enforcement mechanism. Finally, progress on the key structural issues remain extremely limited.” Details of the trade deal are now being released by the White House. It includes a pledge by China to buy another $200bn of US goods over the next two years, and will come into effect in 30 days. However, China only appears to be promising to buy an extra $33bn of agricultural products (unless I’m missing something). Manufacturing goods: at least $32.9bn more in 2020, rising to $44.8bn more in 2021 Agricultural products: at least $12.5bn more in 2020, rising to $19.5bn in 2021. Energy products: at least $18.5bn more in 2020, rising to $33.9bn in 2021 Services: at least $12.8bn more in 2020, rising to $25.1 in 2021 China has also promised to restrict its requests for access to confidential data when reviewing whether to allow US companies to access its markets, and pledge to speed up the process for authorising US biotech products. That will address some concerns about ‘forced technology transfers’, and the opening up of China’s markets. Donald Trump signals to some of the audience to gather round to see the signing. They don’t need asking twice, and soon the stage is packed. The president is clearly keen to make this Phase One agreement seem like a very Big Deal. But be clear, this is not a comprehensive deal to fully end the trade war. That’s why Trump hasn’t lowered tariffs on China’s goods today. Finally, after more than 18 months of trade conflict, America and China are signing the preliminary trade deal. Donald Trump sets the scene in the White House, saying “The world is watching today, it’s a great honour to be here”. Then he shakes hands with vice-premier Liu He, and the pair head over to the desks where a few copies of the agreement are waiting. A few strokes of the pens later, and the deal is done! Liu He is now issuing a serious warning to the US politicians and business leaders in the White House. He says China and America must work closer together to tackle the world’s problems. Co-operation is the only right choice, he insists. We must work together, with mutual respect. Reminder: earlier today the World Economic Forum warned that environmental dangers are now the top risks facing the global economy. A trade war between Washington and Beijing undermines the global co-operation needed. Simon Evenett,professor of economics at the University of St Gallen, smells a doll-sized rat.... Liu He now turns to his own remarks. He insists that today’s deal is “mutually beneficial”, and complies with trade rules. We will honour it strictly, he promises. Liu is hopeful that the Phase Two talks will go well, citing an old proverb that “a good beginning is the hardest part”. He then says that China will import $40bn of US agricultural goods. If there’s strong demand, they can import more, he adds. [Trump earlier cited a $50bn figure....] Trump is now inviting vice-premier Liu He to address the room (after joking that Liu deserves a break after all his hard work and should catch a movie). Liu produces a letter from his boss, president Xi Jinping! It’s addressed to Donald Trump. The letter begins with Xi telling Trump that conclusion of the phase one trade agreement between China and the US is good for both countries, and the whole world. We need equality and mutual respect, to tackle issues together, says Xi. Both sides must implement the deal in “real earnestness”, and make progress in trade and economic co-operation. Healthy and steady growth in relations will need efforts from both sides. Xi also says that he hopes that US treats Chinese companies fairly, and promises to work closely with Trump. I believe that under our guidance, China-US relations will deliver more results and provide more benefits for our people Xi concludes by wishing the Trump family best wishes, and happiness and success in the Chinese new year. Looking ahead, Donald Trump says the US and China will start talking about a Phase Two deal as this deal kicks in. But in the meantime, the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports will remain in place. We’re leaving tariffs on, but I will agree to take them off if we agree phase two, the president says. We need the tariffs, or we won’t have any cards to pay with, he adds. And Trump concludes his remarks by claiming that “this is the biggest deal that anyone’s ever seen”. It will bring “harmony, prosperity, commerce and much more between the US and China”, and “lead to even stronger world peace.” Honestly.... Trump has finally returned to the details of the US-China trade talks. He says Beijing has agreed to “greatly expand” the products it buys from America, and will buy “much more than $200bn” over the next two years. That includes more than $50bn on agriculture products, $75bn on manufacturing products, and $50bn of energy. He says it also contains very strong IP protections, very strong restrictions on currency devaluations, and has “total and full enforceability”. [But given the WTO is so weak, how will this deal really be enforced, I wonder...] Trump reckons that China is now more open to US beef, pork, dairy, animal feed, and biotechnology. I’m not saying the president is rambling (well, he is...) but Bloomberg TV has now switched away from the trade deal signing ceremony. Viewers probably got the point, after thirty minutes of Trump patting his officials, and himself, on the back. Trump now wants to know why investors will pay for other countries’ debt, but not Americas. The president says this is unfair -- who is crazy enough to accept a guaranteed loss? The reason... is that German debt (for example) is seen as a safe place to place your capital, so it’s worth paying over the face value of the bonds. Also, the European Central Bank might buy those bonds off you for an even higher price, as part of its stimulus plan. Some of America’s top business leaders are in the room, and President Trump is naming them in turn. Most of them are doing incredibly well, Trump says, and it’s all thanks to him (I think this is a joke, but with this president you never know...) He spots Boeing’s CEO David Calhoun, saying he has a big job turning the aircraft maker around after the 737 Max crisis. Not your fault, David, says Trump generously. You’ll straighten it out quickly, I hope? We will, pledges Calhoun, as Trump moves on... ...to the chief of eBay. Trump isn’t happy that items he signs are turning up on the online auction site the next day, such as signed sneakers at $5,000. Sometimes it’s Senators and Congresspeople doing it, he puns. OK, Trump’s veered waaaay away from the trade deal. He’s now banging on about changing regulations so that a firework display can be held at Mount Rushmore. At least he’s not talking about having his name chiseled into the rockface (yet...). But it’s a really rambling performance: Here’s a clip of Donald Trump’s opening comments on the trade deal, before he diverted into picking out allies in the audience and thanking them for their work. Donald Trump is now name-checking various members of his administration, including Mike Pompeo, and thanking them for their work. He takes a swipe at Congress, saying some of his audience may need to leave to vote in the “impeachment hoax”. The president then picks out some friends in the audience, including Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, who Trump modestly says “always liked me, because he’s so smart”. I’m really not sure what the Chinese delegation make of it all, but they’re standing politely and applauding occasionally while Trump hands out his verbal bouquets. Trump turns to Robert Lighthizer, joking that his trade representative has been kept pretty busy in the last couple of years. Was this deal easier or harder than you thought, Robert?, asks Trump innocently. Harder, says Lighthizer ruefully. Trump also gives his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, credit for helping on the trade deal (even though Lighthizer’s team appeared to do the heavy lifting). And in a jovial mood, Trump jokes about how his advisor Larry Kudlow managed to talk the stock market up again after it suffered a rare $1trn selloff last year. Vice-president Mike Pence takes the podium. “This is a good day for America, China and the world,” says Pence, saying the deal helps to “put America first”. Differences will remain between our two countries, but today’s deal signing marks a new, more productive relationship, Pence continues. Actually, that’s a good point -- today’s signing ceremony is significant, if it means Washington and Beijing are on the path towards a full ceasefire in the trade war. The White House band is playing, as Donald Trump and Liu He arrive. Everyone’s on their feet. The president speaks first. Today, we are taking a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade, says Trump. Together we are righting the wrong of the past. He claims that the Phase One trade deal will provide economic security for US families, businesses and farmers. And in a piece of classic Trump, the president says that many people thought such a deal was impossible (who exactly?!), but it should have happened a long time ago. Trump speaks warmly of Liu He being a friend, and says he will visit China in the ‘not too distant future’. The room is now packed. And at the front, there are two desks, each bearing several documents - presumably ready to be signed by Trump and Liu. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have just arrived in the East Room, ready for the deal signing. We’re expecting Donald Trump to sign it for the US, with vice-premier Liu He representing China. Seats are filling up fast in the East Room of the White House, ready for the signing ceremony for the phase one trade deal. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has also hit a new all-time high, over 9,298 points. The signing of the US-China trade deal is due to take place in around 10 minutes. But despite the White House’s best efforts, it’s not the biggest story in Washington today. This is: Wall Street’s ‘fear index’ has dropped to its lowest level of the year: Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time high. These optimistic noises from Larry Kudlow and Stephen Mnuchin may be cheering New York traders, encouraging them to drive stocks higher. This has lifted the Dow by 0.5%, or 150 points, to 29,089 -- a new peak. A former White House cabinet secretary, Chris Lu, has warned that American consumers are paying the price for Donald Trump’s trade wars. Lu, who served under Barack Obama, points out that the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods arriving at US ports are a burden on consumers (as the importer pays them). China is hoping that the White House might roll back some tariffs in the coming months, if the Phase One trade deal holds up. That’s according to the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper which is a good guide to Beijing’s thinking. It says: China and the US are set to sign the long-awaited phase one trade deal on Wednesday (US time); the deal, which involves a nine-chapter text, has fully taken into account the concerns and interests of both countries, and it is expected to bring the world’s two largest economies back on track to stable and sound development, experts close to the deal told the Global Times on Wednesday. The hard-won text involves nine chapters, touching sectors such as intellectual property rights (IPR), technology transfer, food and agricultural products, financial services, exchange rates and transparency, trade expansion as well as bilateral assessments and dispute settlement mechanisms. “The phase one deal, which is signed based on an equal footing, is in the interests of both countries and will be a constraining force on both China and the US,” Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing who is close to the trade talks, told the Global Times on Wednesday. As the two reached consensus on the phase-one deal, US agreed to lower tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese products to 7.5 percent from 15 percent, but a 25 percent tariff remains on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese products. The US also rolled back plans to impose tariffs on all additional imports. “The tariffs will be further scrapped when negotiations in the upcoming months run smoothly,” Gao said. Larry Kudlow is now talking up the US-China trade deal, saying it will be good for the American economy, and the wider global economy. Nothing like this has ever happened before. I don’t care what side of the aisle you’re on, this is a fantastic deal. But he also confirms that issues such as the subsidies paid to Chinese firms, and technology licensing are not covered in today’s deal. Q: But are there any plans to lower tariffs on Chinese tariffs? If the agreements in this deal are adhered to, it will make Phase Two much easier, Kudlow replies. In other words, if America decides China isn’t abiding by its pledges, tariffs won’t be cut. So much for worrying about the deficit! National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to President Trump, has revealed that the White House plans to unveil a plan for additional tax cuts later in 2020. Speaking to CNBC, Kudlow revealed the move would come in the summer -- when the presidential election campaign would be intensifying “I am still running a process of Tax Cuts 2.0. We’re many months away – it’ll come out something later during the campaign. Tax Cuts 2.0 to help middle-class economic growth: That’s still our goal.” Kudlow added: “I had a tremendous meeting with my friend Kevin Brady, who will undoubtedly be the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But we will unveil this perhaps sometimes later in the summer.” Thee excitement around the US-China phase-one trade deal has already faded in markets, even before the ink is wet on the paper. So says Silvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management. The deal is now expected to bear only limited fruit: US officials suggested overnight that in the absence of a phase-two agreement, the US is unlikely to roll back further tariffs against China before the Presidential elections later this year. That is hardly surprising. The deal seemed already fragile when it was announced in mid-December: details were scant (a full document will be provided only after the signing), some of the commitments (such as the $200bn step-up in Chinese purchases of US goods and services in the next two years) seemed unrealistic, and there was extreme vagueness concerning some crucial aspects such as intellectual property protections and technological transfers. All in all, trade tensions between the US and China might well re-surface over the course of the year, also depending on how US domestic electoral dynamics pan out in coming months.” Wall Street has opened calmly, as investors await today’s Phase One trade deal signing. The Dow has gained 60 points, or 0.2%, up to 28,999 points --- tantalising close to the 29k level hit for the first time last week. Mnuchin also told reporters that the White House is “indifferent” to whether the tariffs on US-China trade are reduced before, or after, November’s election. I’m not sure that America farmers share this relaxed approach, given the drop in soybean sales. US firms who have to either absorb tariffs on Chinese imports or pass then onto consumers are also keen to see progress. Treasury secretary Mnuchin has also been challenged over the US deficit, which has jumped by over 11% according to new figures. Is it safe to be borrowing so much, and does this show that Donald Trump’s tax cuts aren’t working? Mnuchin (ever loyal), insists that the Trump tax cuts will pay for themselves over the next decade. He blames spending commitments, rather than taxes, for the yawning deficit. There’s no question that over time, we need to look at government spending issues. That’s the cause of the deficit, not tax cuts. That’s likely to alarm those who fear cuts to social security and Medicare. Military spending has also gone up sharply, and could rise further if geopolitical tensions increase. It’s fair to say that global investors don’t quite share Stephen Mnuchin’s excitement about today’s trade deal ceremony. There’s plenty of disappointment that the White House isn’t cutting some of the tariffs imposed on Chinese imports since the trade war began in 2018 (one CIO dubbed these tariffs a ‘roach motel’ overnight) Investors have also noted that the big issues, such as intellectual property protection and subsidies, have been deferred until a future Phase Two deal Hugh Grieves, fund manager at Premier Miton, says the Phase One agreement doesn’t end the war: “The phase 1 trade deal due to be signed later today will allow both Presidents Trump and Xi to claim a political victory after a bruising two-year trade war. When the details of the agreement are released however, we will be shown just how much, or (more likely) how little, structural reform China has committed to in return for just $200bn of increased imports (equal to only approximately half of China’s 2018 bilateral trade deficit) and some tariff reduction. “But whatever the details in this limited agreement, it does not resolve the underlying tensions, both political and economic, between the two countries and therefore investors should expect further tensions to be a feature of the future investing landscape.” Newsflash: The Phase-One trade deal that America and China will sign today is an “enormous win”. That’s according to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin, who is speaking outside the White House now. Mnuchin insists that this preliminary deal is a great success, even though it doesn’t appear to cover important issues such as cyber crime. This is the first time that we’ve had an agreement with China that addresses agricultural purchases, structural reforms, financial services and currency issues, says Mnuchin. He adds that China has also agreed to buy “$200bn of additional things” over the next few years. Sweeping aside fears that the deal is a damp squib, he says the White House expects “significant growth” this year. This is an enormous win. The average consumer will see a stronger economy in 2020 thanks to this deal.... The deal itself should be signed in a few hours time (11.30am in Washington, or 4.30pm UK time). Just in: British Airways’ owner IAG has filed an official complaint to the European Commission over the rescue of Flybe. The move comes amid a growing backlash to the government’s rescue of the ailing regional carrier from rival airlines, opposition politicians, and environmentalists. My colleague Gwyn Topham explains: IAG has written to the competition directorate of the EU saying that the rescue deal announced on Tuesday night by ministers, which could include a £100m loan and deferral of an outstanding tax bill, contravenes state aid rules. IAG’s chief executive, Willie Walsh, had earlier described the deal as “a blatant misuse of public funds”. The European Commission said it was ready to discuss with Britain its rescue of regional airline Flybe, noting that any state aid should be designed to avoid the distortion of competition and a level playing field. Here’s the full story: Tackling the climate emergency will need some tough decisions. The UK government faces one in the North of England, where a new £165m coalmine in Cumbria is being planned. But a new report, from Lancaster University professors Rebecca Willis and Mike Berners-Lee, shows that the mine would undercut the UK’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. They’ve calculated that the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than 1 million households. Here’s the full story: Our economics editor Larry Elliott is back from WEF’s press conference on its Global Risks report, and says: A year of extreme weather events and mounting evidence of global heating have catapulted the climate emergency to the top of the list of issues worrying the world’s elite. The World Economic Forum’s annual risks report found that, for the first time in its 15-year history, the environment filled the top five places in the list of concerns likely to have a major impact over the next decade. Børge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, said: “The political landscape is polarised, sea levels are rising and climate fires are burning. This is the year when world leaders must work with all sectors of society to repair and reinvigorate our systems of cooperation, not just for short-term benefit but for tackling our deep-rooted risks.” After a month that has seen bush fires raging out of control in Australia, Brende said there was a need for urgent action. “We have only a very small window and if we don’t use that window in the next 10 years we will be moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.”... More here: WEF have tweeted about their Risks Report (which is online here). Top decision makers under the age of 40 have particularly strong concerns about climate, today’s WEF Risks Report has found. It says: The report highlights how risks are seen by those born after 1980. They ranked environmental risks higher than other respondents, in the short- and long- terms. Almost 90% of these respondents believe “extreme heat waves”, “destruction of ecosystems” and “health impacted by pollution” will be aggravated in 2020; compared to 77%, 76% and 67% respectively for other generations. They also believe that the impact from environmental risks by 2030 will be more catastrophic and more likely. So is there any hope? Emily Farnworth, head of climate change at WEF, argues that there is. The Paris Agreement of 2015 sent businesses a clear signal that governments want slow their emissions. She’s also optimistic that social and technology entrepreneurs, springing up around the world, can deliver the “exponential change” needed if the 2020s are to be a “decade of delivery”. We know what the challenge is, we need to get on and address it. WEF’s Risks Report has also predicted that 2020 will see rising political and social tensions, both within countries and between them. So with the added risk of economic slowdown, it could be a turbulent year. 78% of survey respondents said they expect “economic confrontations” and “domestic political polarization” to rise in 2020. Increased political polarisation, extreme heat waves and the destruction of the natural environment are also worryingly likely, with policymakers struggling to make the progress needed on the climate emergency. Here are the six key points from the report (online here). Geopolitical Instability: National politics in many countries has evidenced intense divisiveness and ‘pushbacks’, coupled with increasingly fractious international relations. These volatilities will likely persist, challenging cooperation on key priorities. Economic Concerns: As economic confrontations between major powers grow, the global economy shows greater signs of a concerted slowdown. Climate Response Shortcomings: Weak international agreements belie rising investor and popular pressure for action, against a backdrop of a multitude of natural catastrophes and indicators of longer-term disruptions. 2020 is a critical year for nations to accelerate progress towards major emissions reductions and boosting adaption investments. Biodiversity Loss Impacts: Many ecosystems are in decline or at risk of distinction. Biodiversity loss poses irreversible consequences to societies, economies, and the health of the planet. Technological Governance Deficits: Emerging technology risks can erode social discourse, threaten economic stability, exacerbate geostrategic competition, and pressure national and international security. Getting a better handle on systemic risks will require a significant technology governance refresh at all levels. Creaking Health Systems: Changing societal, environmental, demographic, and technological trends are straining health systems globally. While transformative technology, medicines, and insurance can improve healthcare, they also introduce new risks and trade-offs. Britain’s weak inflation is likely to spur the Bank of England to cut interest rates this month, says Garry Young of economic thinktank NIESR. But he’s not convinced they should.... The surprise fall in UK inflation to 1.3% has knocked the pound back below $1.30. Traders are (understandably) concluding that an interest rate cut is more likely. Significantly, core inflation has dropped to just 1.4%, from 1.7% in November -- showing price pressures are weakening. Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says: The Bank of England has been studiously steering interest rate expectations lower, but this morning’s collapse in core inflation further increased the likelihood that rates will be cut to 0.5% when the MPC meets on 30th January. Core inflation is now back at the levels last seen in 2016.” Shops slashed women’s clothing prices particularly sharply last month, the Office for National Statistics says: The largest individual downward contributions came from women’s casual jackets and cardigans, where prices fell between November and December 2019 but rose between the same two months in 2018. There were also small individual downward contributions from formal trousers and formal skirts. There is evidence of increased discounting, with the proportion of women’s clothing items recorded on sale being higher in December 2019 than in December 2018. Britain’s inflation rate has fallen to a three-year low, making an early interest rate cut increasingly likely. The Consumer Prices Index fell to just 1.3% in December, down from 1.5% in November, to its lowest since November 2016. That’s some way below the Bank of England’s target of 2%. Clothing and restaurants had the biggest downward push on prices. That suggests that retailers have been forced to slash prices to encourage customers through their doors. Q: Is China engaging enough on these issues? Brende replies that it is crucial that China is a part of the global fight against climate. He points out that they have lead a major role in solar and wind power, helping to drive prices down. China has been a “responsible player in sticking to multilateral agreements”....”We cannot succeed... without China on board”, Brende says. Q: Is WEF concerned about the new, pneumonia-like virus spreading in China? The world is not ready for another pandemic, Brende replies sternly. Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, warns that policymakers only have 10 years to address the climate emergency - otherwise they’ll just be “moving deckchairs on the Titanic”. But he’s also optimistic, pointing out that the cost of solar energy is 10 times as cheap as a decade ago. A lot can happen in 10 years, if people react. Here are some key charts from WEF’s risks report, showing how environmental issues (coloured green) are now seen as the biggest threat to the global economy. WEF are now taking questions.... firstly from my colleague Larry Elliott. Q: Next week, lots of the CEOs who say they want to fight the climate emergency will be flying to Davos in their private jets - isn’t there a major reality gap here? Most people who go to Davos go by rail, WEF’s Adrian Monck replies [Larry and I will be chugging up the mountain next week] There’s biofuel at Zurich Airport if you want to top up your private jet, and the Annual Meeting is going to be carbon neutral, Monck adds. But he agrees that Davos needs to do more than just pay lip service to environmental issues. There’s nothing worse than an organisation recognising a risk and doing nothing about it, which is why we take it so seriously. Biodiversity loss and a warming planet are linked, Giger adds -- one can lead to the other. Businesses, consumers and regulators....need to prioritise investments that protect the planet. Peter Giger, Zurich’s group chief risk officer, says the loss of biodiversity is a very serious risk to the global economy. We rely on biodiversity, from pollinating crops to curing diseases. John Drzik, chairman of financial service firm Marsh &amp; McLennan Insights, is now speaking at the Global Risks report press conference. He says there is mounting pressure on the public sector to act on environmental risks, in the face of rising threats. The situation is “bad and getting worse”, Drzik says. Climate impact was very visible in 2019, he says, citing wildfires in Australia, Europe and California, and flooding in other regions. The business community need to focus with more intensity on the risks from climate emergency, but also the opportunities, Drzik continues. Drzik says investors and regulators are taking the issue more seriously, so bosses need to do the same. He cited BlackRock’s decision yesterday to focus on sustainable investment, following heavy criticism for its investment in fossil fuels. The World Economic Forum is outlining its Risks Report at a press conference in London now. The first chapter is called “An Unsettled World” - focusing on the current fractured global situation. This is making it harder to tackle issues such as the climate emergency. WEF’s Mirek Dusek explains: It is the super-risk. All the other risks that we need to contend with, there is this drag that we have to contend with - that we live in a more polarised, more competitive world. The Risks Report also focuses on environmental issues -- such as the threat of accelerated biodiversity loss. A conservative estimate says we are losing 200 to 2,000 species per year -- this is an issue of critical importance. NEWSFLASH: the World Economic Forum’s new global risks report is out! And for first time in its 15 year history, the top five global risks to the global economy over the next decade are all related to the environment. This confirms that the climate emergency has rocketed to the top of the global agenda, with business leaders and economists now awake to the dangers from rising temperatures. The top five are: Extreme weather events Failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation Human made environmental damage and disaster Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse Major natural disasters such as earthquakes. This comes from a survey of 759 global experts and decision makers across the globe, many of whom will be travelling to Davos next week for WEF’s Annual Meeting. WEF are announcing more details from the report now.... Michael Saunders has also produced this chart, showing why he believes UK interest rates should be cut: Newsflash: Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders has warned that the UK economy appears to be stagnating. Speaking in Northern Ireland right now, Saunders says that is recent business surveys suggest there is ‘little or no growth’ in the British economy right now. So with growth sluggish, Saunders favours an “expansionary monetary policy stance” -- ie lower interest rates. In a speech titled Risk management in a sluggish economy, he says: “It probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and possibly to cut rates further, in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target. With limited monetary policy space, risk management considerations favour a relatively prompt and aggressive response to downside risks at present.” Saunders is one of two policymakers who voted to cut interest rates at the Bank’s last meeting in December. Other members of the Monetary Policy Committee have sounded dovish since, meaning rates could be lowered at the next meeting in a fortnight. Howard Archer of EY Item Club reckons Saunders is certain to vote for a cut again. Unusually, the full text of the Phase One trade deal hasn’t been released yet. But Reuters has heard some details: China has pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a source, though some U.S. trade experts call it an unrealistic target. Under the Phase 1 trade deal to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, China would also buy over $50 billion more in energy supplies and boost purchases of U.S. services by about $35 billion over the same period, the source, who was briefed on the deal, told Reuters late on Monday. The agreement also calls for Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods to increase by some $32 billion over two years, or roughly $16 billion a year, said the source. Donald Trump famously claimed that trade wars were good and easy to win. But Washington’s refusal to dial back the tariffs on $360bn Chinese goods shows clearly that trade wars are hard to get out of. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, says US businesses need to hunker down, as they can’t escape these tariffs easily. We’re still stuck with these tariffs which are a drag on growth in trade and manufacturing These tariffs have now become a roach motel.” (for those unversed in Americanisms, this means a place you can easily get into, but struggle to escape) Asia-Pacific stocks have been hit by America’s refusal to lift tariffs on Chinese goods. Almost all the major indices are in the red, as traders face up to the prospect of more trade tensions this year. China’s CSI300 index is down 0.5%, with India’s Sensex losing 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US and China will finally sign their Phase One trade deal today, but there’s no much celebration in the markets. President Donald Trump and vice-premier Liu He will both put their signatures to the agreement, at a ceremony in Washington later today. The deal should calm the turbulent trade conflict between the two nations which blew up in 2018, slowing global trade and hurting the world economy. We can expect Trump to talk up the deal as a major breakthrough, with Beijing agreeing to buy up to $50bn of US agricultural products per year. But the fizz is going flat, even before the corks fly out of the bottles. That’s because the White House has already declared that the existing tariffs imposed over the last 18 months or so will remain in place until a full trade deal deal is agreed. That means tariffs on $360bn of Chinese imports will remain in place, probably until after November’s presidential election. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin broke the news to reporters overnight, saying: “These tariffs will stay in place until there is a Phase 2. If the president gets a Phase 2 in place quickly, he’ll consider releasing tariffs as part of Phase 2.” We don’t know exactly what’s in the 80-page Phase One deal, but it appears to duck some of the really serious sticking points, such as intellectual property protections and China’s subsidies of its companies. Investors fear that a comprehensive trade deal could take a long time to agree, given the long grind just to agree Phase One. There’s also concern that China might not stick to the deal, meaning it could swiftly unravel: As Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, puts it: The US – China trade deal is like watching a live show in the theatre of the absurd. The Trump administration revealed a detail that nobody expected just before the signature of the phase-one trade deal today: the tariff cuts will not take effect before the US election in November. This means that the US tariffs will continue weighing on Chinese exports for almost an additional year, while the emerging market giant will certainly be asked to deliver on its promise to buy massive amounts of US farm goods and manufactured products immediately. The risk here is that the double-standard agreement could provide a weak basis for the future negotiations, impair the benefits, or even spoil the deal. So don’t bank on major action in the markets today, although the Dow Jones industrial average did briefly jump over 29,000 points yesterday, before tariff fears struck.... Also coming up today The World Economic Forum are releasing their annual Global Risks report, identifying the key threats to the global economy ahead of next week’s gathering in Davos. Trade wars, the climate emergency and geopolitical tensions will probably feature highly. We also get the latest UK inflation data - a weak reading could give the Bank of England more leeway to consider an interest rate cut.

The energy grid around Esperance and Ravensthorpe is unreliable at the best of times, but after a bushfire took out the poles and wires around these far-flung outback towns last year, the power company asked residents if they might be interested in trying out a more economically and environmentally sustainable way to keep the lights on and the bar fridge humming. Rather than fully rebuild the sprawling infrastructure required to reconnect all residents to the grid, network operator Horizon Power turned to WA renewables pioneer Carnegie Clean Energy to help roll out stand-alone solar and storage systems. The Carnegie managing director, Michael Ottaviano, said the scheme had led to a new phenomenon in the towns. “People assume the grid is something reliable and permanent, but in reality it is a centralised system with very long lines out to remote communities – it is in fact highly susceptible to failure,” he says. “And when it does now we’re hearing our customers are having blackout parties. You take Raventhorpe for instance, which has several hundred houses, only half a dozen of which have our systems – the people living there suddenly become very popular when the power goes out.” Rodney Locke, a farmer near Esperance, says blackouts had plagued his property long before the Yarloop bushfire decimated the area’s energy infrastructure last year. He says he jumped at Horizon Power’s offer for an alternative way of doing things. He had his property fitted out with a solar and storage system, and has had the odd visitor since – although nothing too out of hand, he says. “There are a couple of people we know who drop in once a week anyway, so, well, if there’s a blackout, instead of sitting at home in the dark, they come and visit,” he says. “The beer does stay colder with the power on – it doesn’t have to be drunk as quick. Actually, come to think of it, maybe it should be the other way round? Maybe we should be the ones visiting the places with no power – help drink their beer before it gets warm.” It is but one small example of how perceptions around solar energy are changing in what remains one of Australia’s most politically conservative states. Once regarded as an eco-warrior’s pipe dream, renewable energy is suddenly the hottest ticket in WA, a gateway to independence in a fiercely self-reliant place. A breakdown of data from the Clean Energy Regulator has concluded the state is rising in the solar energy national rankings. Analyst Warwick Johnston, the managing director of SunWiz, said WA’s rise is the most notable outtake from the industry research. “The biggest change has been Western Australia leapfrogging Victoria into third place when it comes to the number of new solar installations,” he says. Queensland and New South Wales remain in first and second position respectively. Johnston noted solar installations numbers spiked in late 2016, and continued on into the new year, with the first quarter of 2017 one of the industry’s strongest-ever periods. He partly credited solar and storage systems like those rolled out by Horizon Power in Ravensthorpe and Esperance for the growth. “With batteries now readily available on the market, many people are taking this opportunity to install both solar and batteries – or to upgrade the size of their existing solar systems,” he says. “The price of solar has dropped low enough and power prices are rising high enough for this to make economic sense for many commercial operators, too.” The Horizon Power managing director, Frank Tudor, confirmed that increasingly affordable technology was at the heart of the growth. “Horizon Power is quickly responding to the growing demand for solar which, coupled with declining costs of the related technology, is allowing us to offer a greater range of solutions in this space,” he says. “This includes battery storage at a power station level, stand-alone power systems for individual customers and later this year, an increase in hosting capacity which will allow more solar on rooftops in many of our microgrids.” The company has also just reached agreement to expand stand-alone power systems into Exmouth, in the north of the state. Solar power has become so popular in some parts of Western Australia that there are more households equipped with panels than without. The national leader is Baldivis, south of Perth, where two-thirds of households feature rooftop solar. Other strong WA performers include Byford (56%) and Rockingham (53%). There is now six gigawatts of solar power installed across the country. The Australian Photovoltaic Institute chair, Renate Egan, said an additional 1GW was added over the past year by household-scale solar in tandem with commercial and large-scale solar farms. Egan says: “Solar power now makes up 11% of our country’s total electricity generation capacity with more solar added to the system in 2016 than any other fuel type.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jul/06/climate-change-how-victoria-trumped-new-south-wales-in-the-great-renewable-energy-race","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-06T00:16:00Z","webTitle":"Climate change: how Victoria trumped New South Wales in the great renewable energy race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/06/climate-change-how-victoria-trumped-new-south-wales-in-the-great-renewable-energy-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/06/climate-change-how-victoria-trumped-new-south-wales-in-the-great-renewable-energy-race","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: how Victoria trumped New South Wales in the great renewable energy race","bodyText":"Two years ago Rob Stokes, the then environment minister for New South Wales, promised that his state could become Australia’s answer to California in the clean energy industry. “We are making NSW No 1 in energy and environmental policy,” Stokes, a Liberal, told the Clean Energy Week gathering in Sydney in July 2014.“When it comes to clean energy, we can be Australia’s answer to California.” It was a bold vision, and a laudable one, but it didn’t turn out that way. Investment in large-scale renewable energy, apart from some federally funded large-scale solar projects, has all but dried up. In May, a report by the Climate Council rated NSW as the “worst place” for renewable energy investment in Australia. It’s ironic because NSW has the biggest pipeline of undeveloped renewable energy projects in the country. But now other states are seeking to grab a bigger share of the renewable energy pie, particularly as traditional industries of car manufacturing and steel-making face an uncertain future. Last month Victoria became the latest Labor government to announce renewable energy targets over and above the federal target, announcing it would aim to have 25% of its electricity served by renewable energy by 2020, and 40% by 2025. That compares with a national target that translates to about a 23% by 2020, and the Australian Capital Territory’s 100% target by 2020, Queensland’s 50% target by 2030 and South Australia’s 50% target by 2025, a percentage it is likely to reach later this year. But Victoria’s target appears the most ambitious of the lot, simply for the sheer number of new wind and solar farms that will be needed to meet the target. And it also intends to have legislation in place from next year that will ensure the target is met. The 40% by 2025 target translates into some 5,400MW of new renewable energy capacity to be installed within the next 10 years. That will be almost exclusively wind and solar farms and is three times as much renewable energy capacity as the state has installed up till now and nearly equal to the national target for 2020. “This is an ambitious target but a very achievable target,” says the Victorian energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. She intends to adopt the system of “reverse auctions” pioneered successfully by the ACT, which will have some 600MW of large scale renewables in place by 2020 to meet its own 100% target. Already, under a previously announced tender designed to support wind projects, the Victorian government has signed contracts that will help two windfarms be built over the next year – a 13-turbine windfarm at Kiata near Horsham and a 44-turbine windfarm at Mount Gellibrand near Colac. It is not the first time that Victoria has stepped into the national policy arena with its own state-based target. It did the same in 2006, when the federal target came to an unexpected standstill, and several wind turbine manufacturing facilities were closed down. At that time, the Victoria government introduced its own state target, known then as the Victorian renewable energy target, to protect jobs and get projects built. One of the few manufacturers that remain is Keppel Prince in the coastal town of Portland, which specialises in building towers for wind turbines. It recently completed an order for 35 turbines for the Ararat windfarm – which won a tender in the ACT auction system – and is looking forward to new business. “The prospects look good,” says Steve Garner, the general manager at Keppel Prince. He estimates that the target will require 150 new wind towers each year for 10 years. “That’s quite exciting for an organisation like ours,” he says. “It’s a huge boost for employment and it’s a huge boost for manufacturing. Garner was forced to slash his workforce by nearly half because of the investment drought caused by uncertainty in the federal target but he has since re-employ about 50 people and hopes that by 2017 his wind turbine division can get back up to around 300 jobs. The Clean Energy Council chief executive, Kane Thornton, says Victoria’s initiative will build confidence for the sector that has had little in the past three years. “It adds to the belief that renewables do have a strong future in this country,” Thornton says. “And it will help meet the national target, which requires 6,000MW of new capacity by 2020. “It is also smart timing ... It should see Victoria claim a big share of the renewable energy pie out to 2025 and beyond … and facilitate the creation of new jobs in emerging industries in regional and rural areas of Victoria, where renewable energy power plants are usually built. Wind is expected to be the biggest winner from the new target and Leigh Ewbank, from the Yes2Renewables campaign that brought together a number of NGOs pushing for a higher target, estimates there are about 3,000MW of large-scale wind projects in the state that are – or close to – being “shovel ready”. These include 2,300MW of “approved” projects such as the 450MW Stockland Hill and the 312MW Moorabool projects, both near Ballarat. There are another 14 approved projects of various sizes. Ewbank also says it will provide a lifeline to manufacturing groups across the state, including Keppel Prince and others such Olex Cables and Wilsons Transformers in Geelong and the western suburbs of Melbourne. “A doubling of Victoria’s wind energy capacity in less than four years is a huge opportunity for local manufacturers,” Ewbank says. “The Andrews government can get the best outcome for jobs by encouraging renewable energy companies to use local content.” Indeed, wind is not the only opportunity. D’Ambrosio also expects a significant amount of large-scale solar projects, although she says it is too early to put a number on it. That should provide opportunities for companies like IXL Solar, a subsidiary of the family-owned, Geelong-based auto parts manufacturer IXL that is looking for new opportunities in new industries. IXL Solar, which was established in 2012, is now Australia’s only manufacturer of framing systems, upon which solar panels are mounted in large solar farms. Its general manager, Claude Dagescy, says the sector has “been on hold” but there is a surge of new interest, particularly after Arena offered $100m in grant funding for large-scale solar projects. Two of 20 shortlisted projects are located in Victoria – the Gannawarra solar farm near Kerang and the Bannerton solar farm – and Dagescy says that the Victorian initiative will offer new opportunities for other projects. “We see this as quite positive. We need certainty around the policies and we need commitments from project developers.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jul/25/de-bortoli-aims-first-zero-waste-winery-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-25T04:25:46Z","webTitle":"Wine without waste: De Bortoli aims to be Australia's first zero-waste winery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/25/de-bortoli-aims-first-zero-waste-winery-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/25/de-bortoli-aims-first-zero-waste-winery-australia","fields":{"headline":"Wine without waste: De Bortoli aims to be Australia's first zero-waste winery","bodyText":"One of Australia’s biggest family-owned wineries wants to become the country’s first zero-waste wine producer, and has invested more than $15m to achieve this goal. De Bortoli Wines, which has wineries at four sites in two states, has already cut the amount of waste it disposes to landfill from 300 tonnes a year to 48 tonnes as part of a long-term sustainable business plan adopted in 2004. This ambitious environmental management plan, which the company calls its carbon economy project, has resulted in the redesign of almost every aspect of production, from refrigeration, lighting and packaging to wine filtration pumps, compressors and composting systems for industrial waste such as grape skins, stems and seeds. It has been a massive and meticulously planned undertaking for managing director and third generation winemaker Darren De Bortoli, and the company’s operations manager, Rob Glastonbury. Although the company’s main winery is at Bilbul, a small Riverina town about six kilometres north-east of Griffith in southern New South Wales, it also owns two wineries in Victoria – in the Yarra Valley and the state’s north-east – and another at Pokolbin in the Hunter Valley in NSW. That has meant coordinating industrial energy audits, feasibility studies and production trials across the four sites, each with differing regional climates that are reflected in localised variations in energy and water consumption. De Bortoli says the family company’s commitment to sustainable business initiatives began with an application to the NSW Environment Protection Authority to expand the Bilbul winery. “We had to prepare and submit an environmental assessment to the EPA as part of the expansion plan – that led to discussions about how we could improve production systems, do things differently,” he says. The WFA has also introduced a set of policies covering water use, climate change, farm biodiversity and genetically modified organisms. The climate policy encourages members to “minimise greenhouse emissions across all stages of production” and urges federal and state governments to “adopt a consistent approach to greenhouse gas and climate change, including adaptation strategies.” De Bortoli is also a Winemakers’ Federation of Australia (WFA) committee member, and was involved in developing the WFA’s environmental policies, which cover water use, climate change, farm biodiversity and genetically modified organisms. The WFA has played a critical role in shaping the industry’s approach to sustainability. In 2000 it launched a 10-year marketing strategy that urged growers to preserve the reputation of Australia’s wines through “environmental policies which manage salinity, pollution and urban encroachment”. De Bortoli also says he gave the former prime minister Tony Abbott “quite an earful” about Murray Darling basin water reform measures, and the need to “revisit some of the policies around groundwater extraction” and salinity. The De Bortoli company became a founding member of the Australian Wine Research Institute’s environmental assurance program, Entwine. It’s a voluntary certification audit that sets environmental standards for a list of “business metrics” that include winery wastewater management, carbon emissions and use of synthetic refrigerants. Glastonbury says environmental certification doesn’t automatically “get more dollars, but it certainly opens more doors” in both global and domestic markets. “For many of our customers, unless you can tick that clean and green box, forget it. There’s an RSL club on the north coast of New South Wales, and they want to see environmental certification before they start placing orders,” he says. Glastonbury says one of the most important, and early, environmentally inspired decisions for the company was to eliminate all sodium-based chemicals used in production and cleaning because of concerns about increasing levels of soil salinity across the Murray-Darling Basin. “It was Darren’s decision, and it was a revolution – a huge change – because it meant we could reuse our waste water. It changed the industrial ecology of the business,” Glastonbury says. De Bortoli says his decision to eliminate sodium was inevitable and “a no-brainer.” “It was good sense and good science. We’re a business that’s operating in the Murray-Darling Basin and that means we’ve got to look at ways we can tackle regional issues like salinity and water efficiency.” The company switched to potassium-based cleaning agents, which means the effluent contains potash, commonly used as an agricultural fertiliser. Prior to the decision to go no-sodium, the winery’s wastewater was stored in large holding dams to allow oxygen to break down organic matter, and then transferred to evaporation basins. The waste water from the Bilbul winery is now used to irrigate grain and fodder crops on a neighbouring farm owned by the De Bortoli family, and the sale of these crops offsets the costs of wastewater management at the winery. Glastonbury says the company installed a new low-energy wastewater treatment plant at Bilbul, which has cut electricity costs by about $200,000 a year. At the Yarra Valley winery, an aerobic biotreatment plant is used to filter and recycle wastewater. It’s the largest vineyard in Australia using biological viticulture techniques based on sustainable soil management practices advocated by US soil microbiologist Dr Elaine Ingham to improve water retention and soil health. The winery has also introduced a composting system that uses waste windrows, or rows of compost heaps, to produce organic fertiliser for the vineyards. Other environmental initiatives at Yarra Valley include planting habitat and food trees for wildlife and brewing vats of compost tea using rainwater harvested onsite. Glastonbury says the sustainability master plan for the four wineries aims to improve energy and water efficiency, minimise waste and cut carbon emissions while also cutting production costs. One of the complex, long-term sustainability challenges is developing a smoother, more continuous “one shot” production system that will create further energy savings. The company is working with scientists from the University of Technology Sydney, who are studying the properties of wine particles to identify ways to minimise processing requirements. In 2013, the company installed the Australian wine industry’s biggest solar panel array at its Bilbul winery, and De Bortoli jokes that the system “pumps out so much electricity that we’re now registered as a power station”. The solar array supplements power from the grid, and has cut the company’s carbon emissions by more than 314 tonnes a year. Their efforts have been recognised and supported by the NSW government’s sustainable advantage program, and won an Australian Business award for Sustainability in 2015. The bottom line is, of course, whether the company’s carbon economy project delivers significant savings and return on investment. Glastonbury estimates that redesigning the winery’s aeration system has reduced power requirements “from 400 kW hours to eight, which saves us over $240,000 a year”. Return on investment is currently at about 20% over five years, and the company has cut its carbon emissions by more than 2,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year. What’s next? De Bortoli says there are new challenges in improving cross-flow filtration methods and reducing sediments in the waste stream. “The road to becoming a sustainable business is a long and interesting one,” he says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/31/australia-residents-solar-rooftop-lose-payments","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T04:10:53Z","webTitle":"From solar boom to bill shock: Australians face loss of rooftop payments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/31/australia-residents-solar-rooftop-lose-payments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/31/australia-residents-solar-rooftop-lose-payments","fields":{"headline":"From solar boom to bill shock: Australians face loss of rooftop payments","bodyText":"Jonathan Shaw got solar panels installed on the roof of his home in Sydney in 2011 and ever since has been riding something of a gravy train. He has been getting 60c for every kWh he sells back to the grid. That’s much more than the 25c he pays for each kWh he buys from the grid. But that’s about to change. “We’re about to get a major reduction, I think,” says Shaw. Like many solar customers, Shaw is aware that something is going to change, but is unsure what precisely is going to happen and what he needs to do about it. He’s one of more than 275,000 people across Australia who will see the subsidised payments they receive for their solar energy disappear over the next six months, replaced with rates up to 80% lower. The solar boom in Australia, which has led to 1.5m households generating their own electricity from the sun, was accelerated by subsidised payments for people who sell solar-generated electricity back to the grid. In some cases, like Shaw’s, solar customers were able to receive more than twice the money for the electricity they put in the grid, compared with what they paid for electricity they took out of it. But for a lot of homes and businesses, those schemes are coming to an end over the next six months and, if they’re not prepared, they will be heading towards some serious bill shock. Customers in New South Wales, who got the most generous rate, will be in for the biggest hit and will need to do the most to adapt to the changes. “At best, they’ll cop a turnaround of about $1,000 or a bit more,” says Damien Moyse, energy policy manager at the Alternative Technology Association. “But if they’ve got a big system their turnaround will be two or three thousand or even more next year.” In NSW, very generous deals were on offer between 2010 and 2012. People who signed up then have been on those rates ever since. What’s more, the NSW scheme offered that rate for every kWh they produced, rather than just the excess they didn’t use themselves. But from 1 January 2017 they will get paid as little as 5.5c per kWh for the power they put back into the grid. That means the economics will completely flip, and rather than being able to rake in cash by selling electricity back to the grid they’ll want to use as much as they possibly can. “If you use the solar on site, then you’re avoiding paying 25c for every kWh,” Moyse says. “That value to you is five times higher to you than putting it into the grid at 5c.” While about 150,000 homes and business will be kicked off these schemes in NSW on 1 January 2017, the party is ending for about 130,000 customers in Victoria and South Australia too. (Others are on schemes that will continue for years to come. So if people are confused about their own feed-in tariffs, they should ask their retailer what’s happening with them.) Regardless of how much people are getting hit by the changes, the principle is the same for everyone coming off a subsidised scheme – and indeed for anyone with solar or anyone planning on getting solar without a subsidised feed-in-tariff: the way to make the most of the system is to use as much of it as people can to run appliances, displacing energy people would otherwise buy from the grid. How exactly to do that, though, can be confusing. Which appliances should be replaced? How should they be run? And are batteries a good idea? The first thing solar homes and business need to make sure they have is the right meter. Smart meters The issue of what kind of meter to get is a minefield right now, with different issues affecting consumers depending on where they are, and options are changing rapidly. One thing that can help anyone make the most of their solar electricity is a smart meter, says Claire O’Rourke, national director of Solar Citizens, a group that lobbies on behalf of solar customers. A smart meter can be read remotely, and can tell when the most power is being drawn, helping maximise the benefits. They can also open up services such as time-of-use tariffs, providing savings for people who avoid using energy during periods of high demand. “You’re probably better off with a smart meter but they do have an increased cost,” says O’Rourke. Some retailers are offering discounts for smart meters in return for fixed-term contracts. “It is really in the interest of consumers to shop around,” she says. For many people right now a smart meter could be overkill. The smart meter will either be paid upfront, or in the case of free meters offered by retailers, will be paid for through increased tariffs, says Moyse. Whether the meter will allow consumers to recoup that cost is unclear. For people outside NSW, the lowest-cost option is to keep their current meter, at least until it’s clear a smart meter is worth it. Outside NSW, the current meter will work fine on the new deals. Unfortunately, for most people on the NSW solar bonus scheme, their meters will need to be replaced. For those customers, their meters were sending all of their solar generation into the grid. And all the electricity used was coming from out of the grid. So really, these consumers were not using any of their solar power directly. So effectively, those who do not change meters will receive a small feed-in tariff for all of their solar generation, and then be buying all the electricity they use from the grid at a higher rate. In technical terms, those customers are only doing “gross metering” but after 1 January, if they want to sell any energy back to the grid they need to be doing “net metering”. But whether people will need a whole new meter – which could cost about $600 – or for the current meter to be rewired, depends on where in NSW they are, and who the electricity distributor is. Moyse says rather than rushing to get a meter upgrade, it might be best to wait a few weeks or even months after 1 January, when there will be time to compare the various offers. “It doesn’t matter even if you go a few months with your current meter,” he says. “The economic impact of that doesn’t matter too much, compared to if you change your meter early. It might cost you tens of dollars for the year.” Battery power? Jonathan Shaw says he’s very interested in getting battery storage for his house, but they’re too expensive right now. “Once the price of batteries comes down we will think about that,” he says. In principle it makes sense: the sun only shines during the day when many people are at work and unable to use all their solar-generated electricity. But if you can put that energy in a battery, then you can use it any time. And the loss of generous feed-in tariffs is driving interest in battery storage, says Chris Cooper, chief executive of Suncrowd, a company using group purchasing power to get cheaper prices for batteries. “It’s a bit of a trigger point for people to look at new technology,” Cooper says. So far Suncrowd has run its first round in Newcastle, and had about 200 homes join together and buy batteries at discount rates. He says lots of the customers who have been approaching Suncrowd have been people coming off the NSW solar bonus scheme. Having a battery added to an existing solar system can significantly increase “solar self-sufficiency”, Cooper says, a measure of how much the customer relies on solar rather than electricity from the grid. “With an appropriately sized battery you can boost it from 20% to about 60 or 70% self-sufficiency,” he says. Cooper says Suncrowd is building an online tool to help people calculate their solar self-sufficiency and have been showing it to people at events they’ve been holding. “People are really motivated by seeing the numbers go up,” he says. “Even at the bulk-buy prices that we get, the return on investment, there’s other ways you could spend your money. But there’s plenty of intrinsic value that might not be reflected in the bill savings that come with the solar self-sufficiency.” According to a report Moyse published this month, at current prices batteries will not save most people any money. And looking at estimates of how the prices will change, they won’t save many people money until at least 2020. If people do get batteries, the most economic type of system will be a medium or large solar system, combined with a small battery. “That will only supplant a small amount of your overall load, but it’s at least being fully utilised,” Moyse says. Get off the gas Moyse says it’s the most important thing people can do to maximise their use of solar generation, especially in warmer places such as NSW. “There’s no point having gas and solar and electricity delivered from the grid,” he says. “You’ve got three fuel sources there. “If you’ve got gas, you’re generally running one of your two main loads – hot water or space heating – on gas. That’s about 70%, for most people, of your energy use. You really need to run one or both of those on electric to be able to soak up all your solar generation.” For water heating, very energy-efficient heaters such as heat pumps, running off solar generation during the day can be very effective. In NSW and South Australia, depending on the size of the solar system, water should be able to be heated on solar generation. When it comes to space heating, there are a number of options. A house can be preheated while the sun is out, so less power is needed to heat it at night. Or there are heat banks which use the solar generation during the day to heat clay, concrete or ceramic, and then release it at night. Efficiency, time and shopping around Running as many appliances during the day when the sun is shining will help use as little from the grid as possible and help use up as much solar generation as possible. Most new appliances have timers on them that will allow them to run when nobody is home. Since the appliances will still be running things at night – lights, the fridge etc – when there’s no solar generation coming from the roof, it will help to buy energy-efficient appliances when it is time to replace them. Shaw says that at least for the next couple of years, he’s not going to change much about what he does. He says under his solar-adorned roof, he’s got efficient LED lighting throughout, has a top-rated energy-efficient fridge and has triple glazing on his windows. Since he works from home, he already runs most of his appliances during the day. He will get a net meter but, other than that, he’s going to continue as usual. “We’ve done our best to have a low-consumption house anyway and we’re not going to be doing anything much different.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/18/australian-homes-among-first-to-get-teslas-powerwall-solar-energy-battery","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-18T03:08:53Z","webTitle":"Australian homes among first to get Tesla's Powerwall solar-energy battery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/australian-homes-among-first-to-get-teslas-powerwall-solar-energy-battery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/18/australian-homes-among-first-to-get-teslas-powerwall-solar-energy-battery","fields":{"headline":"Australian homes among first to get Tesla's Powerwall solar-energy battery","bodyText":"Australia will be one of the first countries in the world to get Tesla’s vaunted Powerwall battery storage system, as several other companies scramble to sign up Australia’s growing number of households with solar rooftops. US firm Tesla said that its 7kWH home energy storage units would be available by the end of the year in Australia, ahead of previous predictions it would arrive in 2016. The Powerwall is a unit that sits on an interior wall. It has a lithium-ion battery, used to store energy created by solar panels on the household roof. Tesla, which also makes electric cars, is the most high-profile company in the emerging battery storage industry – an area that is seen as crucial in making intermittent renewable energy such as solar and wind into a reliable accompaniment, or even alternative, to fossil fuel-fired power grids. Canberra-based firm Reposit Power, which enables people to directly buy and sell their stored electricity, has partnered with Tesla for Powerwall’s launch. There are a handful of existing Australian alternatives to the Powerwall, such as Redflow, headed by Simon Hackett, who founded Internode. Hackett also sits on the board of the NBN. “Tesla’s arrival is important because they have such a high profile,” said Prof Anthony Vassallo, a sustainable energy expert at the University of Sydney. “The Tesla product isn’t unique by any stretch, but it’s the Apple brand of the battery storage industry, they have the sex appeal that others don’t. “Solar PV and batteries are such a wonderful combination. Australians have demonstrated they are quite happy to purchase PV systems, Australia has a great solar resource and to have a battery to store that makes a lot of sense. “There are packages of PV and batteries being offered by retailers and, as prices come down, we’ll see a lot more of this. Tesla’s price point in the US – of about US$3,000 ($4,173) – would be competitive here, it will sharpen up the players to make more efficient and higher-performing systems.” Vassallo pointed out that the technology still has some way to improve – a 7kWH system will store little more than an hour’s electricity generated by a typical 5kWH solar system, meaning that some people may have to have several Powerwall, or equivalent, systems on their walls. “I’d be wary of claims that people can go entirely off the grid, but it’s a first step,” he said. “Australia has high electrity prices, and once the price is acceptable I think the take-up will be strong.” There are more than 1.3m households in Australia with rooftop solar, with the number increasing rapidly as the price of PV systems tumble. State-based tariffs have been gradually withdrawn across the country, while the federal government announced in July that it would instruct the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to favour large-scale solar over rooftop solar in its funding decisions. Labor has set a target of Australia generating 50% of its electrity from renewable energy by 2030, although has provided little detail on how this would be achieved. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the goal was “reckless” as the cost of it has not been quantified. Vassallo said, “Australia could reach that 50% target, it just requires well-designed policies and markets that allow a transition from centralised, large-scale fossil fuels to efficient but variable renewables. “Storage is a key part to make that happen. The beauty of renewables is that once you’ve managed the capital cost, there is no fuel cost. There’s an energy security there you don’t get with fossil fuels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-06T13:00:21Z","webTitle":"The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment","fields":{"headline":"The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'","bodyText":"Debbie Dooley is a firebrand Republican and an outspoken founding member of the Tea Party. But in a fast-intensifying battle over the future of solar power in Florida, she is not on the side you might expect. Along with a diverse grassroots citizens’ coalition including environmentalists and other left-leaning activists, Dooley is taking on Big Energy and its big-spending conservative backers in an intriguing fight that puts her toe-to-toe with her onetime political allies. She is at the spearhead of a campaign to place an initiative before Florida voters next year that would give consumers the freedom to choose to buy their solar energy from smaller private companies and bypass the mega-bucks utilities. “It’s Florida’s solar eclipse,” says Dooley, who points to statistics she claims are proof that the Sunshine State is trailing the nation in utilising its most plentiful natural resource. If the initiative is successful, Florida would no longer be one of only four states that prohibits so-called third-party power purchase agreements (PPA), which, in basic terms, refer to a consumer allowing a company to install solar panels with no upfront cost, then paying the company for electricity that the panels generate. As things stand, only those who can afford the substantial initial outlay can power up from the sun, a situation Dooley says is unacceptable. With Florida 14th in the country in terms of installed solar capacity, only $63m was spent on new installations statewide in 2014, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “Let’s remove the barriers, remove the shackles that protect the monopolies and allow consumer choice and freedom,” said Dooley, whose Green Tea coalition of environmentally conscious conservatives is a key component of the Floridians for Solar Choice amalgam. Unsurprisingly, the big public power utilities don’t like the message being pushed by the activists as they tour the state attempting to collect the 683,000 signatures needed by February to get the initiative on November’s ballot. So companies including Florida Power and Light, Duke Energy, Tampa Electric and Gulf Power are among the donors who have ploughed millions of dollars into a rival group, Consumers for Smart Solar, which is promoting its own initiative that would enshrine in the state’s constitution their exclusive right to sell solar power. Their argument is that opening up the industry the way the citizens’ coalition wants would lead to less regulation and extra expense for traditional consumers in “subsidies” for the solar industry. As the duel has become more caustic in recent months, so have the attacks from rightwingers on Dooley, who has driven thousands of miles across Florida with her partner Jason to speak at rallies, lunches and other engagements in support of a new direction for solar power. Some have called her a fake conservative and say she has betrayed her Republican roots. Others have branded her eccentric and dismissed her travels as a solar-powered clown show as she “shills” for the industry. “I don’t worry about the attacks because I understand the political reality, which is they’re afraid of you,” Dooley told the Guardian after a recent speaking engagement before the League of Women Voters of Palm Beach County. “If you’re not being successful, they’re going to ignore you, so I’m really getting under someone’s skin. I have to laugh at that.” Back in 2009, feeling that the Republican party had “lost its way”, Dooley joined up with 21 like-minded supporters to give the Tea Party movement its first organised structure. “I was tired of politics as usual, tired of big money controlling everything,” she said, explaining why she became a director of the Tea Party Patriots. Now, she says, she finds it ironic that much of the criticism comes from rightwing groups who shared her beliefs, including the Koch brothers-funded American Legislative Exchange Council, but which take an opposite stance on clean energy. “True conservatives champion free-market choice, not government-created monopolies that stifle competition.” she said. “Trying to protect monopolies from competition is not free market. You should be bound by your principles and develop your position on issues based on your principles, not who your financial donors are.” The presence of Dooley, a pastor’s daughter from Bogalusa, Louisiana, in the midst of the Florida battle could prove to be a trump card, according to Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “Here in Florida, the political leadership is conservative, so having a voice like Debbie’s and others on the conservative side to be able to stand up for solar is very critical to the success of running this ballot initiative,” he said. Additionally, this is a conflict Dooley has fought and won before. She says the arguments in Florida, and the tactics employed, are similar to those that existed two years ago in Georgia, another red state wrestling with the solar power issue. Despite heavy opposition from the utilities there, and what she says was its $10m “war chest” against the organisation, Dooley’s grassroots coalition won the day, with a third-party solar bill clearing the legislature this April. “If you mentioned solar in Georgia, it was always, ‘No way, no how,’ but we won that fight with people power,” Dooley said. “We couldn’t match them in money, so we built a coalition, we got free media, we got our message out there. It was easier for us to get press coverage because people were amazed you had these conservative groups, Tea Party groups, the Sierra Club, elected officials, all joining forces to oppose this. “We all had different messages, the different groups, but we were working for the same goal. If we agree solar is the way to go, we come together and ignore issues we may disagree on while respecting the right of everyone to believe and advocate for them. But come together and stay focused. There are many different roads into Atlanta, where I live, and you make your choice depending on which direction you’re coming from. What matters is that you end up there.” Even as a little girl, Dooley refused to be put in a box. When her grandfather bought her a dress-up cowgirl costume as a Christmas gift when she was just seven, the self-confessed tomboy complained loudly. “I don’t want that. I don’t want be a cowgirl. I want a cowboy outfit,” Dooley recalls shouting at her relatives. “I was so upset, they took it right back and got me the cowboy outfit. They’d assumed because I was a girl that was what I wanted. But I was not afraid to challenge the norms.” Dooley says her early years following her father’s preachings in Louisiana, Tennessee and Florida helped to shape her political leanings and turned her into the driven character she is today at the age of 57. “I learned at a very early age to speak up and not be taken advantage of. I had no issue doing that,” she said. “My daddy prepared me well: he was strong, not afraid to take a step out, and I get a lot of my traits from him. “I will do what’s right and damn the torpedoes kind of thing. If you know a preacher’s kid, you know they can be rebellious. People have preconceived notions about you and you fight to show it’s not like that. You grow up tough, you grow up to be independent. “Any pastor will tell you, you can have 100 in your congregation and only a portion of them will be happy at any one time. You understand that not everyone will be happy; you just do your best and stand for what’s right.” Dooley, however, insists that taking a stand does not always have to be a politically charged move. “I became a crusader for solar and I’m appealing to conservatives, [but] I believe being good stewards of the environment God gave us should not be a partisan issue,” she says, pointing out that it was the ultra-conservative president Ronald Reagan who championed the 1987 Montreal Protocol that phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from aerosols to protect the ozone layer. “I believe in clean energy. I’ve always cared about clean air and a clean environment. I’ve always been like that,” she said. “I have a grandson, Aiden, who is seven. He’ll know I fought for energy choice and freedom, he’ll know I fought for a clean environment for him, so he wouldn’t have a polluted world. I see it is my legacy to him. “Unfortunately, the legacy of some of my fellow Republicans is that they simply denied that we were damaging our environment because they were greedy for economic reasons.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"States powering ahead on climate targets despite federal inaction, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","fields":{"headline":"States powering ahead on climate targets despite federal inaction, report shows","bodyText":"Australian states and territories are powering ahead, developing policies that will meet the federal government’s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets, with South Australia, the ACT and Tasmania leading the race. Despite being chastised by the federal government for unilateral action, South Australia is leading the race, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council. Compared on a series of measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since the Coalition government repealed the carbon tax in 2014. The federal government’s own projections show their policies will cause emissions to continue to rise for decades to come. But in the midst of the ongoing federal policy vacuum, every state and territory besides Western Australia has “gone it alone” and developed strong renewable energy and emissions reduction policies. South Australia leads the country with 47% of its electricity sourced from renewable sources, followed by the ACT at 22%. Tasmania sourced 92% of its electricity from renewable sources, but that was dominated by large-scale hydro electricity. The Northern Territory sourced just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources, sitting behind Western Australia and Queensland at 7%. Victoria sourced 12% from renewables while NSW sat at 17%. Queensland led the country when it comes to solar households, with 32% of homes having solar panels. That just pipped South Australia, which had 31%. While both Western Australia and the Northern Territory scored poorly on most measures, there appeared to be grassroots momentum there for solar rooftops, with the biggest increases in solar penetration over the past year happening in those states. Western Australia jumped almost three percentage points to more than 25% penetration, and the Northern Territory jumped 2.7 percentage points to 11.4% – a figure that was still the lowest in the country. The ACT and Tasmania had the strongest renewable energy targets, with the former aiming to implement a 100% target by 2020 and the latter by 2022. The ACT’s aggressive and bipartisan renewable energy policies delivered the lowest energy costs in the country for consumers. Every state except Western Australia and the Northern Territory had targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Those policies, combined with a surge in grassroots activity and market-driven closure of coal power plants, look set to easily cut Australia’s emissions by more 28% below 2005 levels, as Australia committed to following the Paris Agreement in 2015. That was the conclusion of a report by Frontier Economics earlier in the year, which concluded: “The commonwealth government will receive credit for state renewable policies that contribute to meeting the 2030 emissions target, while admonishing them for any energy security issues that may result. “Every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, is taking energy and climate policy into their own hands, with strong renewable energy targets or net zero emissions targets in place,” said Climate Council councillor and energy expert Andrew Stock. “States and territories previously lagging (NT, NSW and WA), are now stepping up the pace, joining the enormous progress we’re seeing across the nation,” he said. Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said Australians are embracing solar energy in droves, with more than 5.6GW generated on the rooftops of 1.7 million homes. “Australia is one of the sunniest countries in the world, so it’s no surprise we’ve already rolled out enough solar to power the lights at the MCG every day for 20,000 years,” he said. States leading the way without federal coordination was described as a “a messy dog’s breakfast” by the Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood, who went on to say the unilateral state action was “understandable with federal climate change inaction”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/offshore-wind-power-energy-price-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T09:50:30Z","webTitle":"Wind power is now cheaper than nuclear – the energy revolution is happening | John Sauven \r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/offshore-wind-power-energy-price-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/offshore-wind-power-energy-price-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Wind power is now cheaper than nuclear – the energy revolution is happening","bodyText":"In March I went to see Henrik Poulsen, the boss of Dong Energy, in Copenhagen. Never heard of him or his company? You are not alone, but the chances are he is keeping your lights on. The largely unknown story of his company is worth telling because it is genuinely revolutionary. Dong stands for Danish oil and natural gas. It was, like Shell and BP, involved in fossil fuel exploration and production. But in less than a decade it has become an 85% offshore wind company, and is divesting its coal, oil and gas interests. By 2023, Dong Energy will be very close to zero carbon. That is a pretty staggering transformation in a very short space of time. But it doesn’t end there. This isn’t just a hymn to the glory of an oil and gas company, it’s also a paean to the UK’s “greenest government ever”. Thanks to its support, the price of offshore wind energy has dropped by half in less than two years. By the 2020s, it will be as cheap or cheaper than any other form of power generation. It’s just become much cheaper than nuclear, even taking into account the additional costs associated with the wind’s intermittency. And in any case, this is less of an issue at sea where the winds are more constant. Talking to Poulsen made me realise that we were on the cusp of a quiet revolution. From being the most expensive form of renewable energy, offshore wind was fast becoming the cheapest form of large-scale, low-carbon generation bar none. As Poulsen said: “When you go 10 years into the future and you look back, I think we will look at these years, 2016, 2017, 2018, as the inflection point. I think we’ll look back and say wow … Something happened for wind and solar energy during those years that completely changed the dynamic.” But he also said that “without the UK government and what they have done for the past five or six years, we wouldn’t have been where we are today. I’m glad to see that it’s paying off because we’re creating a lot of jobs right now and building a local supply chain. So they’ll get their rewards, which they should.” There’s a pleasing symmetry in fighting climate change, a truly enormous problem that remains invisible to most people in the UK, with offshore wind, an equivalently huge and equally invisible solution. But I came away from that meeting thinking that this quiet revolution needed a bit of noise and visibility. Amid the gale of bad news that has blown through 2017, this was a good news story that needed shouting about from the rooftops. This month’s contracts for the next round of offshore wind farms to be built in the North Sea should have the champagne corks popping in No 10. They mean billions more in foreign investment coming into the UK. They will be playing a major role in regenerating regions in the north-east of the country. And they will create a thriving export market in contracts for offshore wind developments. But we at Greenpeace are not sure the government has noticed the full potential that their policies have created. To bring it to their attention, some of the world’s biggest players, including Vattenfall and General Electric, have come together alongside environmental organisations including WWF and the Marine Conservation Society. A campaign is being launched today at Westminster with the help of creative agency Mother, which is working pro bono. They explained to us that when you’re selling the future of energy generation at 50% off, all you really need to do is get this fact in front of your customers. MPs using Westminster tube station will find it hard to miss. The UK needs affordable and secure energy. We have to replace our obsolete power stations and meet growing demand from the electric vehicle revolution. Offshore wind, alongside a smart energy system including storage and interconnectors, should be the backbone of how the UK generates its power in future. Short term, as part of the transition, gas back up might be required (but only when needed, unless it’s green like biogas). Such a system could help us meet our climate change commitments and speed up the move to a low-carbon economy. It could provide jobs and regional regeneration as well as provide export markets. It could be the cheapest form of large-scale power available. It’s shown to be wildly popular in all opinion surveys. We urge the government to come clean on this issue and publicly admit that they got this right! • John Sauven is director of Greenpeace"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","fields":{"headline":"Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump","bodyText":"Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions, citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement. “One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet ‘geoengineering solves everything – we don’t have to bother about emissions.’ That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense,” Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin. Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as “just an engineering problem” – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This week’s conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. “All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts,” said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world’s poorest. “They also ignore the question as to why there’s not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction,” she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees. But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. “It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering,” Lawrence said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary.” Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life’s work evaporate. “At the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn’t do it,” he insisted. “Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn’t work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it’s there if we need it. But let’s say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say ‘abandon it’. That would be great. I’d love to publish that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/aug/13/mercedes-e-class-350d-amg-review-the-car-makers-really-cared","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-13T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Mercedes E-Class 350d AMG review: ‘The car makers really cared’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/mercedes-e-class-350d-amg-review-the-car-makers-really-cared","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/aug/13/mercedes-e-class-350d-amg-review-the-car-makers-really-cared","fields":{"headline":"Mercedes E-Class 350d AMG review: ‘The car makers really cared’","bodyText":"Price: £49,355 Top speed: 155mph 0-62mph: 5.9 seconds MPG: 54.3 CO2: 144g/km In my last Tour de France on day-to-day reporting duty for the Observer and Guardian, after 27 years on the job, I acquired a new interest in statistics. It is probably a good job that the Mercedes E-Class 350d AMG, which was this year’s Tour car, was the first I’d had with an onboard computer to deliver the brutal truth about the hours spent at the wheel, or I might have called time sooner. At the end of this year’s 28 days on the road I’d clocked up 4,800 miles and 112 hours’ driving. In other words, 28 hours per week. More than an entire day in every seven sitting in the same place: the driver’s seat of the car. It’s a rude awakening for many when I explain that covering the Tour comes down to a handy, if unromantic French rhyme: auto, boulot, dodo – car, work, sleep – and that disturbing stat confirmed what my instinct, and sore posterior, has told me in the past. Last year, I described how modern car-seat technology had made the Tour less of a pain in the rear end. Mercédès – I like to give Tour cars a name and figured if that was good enough for Alexandre Dumas it was fine for me and the voiture – had enough electronic ways of manipulating the seat to ensure a different position on each of the 28 days, though I never quite figured out how to make it provide a massage as the car manual seemed to promise it might (too busy putting in the hours at the wheel to do the reading). There were other stats to scroll through in the many hours spent watching the autoroute whizz towards me (€200 in tolls along the way). For those 4,800 miles, we managed 48 miles per gallon, not unreasonable given the amount of mountain driving using the Sport setting. On one stage out of the mountains (Salon de Provence), on the Eco setting which tells the car to coast on any downhill, it hit 52mpg. Not surprisingly though, Mercédès felt most at home on the autobahn of her native Germany, where the Tour began. There was much technology: my favourite was the delightfully gentle reading light, which was bright enough but far from dazzling, making you feel like the car makers really cared; my least-loved was the slightly bewildering five levers on the steering column. In Provence (fortunately in an entirely private parking lot) I discovered the flipside of the key-less ignition, however: if totally knackered and work-absorbed, you can leave the extremely quiet (and happily very economical) engine running for four hours, while typing obliviously 150 yards away. On Tour, the more thought processes are taken away from you, the more grateful you feel. I was thankful indeed. This year’s revelation was Active Distance Assist, basically the car slowing automatically in cruise control when it thinks something might be getting in the way. Much of the Tour day boiled down to: turn on the autoroute, engage cruise, point and trust, in which you feel like a pilot trying fly by wire for the first time. Plus, a tie-in with the satnav told it to slow down when the speed limit changed. The main lesson of 26 Tours in 26 very different cars? Few objects absorb as much solar energy as a vehicle parked outside a Tour press centre. That brain melting heat should be harnessed in ways other than merely baking the contents before you put the aircon on. Not even Mercédès had an answer to this one, although given the ingenuity on display throughout the 350 I’m sure it’s only a matter of time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T18:24:46Z","webTitle":"I will return Saudi Arabia to moderate Islam, says crown prince","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince","fields":{"headline":"I will return Saudi Arabia to moderate Islam, says crown prince","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has vowed to return the country to “moderate Islam” and asked for global support to transform the hardline kingdom into an open society that empowers citizens and lures investors. In an interview with the Guardian, the powerful heir to the Saudi throne said the ultra-conservative state had been “not normal” for the past 30 years, blaming rigid doctrines that have governed society in a reaction to the Iranian revolution, which successive leaders “didn’t know how to deal with”. Expanding on comments he made at an investment conference at which he announced the launch of an ambitious $500bn (£381bn) independent economic zone straddling Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt, Prince Mohammed said: “We are a G20 country. One of the biggest world economies. We’re in the middle of three continents. Changing Saudi Arabia for the better means helping the region and changing the world. So this is what we are trying to do here. And we hope we get support from everyone. “What happened in the last 30 years is not Saudi Arabia. What happened in the region in the last 30 years is not the Middle East. After the Iranian revolution in 1979, people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it.” Earlier Prince Mohammed had said: “We are simply reverting to what we followed – a moderate Islam open to the world and all religions. 70% of the Saudis are younger than 30, honestly we won’t waste 30 years of our life combating extremist thoughts, we will destroy them now and immediately.” The crown prince’s comments are the most emphatic he has made during a six-month reform programme that has tabled cultural reforms and economic incentives unimaginable during recent decades, during which the kingdom has been accused of promoting a brand of Islam that underwrote extremism. The comments were made as the heir of the incumbent monarch moves to consolidate his authority, sidelining clerics whom he believes have failed to support him and demanding unquestioning loyalty from senior officials whom he has entrusted to drive a 15-year reform programme that aims to overhaul most aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. Central to the reforms has been the breaking of an alliance between hardline clerics who have long defined the national character and the House of Saud, which has run affairs of state. The changes have tackled head-on societal taboos such as the recently rescinded ban on women driving, as well as scaling back guardianship laws that restrict women’s roles and establishing an Islamic centre tasked with certifying the sayings of the prophet Muhammed. The scale and scope of the reforms has been unprecedented in the country’s modern history and concerns remain that a deeply conservative base will oppose what is effectively a cultural revolution – and that the kingdom lacks the capacity to follow through on its economic ambitions. The new economic zone is to be established on 470km of the Red Sea coast, in a tourist area that has already been earmarked as a liberal hub akin to Dubai, where male and female bathers are free to mingle. It has been unveiled as the centrepiece of efforts to turn the kingdom away from a near total dependence on oil and into a diverse open economy. Obstacles remain: an entrenched poor work ethic, a crippling regulatory environment and a general reluctance to change. “Economic transformation is important but equally essential is social transformation,” said one of the country’s leading businessmen. “You cannot achieve one without the other. The speed of social transformation is key. It has to be manageable.” Alcohol, cinemas and theatres are still banned in the kingdom and mingling between unrelated men and women remains frowned upon. However Saudi Arabia – an absolute monarchy – has clipped the wings of the once-feared religious police, who no longer have powers to arrest and are seen to be falling in line with the new regime. Economically Saudi Arabia will need huge resources if it is to succeed in putting its economy on a new footing and its leadership believes it will fail to generate strategic investments if it does not also table broad social reforms. Prince Mohammed had repeatedly insisted that without establishing a new social contract between citizen and state, economic rehabilitation would fail. “This is about giving kids a social life,” said a senior Saudi royal figure. “Entertainment needs to be an option for them. They are bored and resentful. A woman needs to be able to drive herself to work. Without that we are all doomed. Everyone knows that – except the people in small towns. But they will learn.” In the next 10 years, at least five million Saudis are likely to enter the country’s workforce, posing a huge problem for officials who currently do not have jobs to offer them or tangible plans to generate employment.

And it starts with water","bodyText":"It’s easy for all concerned about air, water and nature to descend into despair as we watch brazen rollbacks of environmental legislation in the US. Just last week, developments included an executive order to rewrite US carbon emissions rules, jeopardising the country’s ability to uphold its Paris climate talk commitment; the end of a moratorium on new coal leases; and the green-lighting of a pesticide claimed to cause harm to children. But as apathy is not an option, let’s try to think beyond the usual strategies. For one, we can recognise that the way we talk about our environmental challenges has interfered with our ability to truly grapple with them: that we limit ourselves by creating too simple a story. Specifically, the story we tell about climate. Now I’m not speaking of climate-change denial. For at this juncture, with wild temperature swings and record-breaking weather becoming the norm, outright denial amounts to a kind of temper tantrum, a primitive railing against the inconvenience and indignity of elemental change. Rather, I mean the way that we understand climate change, the story we tell ourselves. In a popular TED talk, Nigerian-born author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie introduced the concept of the “single story”: the tendency to uncritically embrace received wisdom. While she referenced social and ethnic narratives, the “single story”, and its inherent risks of limiting perspective, applies to other beliefs as well. By shifting to a more complex, multifaceted story we can envision solutions that better reflect the realities of climate and how the natural world processes heat. Our characterisation of climate change – the “single story” – is this: “Climate change is global warming caused by too much CO2 in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. We stop climate change by making the transition to renewable energy.” This is certainly a key aspect of the story, and we absolutely need to shift away from fossil fuels … like, 20 years ago. But there are several problems with this narrative. One is the uncomfortable fact that even if, by some miracle, we could immediately cut emissions to zero, due to inertia in the system it would take more than a century for CO2 levels to drop to 350 parts per million, which is considered the safe threshold. Plus, here’s what we don’t talk about when we talk about climate: we can all go solar and drive electric cars and still have the problems – the unprecedented heat waves, the wacky weather – that we now associate with CO2-driven climate change. Climate is not a function of one sole metric; it is not a single story. And this is where we find opportunities. When faced with an environmental predicament, it can be useful to inquire as to how nature has approached similar scenarios. For instance, in the case of wildfire, one can ask what processes used to keep that landscape hydrated and therefore resilient to fire. We learn that in the American west, beavers created wetlands and acted as “shock absorbers” that minimised fire risks. And when we ask what maintains our climate, the answer is water. Were it not for the blanket of water vapour that buffers the Earth, our planet would be too cold to inhabit. The phase changes of water – from solid to liquid to gas, and back – represent an extraordinary transfer of heat. According to Australian microbiologist Walter Jehne, water-based processes in the atmosphere and the oceans, over land and across ice, govern some 95% of Earth’s natural heat dynamics. It is the sheer immensity of water’s role in climate that led scientists to conclude that humans could not have interfered with it. And yet, once we understand how water works – and how water intersects with factors we can influence, such as land use and plant cover – we can help to restore the processes that sustain the heat and energy balance, and therefore sustain our climate. Water doesn’t move and transfigure on its own: much of its movement is determined by biology, particularly by plants. Consider transpiration, in which plants draw up water and release it as vapour. This is a cooling mechanism, as it consumes and dissipates heat from the sun. According to Czech botanist Jan Pokorný, on a sunny day a good-sized tree may transpire more than 100 litres (21 gallons) of water – a process that represents three times the cooling power of an airconditioning system in a five-star hotel room. Brazilian scientist Antonio Donato Nobre says that collectively, the trees of the Amazon rainforest create a “vertical river” even greater than the Amazon river itself. This is moisture in motion, embodying and conveying heat. The “single story” has been that climate change will affect the availability of water. The more complex – and complete – story is that water can also have an effect on climate. And that this is activated by plants. Peter Andrews, a farmer and author in Australia, made a statement that has stuck with me: “Plants manage water. And in managing water, they manage heat.” Worth noting: we have de-vegetated a quarter of the planet – including destroying most of our natural forests. When we talk about “energy”, certainly in terms of policy, we usually mean what fuels our cars and heats our homes. Let’s look at energy in a very basic sense, as in what happens when sunlight meets the ground. Say you have pavement, or land marked by degraded, exposed soil – the condition of much of the world’s surface. When the sun beams down on that bare soil, solar energy is absorbed; it becomes sensible heat, or heat you can feel. Now amble over to a nice meadow, or well-managed rangeland with a thick carpet of grasses. Here solar energy touches down on plants that are transpiring. The solar heat is dispersed and becomes latent heat, embodied in water vapour, to be condensed and released as rain. There is nothing magic about any of this: throughout human history – the climatically benign period known as the Holocene – climate moderation has derived from functioning ecosystems. The important thing to realise is that we can restore ecosystems, these environments that have nurtured and sustained us, and bring heat and water dynamics back into balance. Because natural processes are so entwined, every step toward regeneration brings multiple co-benefits: more plants mean more photosynthesis, which means more carbon pulled from the atmosphere into the soil, where it adds fertility; every 1% increase in soil organic carbon represents an additional 250,000 litres per hectare that can be held on the land; the more water held on the land, the greater resilience to floods and drought. Here’s another climate subplot worth mulling over: Walter Jehne points out that based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, every square metre of Earth’s surface receives an average of 342 watts of solar energy a day. Because of how humans have altered the environment, we now radiate back about 339 watts per square metre – a difference of less than 1%. If we managed our ecology better, how might we make up that three-watt differential? How about if we had a lot more plant cover and a lot less bare ground? One challenge to reckoning with climate change is that despite all the weather anomalies we’ve been seeing, it’s difficult to confidently link climate change to any one event. This perpetuates the notion that climate change is an abstraction to be pushed off into the future, and leads to cognitive dissonance in that it seems impossible to “prove” what we know to be so. Let me now introduce an alternate definition of climate change: “manifestations of distorted carbon, water and energy cycles”. That doesn’t negate the single story of fossil fuel-borne carbon but broadens it in a way that creates opportunities beyond fighting fossil fuel interests. At this moment of reckless distraction and denial, it is crucial to find meaningful paths forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/02/anglican-church-queensland-carmichael-mine-heartland-divest-fossil-fuels-australia-adani","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-01T20:12:18Z","webTitle":"Anglican church in Carmichael mine heartland to divest from fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/02/anglican-church-queensland-carmichael-mine-heartland-divest-fossil-fuels-australia-adani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/02/anglican-church-queensland-carmichael-mine-heartland-divest-fossil-fuels-australia-adani","fields":{"headline":"Anglican church in Carmichael mine heartland to divest from fossil fuels","bodyText":"The Anglican church in Australia’s largest coalmining region, including the site of Adani’s proposed Carmichael mine, has vowed to renounce interests in fossil fuels. The Anglican diocese of Rockhampton, which includes central Queensland mining and gas towns across 20 parishes – the largest of which is bigger than Victoria – voted to divest from the likes of thermal coal and coal seam gas at a synod meeting on 20 May. A group of about 70 priests and church representatives passed two motions committing the church to ethical investments, a criteria which puts fossil fuels in the same category as arms dealing, tobacco, alcohol and gambling, wage exploitation and pornography. That position likely leaves scope to retain interests in coking coal for steel but focuses on renewables for energy investments. Lindsay Howie, the dean of St Paul’s cathedral in Rockhampton, said the diocese’s investments were “pretty much bugger all compared to the rest of the world”. “Nevertheless, we’re encouraging Christians to exercise responsibility in terms of where they put their investments and to think seriously about wind energy and solar energy,” he said. “That’s where we’d like it to be going.” The Rockhampton diocese, which takes in Gladstone, Moranbah and Clermont – the closest town to Adani’s proposed site for Australia’s largest coalmine in the Galilee Basin – includes a population of about 48,000 people who identify as Anglican. The motion called for scrapping investments in companies “significantly involved in or deriving more than 25% of their annual income” from “polluting the atmosphere, soil or water resources [or] the production or use of fossil fuels”. It also renounces investments in armaments, gambling, tobacco, liquor, x-rated imagery and industries that unfairly exploit employees or the disadvantaged. Howie said the motions were “very broad but really it’s about exercising social responsibility”. He said “one of the great areas of concern” locally was that mining development of the Galilee Basin represented the permanent scarification of “some of the most beautiful and productive agricultural land we have in Queensland”. “That’s to say nothing of the Indigenous perspective in terms of the sacredness of that particular land,” Howie said. “If you’ve been into Moura, Moranbah, Dysart, there are huge spoil heaps, the overburden, sitting slap-bang on what used to be incredibly productive land. “One of the problems with it now is they’ve tried to do the reclamation and, try as they might, it’ll take a million years for that land to ever be productive again because it’s full of heavy minerals and metals and acids. “What we’re going to end up with in terms of the whole Galilee Basin is a scar from Rolleston to Springsure, 100km wide, for about 500 to 600km. “It’s just a staggering invasion of some of the most productive agricultural land in Queensland.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/may/30/outsourcing-it-poses-risks-in-britain-and-in-india","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T18:31:41Z","webTitle":"Outsourcing IT poses risks in Britain and in India | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/30/outsourcing-it-poses-risks-in-britain-and-in-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/may/30/outsourcing-it-poses-risks-in-britain-and-in-india","fields":{"headline":"Outsourcing IT poses risks in Britain and in India","bodyText":"British Airways and many other businesses have offshored electricity-dependent functions like IT services and call centres to northern India (BA chief refuses to resign after ‘catastrophic’ IT failure, 30 May). Increasingly this is a region in the grip of extended droughts and annual heatwaves associated with record-breaking temperatures that scientists say will only get worse with climate change. Catastrophic electricity system failures are exacerbated by heat-triggered thunderstorms and regional outages resulting from the air-conditioning-related energy demand spikes that are common in India. In July 2012 power failed for 600 million people in northern India in the biggest blackout in history. It is rather surprising that business continuity planners allow their clients to relocate energy and water-hungry operations to such climate-challenged regions. British Airways’ Indian HQ is located in a tall glass tower with no opening windows in the New Delhi satellite city of Gurgaon. Once the limited backup power supplies are exhausted in such buildings they have to be evacuated. One simple solution is to design buildings very differently with sensibly sized and shaded opening windows, powered by solar energy. Another is to onshore electricity-hungry operations back to cooler Britain. I expect the business continuity community are re-evaluating their “future-proofing” strategies as I write.

Norway's fossil-free energy startups","bodyText":"Øyvind Christian Rohn spent more than two decades in the oil and gas industry. But the 50-year-old from Skedsmo, near Oslo in Norway, has just set out on a new fossil-free career path: developing offshore solar power technology. An alternative energy startup Ocean Sun, that he co-founded, has developed technology that will mean solar farms can float on the ocean surface, with their power transmitted back to land. Since physical space is limited in population centres, especially in areas of high growth such as South East Asia, its idea is to use the ocean’s surface around the world. With a grant from Innovation Norway, a state-funded organisation supporting the development of Norwegian industry, the company is aiming to get a product to market within four years. Rohn is one of a new brand of Norwegian entrepreneurs moving from oil to green energy in light of the oil-price decline and more pessimistic outlook for the sector. Though still tiny at less than 1% of Norway’s power generation, according to the agency Multiconsult, the country’s solar sector is growing fast. Solar panel installation grew by 366% in 2016. “We see solar becoming the long-term solution for the world because it is abundant energy and costs have gone down rapidly,” says Rohn. Wake-up call Norway already produces a lot of renewable energy – 97% of electricity generated in the country comes from renewable sources, mainly hydropower, according to Innovation Norway. But when it comes to the economy, petrochemicals are still king: about half of Norway’s exports relate to oil and gas. The decline in revenues from crude oil – which dropped by more than 30% between 2014 and 2015, according to Norway’s statistics agency – was therefore a wake-up call, says Sigridur Thormodsdottir, a sustainability expert at Innovation Norway. “It revealed our economy was not sustainable in the long run. New technology supporting more sustainable urbanisation is one area we think can become an export for Norwegian companies.” The government clearly agrees. Since 2014, it has launched a number of “clusters” promoting startup innovation, including a new solar energy cluster, launched last year with three years of funding. Young start-ups, who have joined the clusters of companies and agencies working together, include wave power firm Tidetec, hydrogen technology firm Hynor Lillestrøm, solar powered-devices company Kyoto Energy and DeepRiver, which aims to generate hydropower from rivers. Major fossil fuel companies are also investing in renewables. Statoil, for example, established as the Norwegian State Oil Company is testing floating wind turbines technology off the country’s coast. Mali Skoden is director of the Oslo Renewable Energy and Environment Cluster (OREEC), a similar networking initiative to the government clusters, created with regional companies and other partners. She says lower oil prices and awareness of climate change are providing opportunities. “Much of our economy depends on the oil and gas industry, which is declining. A lot of engineers and bright minds from that industry are looking for jobs so we can channel that brain power into new sectors of green energy.” As part of this, solar is getting a lot of attention, says Trine Kopstad Berentsen, chief executive of the solar energy cluster in Norway. The municipal council in Oslo is offering individual householders a subsidy of 30% of the investment for solar panel installation, for example, she says. Culture change Cost is not the only obstacle, however, adds Berentsen: “The biggest challenge for Norway ... is conservatism in the energy sector.” This is echoed by Glen Peters, senior researcher at the Oslo-based Centre for International Climate Research, who says that not everyone wants to pivot to greener power. “Oil and gas has made Norway what it is, a lot of people have worked [in the sector] directly and indirectly, and it’s almost part of the culture. It’s hard to lift out and see other opportunities,” he says. Rohn believes that Norway’s renewables sector will coexist with petrochemicals for the foreseeable future. “I haven’t had any negative feedback. People think it’s quite brave, of course, to start up something from scratch after having worked for such big organisations before but generally there’s no conflict. “People who work in oil and gas think their contribution will be to make sure that they develop oil and gas in the best possible way to minimise environmental change, and that they can do that better here in Norway,” he says. “I believe we have to change.” Sign up to be a Guardian Sustainable Business member and get more stories like this direct to your inbox every week.

The entire Dodecanese island is a nature reserve, with more than 150 species of resident and migratory birds, over 650 plant varieties, and a permanent population hovering around 500. Tilos owes its extraordinary biodiversity to a network of underground springs that feed five wetlands – but also to the late mayor, Tassos Aliferis, a committed environmentalist who earned Tilos its reputation as “Greece’s green island”. Aliferis banned hunting in 1993. (He also conducted the first same-sex marriages in Greece in 2008 long before they became legal in 2015.) The current mayor, Maria Kamma, continues to champion sustainable development, and human rights. She has extended an open invitation to refugee families to settle on Tilos, working with the NGO SolidarityNow and the UNHCR to establish sheltered accommodation, language classes and mentoring schemes to help asylum-seekers set up organic farming businesses in partnership with locals. “We want to revive traditions that were dying out due to a dwindling population, like making cheese and gathering medicinal herbs,” says Kamma. “By integrating refugees, we can boost the local economy and encourage eco-tourism.” Soon Tilos could become even greener: it’s set to be the first island in the Mediterranean powered by wind and solar energy. The island currently relies on oil-based electricity from neighbouring Kos, via a submarine cable that is vulnerable to faults. Power cuts are frequent. By installing a single wind turbine and small photovoltaic park, Tilos is creating a hybrid micro-grid that will generate and store energy. Installation is under way and an 18-month pilot begins in September, as part of a €15m project largely funded by the European commission. Eventually, Tilos could export excess power to Kos, and the goal is to roll out similar projects on other small islands in Europe. Financial support has also been provided for Tilos Park, a non-profit residents’ association set up to protect and promote the island’s natural and cultural heritage, and upgrade the Information Centre, where visitors can pick up maps of nature trails, mountain bike routes, and the best spots for sighting rare birds, or sign up for canoe and kayak trips. It’s hoped that knock-on effects will include increased visitor numbers – which currently stand at 13,000 per year – particularly among eco-minded travellers. “Tilos has many loyal ‘fans’ who’ve come every year for 30 years,” says Kamma. “Now we’re getting a lot more interest from young people who have heard about Tilos because of the renewable energy project. They like what we are doing and want to support the island.” Kamma also hopes the positive publicity will help generate additional funding to install solar-powered street lighting, introduce electric bicycles and motorbikes for municipal staff, and charging stations for electric cars. “Usually it’s hard for a tiny island community to break with tradition, but on Tilos we’ve always welcomed alternatives,” she says. “If we can do it, anyone can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-28T13:03:32Z","webTitle":"Is Hillary Clinton's ambitious solar energy goal for the US workable? | Karl Mathiesen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","fields":{"headline":"Is Hillary Clinton's ambitious solar energy goal for the US workable?","bodyText":"On Sunday, Hillary Clinton took a first swing at the many-headed carbon hydra. By the end of her first term, she said, the US would have seven times more solar energy capacity than it does today. And by 2027, renewable energy would supply a third of the nation’s electricity. Clinton’s announcement, which the campaign said would be the first of many on climate change from the presidential hopeful, extends the carbon-saving ambition in a significant sector of the economy. Burning fossil fuels for electricity accounts for 31% of US greenhouse gas emissions. One estimate found Clinton’s 33% renewable target could slice another 4% off the US’s existing pledge to cut emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Americas chief, Ethan Zindler, said the ambition was high, but within reach. “It appears to be on the upper end but it’s entirely doable given the rapidly improving economics of renewables generally and solar particularly.” The momentum is already swinging towards low carbon electricity. Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, due for activation in August, is predicted to push the renewable sector from its current 13% share of the electricity market to 25% by 2027. In 2015, solar photovoltaic installations are forecast to rise by 27%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). This rise has been aided by the soon-to-expire solar investment tax credit (ITC), which the industry said Clinton will have to revive. “Clinton’s ambitious goal for solar is only possible if solar continues its impressive trajectory. SEIA is working to extend the solar ITC and remove statewide barriers that inhibit the growth of solar,” said SEIA president and CEO, Rhone Resch. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Clinton noted that further federal investment would be needed to incentivise the sector’s push to 33%. In a fact sheet, the campaign flagged the resuscitation of tax credits and some innovation and regulatory incentives. “That [the return of tax credits] is hardly a sure thing, given that at least one chamber of Congress will inevitably be Republican controlled during at least the first two years of any new president’s term,” said Zindler. Jürgen Weiss, head of climate change at the Brattle Group consultancy, said incentives were important as the industry remained relatively tiny, with low public awareness. A large percentage of costs for installers of residential solar are wrapped up in selling the technology to a sceptical public who have relatively low electricity costs and little concern for climate change. “The big part is convincing people to sign up in the first place. People in the US may care less about climate change than they do about cost,” he said. Although the technology, regulatory and labour costs are roughly similar, the price of installing residential solar in Germany (where high electricity costs, strong public acceptance and large government incentives have driven a huge push to solar) is around $1.50 (£1) per watt cheaper than in the US. Even if half of Clinton’s target of 140GW of solar by 2021 were to come from residential (as opposed to utility) solar panels, that equates to a cost difference of more than $100bn, mostly spent on advertising and sales. John Reilly, an energy economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the targets would be a challenge “in terms of providing incentives to build that much”. Weiss said: “I do think those costs will come down as the market matures and people get more informed.” The danger, he said, was providing too much tax-payer funded incentive early on. In Germany and the UK, the solar industry has come under political pressure for being too successful when subsidies were high and now suffers from accusations of being a ‘subsidy junky’. It’s important to clear up some ambiguity in the Clinton rhetoric. From her renewables campaign video, “a 10-year goal of generating enough renewable energy to power every single home in America” does not mean every home is going to have its own clean energy supply. The residential sector uses roughly a third of the total electricity generated. So a 33% renewable goal means the country will be generating this much clean energy, but not all of it will end up in homes. But factories and office buildings don’t vote and the promise, as my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg points out, allows Clinton to sound like she’s liberating bill payers from utilities. It is also clear that Clinton’s focus on solar (as opposed to wind) is aimed at the voting bill payer. Solar even garners support among some Republicans because of the freedom it offers from regulation and bills. But the other side of the clean power revolution might be justified in feeling a little left out by Clinton’s policy announcement. Wind energy is by far the big brother to solar. In 2014, wind generated 4.4% of the country’s electricity compared with 0.4% from the sun. In Iowa, where Clinton made her announcement, wind’s share is more than a quarter. It’s cheaper than solar, although the gap is narrowing, and the nation’s first offshore wind farm began construction on Monday. “Recent cost declines have made wind energy the lowest-cost zero carbon solution, and one of the lowest cost generation options overall. As a result ... wind will account for the majority of all generation additions going forward,” said the American Wind Energy Association’s Rob Gramlich. The Department of Energy has found that wind energy can affordably reach 20% of electricity generation by 2030. And, under Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts it will be the biggest contributor of new renewable capacity throughout the 2020s. As part of her announcement, Clinton pledged to uphold the Obama administration’s heavily-opposed restrictions on the carbon emissions of power stations, which are expected to accelerate the already rapid shut-down of coal plants across the country. This capacity will mostly be taken up by cheap gas, but there will be space for renewables if they can compete. Alex Trembath, a senior analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, said: “Action on carbon emissions will largely come by making clean energy cheap, as opposed to making dirty energy more expensive, for a variety of reasons.” The boost to renewables raises important questions about the ability of the grid, which is built to carry power from continuously-burning large power stations rather than millions of diffuse and variable solar panels, to handle such high levels of variable electricity supply. Reilly said the 33% target was achievable. “If we did build that much, then in terms of the grid we would likely have a lot of spare capacity sitting around, so it would be possible to balance it out. The challenge as time goes by and that capacity retires is whether the back-up capacity is actually built,” he said. But Weiss said the likely reality of a renewables explosion would not be uniform: “Average 33% across the country is a different story from having a 70% renewable share in some places and a 10% renewable share someplace else.” Going beyond 33% is when things get really tough for the grid. A study Reilly authored in 2012 estimated that reaching 80% renewable generation would add around 40% to the cost of electricity. Jesse Jenkins and Trembath recently suggested that reaching levels of variable renewables above their ‘capacity factor’ becomes increasingly expensive. Capacity factor is the amount of time your source actually spends generating electricity - for wind 25-35% and solar 10-20%. So going above a third of the market is where the heavy lifting really begins. This would ramp up the costs of preparing the grid for new types of generation, which the Clinton campaign flagged as a spending priority. Weiss estimated this could cost in the range of $100bn over the next 10-15 years, roughly a 5-10% increase on current electricity spending. “My main issue with her target is that it is narrowly constrained to solar,” said Trembath. “The biggest omission I continue to see from Democrats is support for nuclear power, which needs federal support in different ways than most renewable energy technologies do.” In total, Clinton’s pledge will push the zero carbon electricity sector (including nuclear) from 32% today, to about 50% in 2027. Any credible economy-wide climate scheme will need to encompass a great swathe of measures to reduce carbon, said Zindler. “There are other means for lowering CO2 emissions in the US. Our comparatively profligate use of gasoline has been one area of focus and average consumer vehicle fuel efficiency has actually been rising in the US in recent years. More improvements in transport are definitely possible, particularly in the area of trucks. More efficient use of electricity in homes and businesses is also an area that clearly offers opportunities that do not even necessarily need to be policy driven as they offer consumers the opportunity to save money,” he said.

A transition to a new energy economy is happening. In a country like Australia – awash with energy both under and above the ground – this transition could be rapid and profound. There is a lot to lose for those who can’t keep pace. Last month the government committed $1bn to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. The fund will have “the primary purpose of earning income or a profitable return” on debt and equity extended to renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. While many will argue the right way for that money to be used, investment like this is well timed. There are a number of converging technologies driving the transition. Their interaction will affect how we travel, how we live, the way our cities and houses are designed, our fuel supply and attitude to energy efficiency, and even how we interact. One of the maturing technologies is solar. Over the past five years, solar has become a big part of our energy world. The Australian energy market operator estimated last year that by 2023/24 the state of South Australia may, at times, have its entire electricity needs met by solar systems on mostly urban rooftops, without the aid of coal, gas or oil. Together with other renewables, photovoltaics are becoming increasingly competitive. Factoring in the cost of delivering energy through the grid, photovoltaic technology is probably the cheapest electricity supply option at the point of use right now. And it will continue to get cheaper. Another is energy storage. Improvements in battery technology and cost will help overcome the intermittency of renewable energy. Tesla’s push into the consumer mass market is just the beginning of a decade in which electric cars will become significantly more common and at the heart of each electric vehicle is a battery that can store enough electricity to serve the average Australian home for days. Our cars will act as mobile batteries that “plug in” to the home, allowing their energy to be used for household purposes. Batteries will also be installed in our homes, complementing our rooftop solar. Utilities will use them to optimise their grids. This new energy landscape will be more complex, requiring interaction between energy providers and users like never before. Controlling this will be the energy “internet”, a vast array of interconnected devices that will produce, store or use energy. These devices will communicate their energy deficits and surpluses and transport energy to where it is needed most, as well as allowing consumers to remotely control their devices to optimise energy usage. This capability will allow a range of new energy technologies and business models to emerge. Consumers will have more say in what energy they use and how, and by digitally understanding those needs suppliers will be able to optimise their services to align. Another technology reaching maturity is the “smart” energy grid. Despite the self-sufficiency potential of renewable energy, the grid will not become obsolete. Pole and wire infrastructure will allow users to upload and download energy to maximise cost effectiveness and reliability – like off-peak hot water is used now but much more complex. As energy utilisation is automised, unintentional consumption will fall. As with any fundamental disruption, there will be winners and losers. Foreseeing and harnessing the potential of the convergence won’t be easy for incumbents or new entrants. Significant investment will be required to develop and commercialise businesses and technology capable of harnessing the possibilities of convergence. But the potential pay-off for businesses that get it right will be huge. There will be other benefits as well. Until now, I have barely mentioned emissions. The energy transition is happening without reference to its environmental value. And yet, there are environment-related drivers. The final, published agreement from COP21, the climate change-related Conference of Parties 21 held in Paris last December, aims for essentially zero net emissions by 2050, the world over. Why are governments the world over suddenly willing to agree to such ambitious targets? The scientific consensus to act on climate has strengthened, for one. But pragmatic governments may also be seeing signs of tangible, real solutions emerging in energy markets. The timetable outlined in Paris for emissions reductions appears to align well with the published convergence of technologies – very roughly in the next 10 or so years. This, of course, could just be a coincidence but, if so, it is well timed. Decarbonisation of the global economy now has a route that is starting to make commercial sense. Coal, oil and gas will continue as primary energy supplies for some time and simply being more efficient with our energy use is the first way to reduce emissions. As technology converges, we won’t need to be convinced that we should consider the environment: we will be too busy focusing on the economic benefits.

But the two sources of renewable energy are far from getting equal love from corporate America. Wind energy has long been the favorite. Businesses, not counting power companies, signed 2,000 megawatts of it in 2015, a jump from 100 megawatts in 2009, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Wind energy is enabling Google, the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity in the world, to hit the 100% renewable energy goal, which it expects to achieve next year. The company has inked 2,548 megawatts of wind contracts and 141 megawatts of solar from projects around the world. Interest in solar energy is growing, but at a slower rate. Solar contracts shot up to 1,070 megawatts in 2015 from 339 megawatts in 2010, said the Solar Energy Industries Association. Wind energy has historically been much cheaper than solar, making it a more attractive option, especially when energy can be a major expense for a company. As more businesses come under pressure from their customers, investors or government regulators to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and help rein in global warming, they will be looking for low-carbon energy that can compete with the price of coal and natural gas. Wind and solar are not the only sources of electricity with lower carbon footprints than coal and natural gas. Hydropower and nuclear are too, and, unlike solar and wind, are able to produce electricity any time. But hydropower plants require access to ample sources of surface water. A nuclear power plant can take longer to secure permits and cost more than building other types of power plants. “Corporate participation (in buying solar and wind) is still relatively new,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, which recently announced the biggest wind energy contract, at 178 megawatts, in its renewable energy portfolio. “It’s only within the last few years that we’ve seen an uptick, and we’ve yet to fully address the challenges in expanding this market.” A head start America pioneered early research and development of commercial turbines, installing the world’s first wind farm in 1980 and leading the amount of installations, in megawatts, until the late 1990s, when Germany and eventually China began to catch up and then slowly push ahead. Solar hasn’t experienced the same long term and consistent investments and construction, which help to lower cost. Wind power costs cratered 66% in the last six years, said the American Wind Energy Association. The lowest price for a wind contract is around $0.02 per kilowatt-hour while it’s $0.03 for solar, said Ryan Wiser, a renewable energy market researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. That minor difference in price can add up to a hefty bill for heavy users of electricity, such as data centers that require an around-the-clock electricity supply. More than half of the 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy contracts last year, and 3,440 megawatts this year, were signed by companies across industries from tech to grocery chains, according to the wind trade association and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Utilities bought the rest. Amazon, for example, has invested more in wind and solar in the past two years. It’s paying for power from a 150-megawatt wind farm in Indiana and waiting for a 208-megawatt wind project in North Carolina to come online soon. It’s also signed agreements for several hundred megawatts of new wind energy that are scheduled to start delivery in 2017. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dow Chemical and 3M are buying five times more wind than solar, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Why solar is playing catch-up Solar has become an increasingly attractive option following a massive construction of factories to build solar panels, mostly notably in China. Prices for solar contracts have dived 63% over the last five years, said the solar trade association. In the 2016 ranking of top corporate solar energy buyers, Target gets the top spot with 147.5 megawatts of installed capacity, according to the solar trade association. The retailer is followed by industrial real estate developer Prologis (107.8 megawatts), Apple (93.9 megawatts), Costco (50.7 megawatts) and Kohl’s (50.2 megawatts). Businesses looking to sign renewable energy contracts or even develop their own solar or wind projects often find themselves on a steep learning curve about borrowing money, structuring contracts and understanding the complex rules that govern the electric industry. Getting rid of these road blocks will encourage more companies to lower their use of fossil fuel energy, business leaders said. For a company that operates in many states or even countries, figuring out a way to standardize renewable energy contracts helps it to save money and time, Janous said. “How do we make deals more attainable for not just Microsoft but smaller companies? There has to be some simplification,” he added. In cities where the local power companies don’t offer much, if any, wind or solar energy for sale, businesses could install their own solar panels or wind turbines on their properties. The cost of this do-it-yourself model has historically been higher than paying for electricity supplied by the local utilities, noted Herve Touati, managing director of Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewable Center. But that cost is coming down and, in some cases, lower than the electricity from the grid. “It’s cheaper for Microsoft to use onsite generation than ask utilities to double their existing grids,” Touati said. Companies with renewable energy contracts or a stake in a solar or wind farm typically don’t use that low-carbon electricity directly – electricity from power plants of all types usually enters the transmission lines and gets mixed up. As a result, businesses would count the amount of solar or wind they pay for against their overall electricity use to calculate their carbon footprint reduction. Despite uncertainties about the impact of a Trump administration on renewable energy – the president-elect has criticized regulations that pressure businesses to address climate change – businesses and market analysts said the prices for renewable energy have fallen steep enough to make them a more feasible option. “Certainly, there are many policy questions yet to be answered, but I don’t see the US election having a significant impact on our commitments,” Janous said. The article was amended on 27 December 2016. The charts on wind energy contracts signed by top corporate buyers showed data in gigawatts when they should be in megawatts."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/07/an-adder-stirs-a-brawny-cable-charged-by-the-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-07T04:30:00Z","webTitle":"An adder stirs, a brawny cable charged by the sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/07/an-adder-stirs-a-brawny-cable-charged-by-the-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/07/an-adder-stirs-a-brawny-cable-charged-by-the-sun","fields":{"headline":"An adder stirs, a brawny cable charged by the sun","bodyText":"Beneath the granite knuckles of this east Dartmoor tor the land spreads and softens high above the valley. Sheep-clipped grasses and scattered clumps of gorse cover the sides of the outcrop, punctuated by exposed boulders. After a lengthy spell of rain, morning sunshine makes a welcome change, and the temperature along this south-facing incline is climbing steadily. I follow a path worn in the thin turf a short distance up the slope before cutting across rough ground. At the base of an overgrown bank, a shape on a sheltered patch of grass a couple of paces ahead stops me in my tracks: a thick cylindrical form, bent double like a section of trombone pipe and lying motionless in the sun. Nothing brings you to a halt like an adder. Perfectly camouflaged, it would have been easy to miss; its clay-pale body with the charcoal-black zigzag running the length of its back blending with shadows cast by surrounding bracken. This is the first adder I have come across on Dartmoor – where the snakes are believed to be holding their own despite national declines blamed on the loss of undisturbed, open, habitat. The dark block-print markings indicate that this 2ft specimen is a male, recently emerged from hibernation ahead of browner and larger females; over the spring rival males will battle in a sinuous test of strength known as the “dance of the adders”. The snake has felt my approach and stirs from its slumber, a muscular cable charged with solar energy. Packing a venomous bite – though one that rarely proves deadly, with Britain’s last fatality recorded in 1975 – the adder also has an unblinking red gaze which betrays no sign of fear. Yet this long-persecuted species prefers to keep out of sight, and, in a moment, it slips away, disappearing into the undergrowth. Nearby I come across another, basking close to cover, and then a tangle of three males coiled like Cumberland sausages beside a rock. The sun, the season and this special place have served up a lifetime’s worth of adder encounters in the space of a few minutes. I return to the path, watching my step."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2016/jun/23/india-solar-panel-scheme-local-communities-teamwork-guiding-light","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-23T04:00:00Z","webTitle":"Indian solar scheme shows local teamwork can be a guiding light | Eric Kasper","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/23/india-solar-panel-scheme-local-communities-teamwork-guiding-light","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2016/jun/23/india-solar-panel-scheme-local-communities-teamwork-guiding-light","fields":{"headline":"A solar scheme in India shows local teamwork can be a guiding light","bodyText":"At last month’s world humanitarian summit in Istanbul, leaders outlined a set of core responsibilities for humanity, and spoke of the need to reform development assistance. One proposal was to place greater emphasis on local ownership and control of projects. The idea is simple: rather than providing ready-made solutions that might not be right for a particular country, development assistance should facilitate access to tools that enable people to come up with their own fixes. In India, community groups set up in villages and slums to tackle specific problems are known as self-help groups. These groups, typically predominantly female, are often established to access microfinance loans, but they can also lead members towards the possibilities offered by new technologies. In Raipur, a city in central India, groups are partnering with businesses and NGOs to produce useful, relevant products using open-source technologies, thereby offering members a chance to create sustainable livelihoods. These technologies – which include self-replicating 3D printers and “instructables” for making your own solar panels – are generally cheap to access. They are shared and co-developed by collectives, usually online. After exploring opportunities, needs and interests, participants in the Eco-Green Livelihoods project decided to produce solar power systems capable of lighting homes in rural villages that remain off-grid. Working together, local technicians and NGO staff used open-source designs shared online to produce the solar sets. Unlike solar-powered products manufactured in large facilities using designs that are the exclusive intellectual property of large corporations, this kind of project trains marginalised communities to build low-cost products that will answer basic needs in a region crippled by electricity shortages. All the materials required to make the sets – solar panels, batteries and the basic components of electronic circuits – are available in nearby markets. Because the design information is freely available, and the materials are easily accessible, a moderately skilled technician can train people from the slums to make a robust product capable of solving their development problems. Ram Kumar, a technician, trains a mainly female group to make the solar power systems. “These women, who have little education and previously could only get a few hours of work a week cleaning other people’s homes, have now learned to make this fairly technical product and are earning a much better living,” Kumar says. The £20 device manufactured and marketed by the group provides a small amount of uninterrupted, free, off-grid electricity. The money is not enough to run big screen TVs or air conditioners, but it is ample for two or three light bulbs, a charging point for a family’s mobile phone, and a few other essentials. Collectively, these things make a big difference to people’s lives. The cost is high for most people, but sometimes it is subsidised, or people can pay in instalments. This is exactly what is needed in the hundreds of rural villages across India where people have no access to the grid. Group members install the solar lighting systems in people’s homes, collect the payments in monthly instalments, and take responsibility for regular maintenance. Because of their personal involvement, villagers see their new access to electricity as a collective achievement, and participants enjoy a small collective savings account, funded by sales of their products. They can use this money to invest in other projects in the village. Sometimes, these local initiatives can even catalyse action from the state. A village in Mahasamund district, Chhattisgarh, was the first to achieve complete solar lighting through the Eco-Green project. After years of government inaction, the village was connected to the grid within a month of installing the solar power systems. But some villagers were unimpressed by this tardy official intervention. Shruti, the first lady to install a solar-powered light, told me how the project had changed her life. “This [solar] light is free, so why would we switch on the other one? They have installed the electric line because now they see we have power.” This process of building livelihoods and meeting development needs is one potential solution to the problem of off-grid or “mini-grid” electrification. And while it may not completely eradicate energy inequality, achieving access to power through collective action is a good first step. Using a small technological innovation – like open-source solar – individuals can take control, and their actions can strengthen the impact of development assistance and multiply the transformative potential of technologies.

Zac Goldsmith put down six questions between November 2011 and February 2012 after the government announced it would slash subsidies to the solar industry. Goldsmith warned MPs that there was panic in the industry over ministers’ plans. His younger brother, Ben, a venture capitalist, had personally invested in one solar energy firm Engensa, which described the cuts as unacceptable. Ben Goldsmith’s investment fund, WHEB, also owned a quarter of Engensa’s software partner, PassivSystems, a firm valued at £40m in 2014. Zac Goldsmith also has a personal stake in a separate £24m investment fund run by WHEB and by 2011 his younger brother had donated £15,000 to his parliamentary office, according to the Commons’ register of members’ interests. Despite these links, the Tory MP did not declare his brother’s interests when intervening in the Commons. Parliamentary rules at the time stated MPs should declare “any past, present or expected future financial interest, direct or indirect … when a member is making a speech in the House or in committee or participating in any other proceedings of the House”, that might “reasonably be thought by others to influence the speech, representation or communication in question”. It goes on to say that the declaration should be “brief but should make specific reference to the nature of the interest”. A spokesman for Goldsmith said he had declared his interests properly, adding that when the Tory MP had asked the questions in parliament, the code of conduct only required conflicts of interests that arose from spouses and partners to be identified. The 2009 parliamentary code of conduct, which applied at the time, said MPs are “required to declare relevant indirect interests, for instance those of a spouse or partner, and also non-registrable interests of a financial nature where these are affected by the proceedings in question”. Labour said it would be calling for an investigation into why the London mayoral candidate did not declare the Goldsmith family interest. Caroline Flint, the Labour MP who was shadow energy and climate change secretary under Ed Miliband, said: “It seems reasonable to conclude that Zac Goldsmith should have declared the conflict of interest between his family’s personal financial involvement with this company, including his brother’s central role, and the companies held within its small portfolio when asking government ministers questions and involving himself in the writing of reports.” She added that she would be writing to the parliamentary authorities shortly to demand a full investigation. Since last year, the parliamentary rules have been updated to explicitly list the types of relation – “parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece of the MP or of a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner of the MP” – whose relevant business interests would have to be mentioned by an MP in “any proceeding of the House”. On the campaign trail Zac Goldsmith, an environmentalist with a £300m personal fortune, has promised voters he will build a “solar revolution” in the capital if he becomes London mayor. Ben Goldsmith, a banker, keeps a lower profile but has led the charge to bring sun-powered panels to Britain’s roofs. By 2011, the then 31-year-old venture capitalist had financed and taken stakes in a series of companies that used British and European Union public subsidies to sell solar energy systems to homeowners. The network of companies that were connected to Ben Goldsmith relied on a steady stream of cash from “feed-in tariffs” that paid a fixed sum for 25 years per kWh of solar energy produced. In October 2011, coalition ministers announced that these solar subsidies would be slashed by half, a move one of Ben Goldsmith’s firms – Engensa – said would “result in massive job losses”. A year after the government’s environmental support was slashed, Ben Goldsmith’s Engensa was sold to a Chinese firm. Critics also accuse Goldsmith of political hypocrisy as he backs Britain’s exit from Europe despite his brother’s investments benefiting from EU funds that tech businesses would be denied in the event of a Brexit. Flint said: “Given what we have learned about Zac Goldsmith and his family’s investments, it appears unlikely he would not understand how the European Union helps British companies in high-growth sectors, such as green energy, get access to the investment they need from across Europe. So it is hypocritical of him to seek to deny the same opportunities to British companies if the UK left the European Union.” Both brothers are key movers in Tory green politics: Ben Goldsmith chairs the Conservative Environment Network, which promotes “decentralised, market-orientated solutions” to environmental issues. Zac Goldsmith is on the network’s steering committee. They draw their wealth from the billion-pound inheritance of their late father, Sir James Goldsmith, a corporate raider turned anti-EU politician. According to his financial return, posted as part of his bid to be London’s mayor, in the two years from 2010 Zac Goldsmith made more than £1m in capital gains. Ben Goldsmith has key roles in the family’s finances: he is a director of Cavamont Holdings, the Goldsmith’s investment holding vehicle, which was registered offshore in the Cayman Islands in 2005. He is central in overseeing the holding company’s investments – chairing its family committee. WHEB, in which Ben Goldsmith had a stake, last year received £5m in backing from the state-owned British Business Bank. It also controlled Zac Goldsmith’s personal investments in a £24m private equity fund along with stakes held by the Goldsmith family’s offshore vehicle Verton Holdings. The Tory MP recorded his investment in the private equity fund in the parliamentary register. He states he receives “no income and nor do I have any influence on the investments made”. In February, WHEB sold up and exited from its role in managing the funds, with its 25% stake purchased by German partners Alpina. Ben Goldsmith has continued his role in green investment. He has set up a new fund Menhaden – raising £80m from the stockmarket last year – and took stakes in the WHEB funds. He did not answer questions about his shareholdings and business interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-22T07:01:55Z","webTitle":"India plans nearly 60% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2027","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target","fields":{"headline":"India plans nearly 60% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2027","bodyText":"The Indian government has forecast that it will exceed the renewable energy targets set in Paris last year by nearly half and three years ahead of schedule. A draft 10-year energy blueprint published this week predicts that 57% of India’s total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027. The Paris climate accord target was 40% by 2030. The forecast reflects an increase in private sector investment in Indian renewable energy projects over the past year, according to analysts. The draft national electricity plan also indicated that no new coal-fired power stations were likely to be required to meet Indian energy needs until at least 2027, raising further doubts over the viability of Indian mining investments overseas, such as the energy company Adani’s Carmichael mine in Queensland, the largest coalmine planned to be built in Australia. India’s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, has been appealing to wealthier nations to provide capital to invest in renewable energy projects to help the country reach and exceed the targets agreed in Paris in November 2015. Significant state investment has not been forthcoming, but Tim Buckley, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said India had made up the shortfall with an influx of capital from the domestic and overseas private sectors in the past 12 months. Japan’s Softbank has committed to invest $20bn (£16.2bn) in the Indian solar energy sector, in conjunction with Taiwanese company Foxconn and Indian business group Bharti Enterprises. In September the largely French state-owned energy company EDF announced it would invest $2bn in Indian renewable energy projects, citing the country’s enormous projected demand and “fantastic” potential of its wind and solar radiation. Adani opened the world’s largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu earlier this year, and in October the energy conglomerate Tata announced that it would aim to generate as much as 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. Buckley said India’s “absolutely transformational” forecast was also driven by technological advancements that have led to the price of solar energy falling by 80% in the past five years. “India is moving beyond fossil fuels at a pace scarcely imagined only two years ago,” he said. “Goyal has put forward an energy plan that is commercially viable and commercially justified without subsidies, so you have big global corporations and utilities committing to it.” In the 2027 forecasts, India aims to generate 275 gigawatts of total renewable energy, in addition to 72GW of hydroenergy and 15GW of nuclear energy. Nearly 100GW would come from “other zero emission” sources, with advancements in energy efficiency expected to reduce the need for capacity increases by 40GW over 10 years. About 50GW of coal power projects being developed in India would be “largely stranded” under the forecast, Buckley said, with official modelling showing that “none of these plants are required before 2022 and only possible before 2027”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/mar/19/solar-power-industry-jobs-market-coal-west-virginia","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-19T14:00:09Z","webTitle":"Green energy in a coal state: the struggle to bring solar jobs to West Virginia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/19/solar-power-industry-jobs-market-coal-west-virginia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/19/solar-power-industry-jobs-market-coal-west-virginia","fields":{"headline":"Green energy in a coal state: the struggle to bring solar jobs to West Virginia","bodyText":"If solar energy were Dan Conant’s only passion, the West Virginia native could have stayed in Vermont, working for a fast-growing startup in a state friendly to renewables. Instead, Conant returned home to Shepherdstown, where he started an installation company, Solar Holler, in 2014. Now, with three employees and a crew under contract, Conant’s new passion comes with an audacious goal: bring solar jobs to communities hit hard by the decline of coal. “I really feel like we’re in a race against time, that it’s important we diversify quickly so young folks don’t have to move away,” says Conant. “It’s been really frustrating over the years to see all of my friends leave – pretty much everyone I went to high school with. The state is experiencing a serious brain drain.” Conant is part of a small group of entrepreneurs who believe in the possibility of replacing disappearing coal jobs with employment in solar in West Virginia. It’s a monumental challenge. The state lacks the mix of solar-friendly regulations, financial incentives and high electricity prices that have made solar affordable and created a booming market in states such as California and Massachusetts. Despite the odds, Conant and his allies are finding ways around some of the obstacles. They point to the falling cost of solar energy systems that will help to make renewable energy more attractive to West Virginians. Conant and other proponents of solar also believe that the market forces that have made coal a more expensive and less desirable commodity will eventually persuade the state’s politicians to abandon the idea of resurrecting the declining industry. The economic picture of West Virginia is bleak. The Mountain State has the nation’s seventh-highest poverty rate. The number of coal jobs dropped from nearly 25,000 in 2011 to fewer than 11,500 in the third quarter of 2016. And those numbers only represent mining itself. When mines shut down, it affects everything – local businesses that serve the industry’s employees and their families lose revenue and government services are hurt by a shrinking tax base. Automation and less labor-intensive extraction methods such as strip mining and mountaintop removal caused job losses for decades, but stricter environmental regulations and a boom in natural gas, which made it cheaper than coal, have contributed to steeper job cuts in recent years, says Brian Lego, a research assistant professor who studies the coalmining industry at West Virginia University. Coal production fell from 158m tons in 2008 to 80m tons in 2016, Lego says. The state’s political leaders recognize the need to promote industries beyond coal, but their plans don’t include the renewable energy sector. The newly elected governor, Jim Justice, says he wants to create more jobs in harvesting timber, building roads and other infrastructure, tourism and agriculture. Justice, a billionaire Democrat who owns a resort, a coal company and a large farm operation, also isn’t giving up on reviving the coal business. With just over 1.8 million residents, West Virginia ranks 38th in population but second only to Illinois in population loss. Federal census data shows that the state’s population fell by 10,000 people during the 12 months ending July 2016. Against the depressing backdrop, the growth of the solar industry nationwide offers hope to people like 31-year-old Conant. The industry employed more than 260,000 people in 2016, a 25% increase over the previous year, according to the annual job census by the Solar Foundation. The survey, which counts full and part-time workers, found 381 solar-related jobs in West Virginia in 2016, including installation, sales, project development and manufacturing. One of the state’s largest installers, Mountain View Solar, based in Berkeley Springs in the eastern panhandle, employs about 25 people and works on projects in neighboring Maryland, Pennsylvania and Washington DC. The capacity for generating solar electricity from systems at homes and businesses reached 5.1 megawatts in West Virginia in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s a tiny amount compared with the 2,583 megawatts installed in the US residential market in 2016 alone. One of Conant’s strategies to build a strong business is to contract workers from Coalfield Development Corp, a nonprofit training organization in the south-western county of Wayne that offers a 2.5-year, paid apprenticeship program and employs 50 staff members and apprentices. Coalfield trains its workers to do a variety of construction work, including installing solar panels and electrical equipment. The partnership is cost effective for Conant because his company doesn’t shoulder the cost of recruiting workers or employing them in between installations, when they are redeployed on other Coalfield construction projects. “It sounds really bold to say it, but what we’re trying to do is to rebuild the Appalachian economy from the ground up,” says Brandon Dennison, Coalfield’s co-founder and CEO, who grew up in Wayne County. “We’re not ashamed to say we need to diversify our economy because it’s not been good for anybody to be so dependent on one thing. We don’t get into the moral argument of coal being good or bad, we just talk about jobs and entrepreneurship.” Since joining forces in 2015, Solar Holler and Coalfield have done rooftop solar projects and LED lighting installations for churches, a public library, a building owned by Catholic Charities, some affordable housing units and local businesses. Solar Holler is working on 1 megawatt-worth of projects at various stages of development, or enough to power about 100 homes, Conant says. Coalfield offers out-of-worker miners, such as Jared Blalock, a chance to learn new skills, including solar installation. “I enjoy the work,” says Blalock, a 29-year-old father of two boys who worked in the mines for six years. “It’s a lot easier on the body, I’ll tell you that.” But at this point, he can’t count on solar work for long-term employment, he says, and a small nonprofit like Coalfield can’t compete with coal industry pay. Like the other apprentices, Blalock works 33 hours a week while earning a college degree, which he hopes will lead to a higher-paying job in construction management. The coal industry’s pay typically starts at $60,000 to $70,000, and he was making even more when he got laid off. “Last year I made $77,000, so I’ve taken a 50-60% pay cut,” Blalock says. Creating better-paying jobs will depend partly on whether companies are able to increase demand by helping their customers finance the purchase of solar systems. The state prohibits purchase agreements for power or solar leases, which are popular in solar-friendly states and allow people to pay little or no upfront cost to install solar panels. Instead, West Virginians have to pay in full with cash or a loan. A residential solar energy system generally costs between $15,000 and $20,000 on average nationwide, before a federal tax credit that offsets it by 30%. The tax credit doesn’t apply to nonprofit organizations, however. That has prompted Conant to experiment with different ways to help Solar Holler’s customers find funding. He came up with a solution for several projects, including a $55,000 rooftop system at Shepherdstown Presbyterian. Solar Holler helped arrange for a bank loan and lined up 100 members in the community who were willing to help pay off the loan by having an energy control device on their water heaters. The device, installed by Mosaic Power in Maryland, allows Mosaic Power to remotely turn the heaters on or off to help the electric grid operator manage supply and demand. For example, the grid operator pays to shut off heaters – in short intervals that won’t interrupt hot water use – when demand for electricity is high. Each household with the device can earn about $100 a year, which the folks in Shepherdstown donate to the church to pay off the loan. Building a solar market in a coal state will require patience. Coalfield is set to begin work on a new solar training center, located in Huntington, but the training there will include retrofitting lighting and installing cables because there aren’t yet enough solar projects for new recruits. The lack of supportive policies and low electricity rates are keeping many other solar companies away from West Virginia for now. “Because electricity is relatively cheap in West Virginia, it hurts the economics of installing a solar system, though that may not always be the case,” says Michael Kirby, the regional sales manager for Maryland and Washington DC for Direct Energy Solar. He points out that electricity prices tend to rise rather than fall, saying: “The cost to install solar has been cut in half over the last five or six years, which has made it viable in a lot of states where it wasn’t before.” Still, Direct Energy, which operates in a number of Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, has no plans to move into the Mountain State quite yet. Conant, meanwhile, is undeterred. “Renewables are going to be the main source of energy long term – it’s just a question of when,” he says. “I believe there’s a role for West Virginia to play, and we don’t necessarily need Californian companies or Massachusetts companies to come in and build up the industry for us. We can do it ourselves.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/feb/26/drones-robots-solar-power-plant-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-26T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"How drones are helping design the solar power plants of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/26/drones-robots-solar-power-plant-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/26/drones-robots-solar-power-plant-energy","fields":{"headline":"How drones are helping design the solar power plants of the future","bodyText":"At the edge of a plot of muddy farmland, a few miles down the road from the University of California at Davis, an engineer takes a few quick steps across crop rows and lets go of a three-foot drone. Within seconds, the device – which weighs less than 2lbs and carries a powerful camera – ascends hundreds of feet into the cold, clear, blue sky and begins to snap detailed photos of the ground far below, including a long row of large solar panels mounted on steel poles. This flight is just a test, demonstrated by Kingsley Chen, the drone fleet coordinator for SunPower at the solar company’s research and development center, which is under construction and about a two-hour drive northeast of the San Francisco Bay Area. The drone will enable SunPower to survey a wide region and help design a solar power farm that can fit more solar panels on a piece of land, more quickly and for lower costs than it previously could. The test highlights a growing use of the latest computing technologies – drones, robots, software, sensors and networks – by US companies to design, build and operate solar farms. After seeing the prices of solar panels drop dramatically over the past decade, companies are looking for new ways to cut costs and compete with fossil fuel power through project design. Cutting down the amount of land used by solar farms has additional benefits, particularly in places like California. It minimizes environmental impact, an issue that can be controversial for large projects built for utilities because they tend to spread across hundreds of acres of land in remote regions. Some of these projects have riled environmentalists, attracted lawsuits and forced solar companies, including SunPower, to commit money for land for wildlife conservation. “Solar companies and service providers are using many different types of technology to optimize both the deployment of solar and the operations and maintenance of solar,” says Justin Baca, the vice president of markets and research for the solar group Solar Energy Industries Association. He adds: “It’s all about cutting costs.” An increase in tech investment could help to boost growth as more large solar and wind farms come online in the US and worldwide over the next few decades. The US Energy Information Administration predicts that more solar power plants will be built and provide 1.4% of the country’s electricity by 2018, up from less than 1% in 2016. While solar makes up a tiny portion, it’s among the fastest-growing sources of new electricity generation capacity in the country. Solar Tetris “It’s like a big Tetris puzzle,” says Matt Campbell, vice president of power plant products at SunPower, as he and his team show off the company’s solar farm design software. On a screen is a detailed image of land that one of SunPower’s 10 survey drones has collected from the sky. Overlaid on the photos are Tetris-looking colored blocks that represent solar panels and inverters, which convert the direct current produced by the panels into electricity for the grid. A SunPower engineer can use the software to fit as many of the blocks as possible while laying out the configuration of a power plant. The company designed its algorithms to take into account hundreds of factors that a human engineer might overlook, such as where transmission lines will be or how much shade will be created by the panels as they follow the sun throughout the day. A decade ago, a survey of a project site would require dispatching a crew to gather information such as the steepness of a slope and the vegetation of the region, explains SunPower’s CEO and president Tom Werner. In contrast, using the software and drones enables engineers to design a project 90% faster, he adds. SunPower, a solar panel maker and solar farm developer in the US, is creating most of the technology it uses for project design. Meanwhile, a cottage industry is growing around creating technology for other solar power developers to design, build and operate solar farms. One of these is HST Solar, a four-and-a-half-year-old startup in Los Angeles that, like SunPower, has developed algorithms to swiftly plot out the best designs, layout and wiring for large solar farms. Using HST Solar’s artificial intelligence software, launched last year, companies can lower the costs of producing solar electricity by 30%, says Santanov Chaudhuri, co-founder of the company. So far, Chaudhuri says that customers have used the company’s software to design about 4 gigawatts of solar projects, which is about the amount of solar panel projects that are installed across the US in a single quarter. It isn’t just the sprawling solar farms that are benefiting from software and design tools. An Oakland, California, startup called PVComplete builds software for designing solar panel projects on rooftops. The software enables any engineer to design a system using a range of solar equipment, while also taking into consideration different local requirements, such as weather, for installing them. Claudia Eyzaquirre, who has worked in the renewable energy business for a decade, co-founded PVComplete in 2015 after noticing that all of the major solar companies were spending big money to build their own design software. But few options were available to smaller solar companies that didn’t have the money to do the same. Solar companies are also turning to the latest in computing technology to operate and maintain solar farms, not just design them. In 2013, SunPower bought a startup called Greenbotics, which developed a robot that lowers the cost of cleaning solar panels while using less water than human washers can do. The Greenbotics team now works on engineering projects at SunPower and manages SunPower’s fleet of 40 solar-panel cleaning robots. Solar developer Strata Solar uses drones with infrared cameras to survey the more than 1 gigawatt of solar projects after they’re operating. The images from the cameras can reveal any solar panels that aren’t producing electricity. “It’s a great way to check on the overall health of the systems,” says Gabe Cantor, Strata Solar’s director of design engineering. “You can spot problems down to the cell level.” Drones – who needs them? While drones are playing an increasing role in the solar industry, many companies aren’t convinced that they are cost effective, notes a report by The Electric Power Research Institute, which conducts research for the power industry. The technology being used by some in the solar industry isn’t as “sexy” as drones, says Jenny Chase, head of the solar research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A lot of it is “boring tech – like software”. First Solar, one of the largest power plant developers in the country, has experimented with drones for designing power plants and thermal imaging of operating solar farms. But it isn’t rolling them out for company-wide use right now. First Solar’s manager of business development, Jeremy Rand, says drones and robots aren’t sophisticated enough or affordable: “A lot of these technologies are in the experimentation phase and not quite there yet.” The falling prices for solar panels also make it difficult to justify an investment in emerging and more expensive technology, Rand adds. Both First Solar, and fellow manufacturer SunPower, saw their stock prices fall last year and now plan to cut thousands of jobs. “With the solar module price collapse, it’s a tough time to be truly inventive,” Rand says. But overall, the solar industry is investing in better technology because it has a long way to go to replace fossil fuels. The US solar energy industry is also facing an elimination of the tax subsidies that have historically been important for growth. At the same time, President Trump hasn’t made it clear on his policy for solar energy. “Technologies like (ours) can ultimately make solar independent without tax credits, and without subsidies, and much sooner than people think,” HST Solar’s Chaudhuri says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/12/trump-past-clean-energy-future-america-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-12T10:00:42Z","webTitle":"Trump is the past.

Clean energy is the future for America and the planet","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the historic Paris climate agreement and turn his back on the other 194 countries that signed it leaves him isolated on the world stage. But Trump is also isolated from the very Americans he purports to lead, and here lies hope. Across America, families, businesses, churches, institutions and governments are busy building a clean energy future. And no president can stop that. When he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Accord, Trump said: “I was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” And that prompted the mayor of Pittsburgh to join other American mayors – more than 100 so far – in affirming his city’s commitment to move to 100% renewable energy. This reflects the fact that the people of Pittsburgh – and Philadelphia and Phoenix and Salt Lake City and towns and rural areas across America – want clean energy in their backyards. In liberal areas and conservative ones, Americans are transforming the way they power their lives as we move to 100% clean energy for all. Consider Buffalo, in upstate New York. Once an industrial powerhouse dotted with manufacturing and steel mill factories, it lost half its population in the second half of the 20th century and became the third-poorest big city in the United States. It is home to exactly the kind of “forgotten” people Trump talked about on the campaign trail. In a city featuring old houses and tough winters, heating bills regularly cost more than rent for some. But in a once blighted area on the West Side, hundreds of residents are working with Push Buffalo – an organization Rahwa helps run – to weatherproof homes, install solar energy systems and build a stronger community, all while training local residents for good jobs in the emerging green economy. On the other side of the country, California’s Asian Pacific Environmental Network organized in eight different languages, from Korean to Cantonese, to secure $2bn for solar development in low-income housing projects. And in South Los Angeles, a community group called Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education – Scope – is helping black, Latino and low-income communities of color take advantage of economic and job opportunities in the growing clean-energy economy. But it’s not just city communities that are building a clean energy future that has the power to blunt the worst effects of climate change. So are rural American states, including states whose people voted for Trump. Iowa produced over 36% of its electricity from wind power last year – a bigger share than any other state. South Dakota gets almost 70% of its electricity from water and wind. In Kansas, wind energy has grown from less than 1% of the state’s electricity generation in 2005 to 24% in 2015. American businesses get it, too. Just ask Boeing, whose South Carolina airplane factory is powered by 100% renewable energy. Walmart, General Motors and other major US corporations are major customers for renewable power. In our work with the Solutions Project and Push Buffalo, we have seen how clean and efficient energy projects are everywhere, from universities to churches, from factories to farms and from military bases to shopping malls. Combatting climate change is an important motivation for many of these efforts. But we’ve seen that even Americans who don’t “believe” in climate change are embracing renewable energy. Some of them value cleaner air; others value energy independence and national security and others are called to care for creation. Simplifying it all is the economics: as renewables become as affordable as fossil fuels – and even more affordable – they become more common, and economies of scale make them cheaper still. And people in America are not only embracing these lower bills. They are embracing community ownership of renewable energy infrastructure, creating good local jobs and building local wealth. Their vision is to transform America’s energy economy from a draining and extractive model to a regenerative and sustainable model that makes communities – and the nation – stronger. Time and again, Donald Trump has promised to help forgotten, hard-hit Americans. But trying to hold back the rising tide of clean energy will not help them – and it won’t work, anyway. If Trump truly cared about making life better for the people he was elected to lead, he would join his fellow Americans – and the rest of the world – in building a prosperous, sustainable clean energy future. The people of this country will keep helping themselves – to renewable energy. They are putting this country and their communities first, in a way that also serves the planet. The US and the rest of the world will continue our historic march to clean energy for all – no matter who’s in the White House.

The White House launched a tool for people to report if their social media accounts had been “suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear ‘violations’ of user policies”. Julia Carrie Wong had some questions about it. New York mayor Bill de Blasio is set to announce his bid for the presidency tomorrow. He will be the 24th Democratic candidate in the race. President Trump appointed his 106th federal judge to the bench. Intrepid Guardian reporter Julia Carrie Wong took a look at the White House’s new tool to combat social media tech bias....and found out it’s just a web survey. She made her own survey in response: The Alabama abortion law will most likely be tied up in courts for quite some time - Planned Parenthood has already indicated that it would file a lawsuit. But just a reminder that President Trump has been quietly filling the federal court system with conservative-minded judges for years now. Alabama’s Republican-controlled state senate passed yesterday the most restrictive abortion law in the nation, making it a crime to perform the procedure at any stage of pregnancy. Today, despite protests and lawsuits, governor Kay Ivey signed the bill into law. More from the governor: In all meaningful respects, this bill closely resembles an abortion ban that has been a part of Alabama law for well over 100 years. As today’s bill itself recognizes, that longstanding abortion law has been rendered “unenforceable as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.” No matter one’s personal view on abortion, we can all recognize that, at least for the short term, this bill may similarly be unenforceable. As citizens of this great country, we must always respect the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court even when we disagree with their decisions. Many Americans, myself included, disagreed when Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973. The sponsors of this bill believe that it is time, once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter, and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur. If you want some more context for the whole national emergency telecoms threat, take a listen to this episode of Today in Focus in which Guardian reporters Rupert Neate, Alex Hern and Tania Branigan discuss Huawei, the company at the center of it all. Senator Kamala Harris tossed some sass into the Democratic race today when she was asked about running mates. Typically when this question comes up for the junior senator from California, it’s framed around whether she would be this or that candidate’s vice president. Instead, she turned the question on its head and pulled in former vice president Joe Biden, who has a strong lead in almost every national poll. “If people want to speculate about running mates, I encourage that, because I think that Joe Biden would be a great running mate,” she said. “As vice president, he’s proven that he knows how to do the job.” “Good Morning America” announced that New York mayor Bill de Blasio is scheduled to appear on the show tomorrow morning, sending tongues wagging that he will be announcing that he will be the 24th candidate in this race. Within minutes, a campaign spokeswoman confirmed the announcement to NBC News. President Trump has long been outspoken about social media companies banning far-right and other extremist figures. Today, it appears that the White House has launched a tool for people to report if their accounts had been “suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear ‘violations’ of user policies”. “SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS should advance FREEDOM OF SPEECH,” the landing page reads. “No matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against you, share your story with President Trump.” Visit the page here. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over the blog for Joanna Walters and Jessica Glenza. In case you missed it, here’s FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s statement on President Trump’s national emergency declaration over alleged telecoms threats from foreign companies. Here’s a quick recap of what’s been happening this Wednesday afternoon: Donald Trump has just declared a national emergency, barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms that could pose a national security risk. This paves a path for a ban on business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Commercial flights between the US and Venezuela have been suspended by acting US homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan because conditions in Venezuela threaten the “safety and security of passengers, aircraft and crew”. Many airlines have already stopped flying to the country because of security concerns. Abortion providers in Ohio have formally filed a lawsuit against the so-called “fetal heartbeat” bill that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Lawmakers in Ohio, like their counterparts in Alabama yesterday, enacted the law to tee up a legal challenge to Roe vs Wade. A California man who threatened to kill employees of the Boston Globe after the newspaper made calls last year for media organizations to denounce Trump has pleaded guilty in federal court this afternoon. At the same time, Trump went on a Tweet-vent against the New York Times and the Washington Post. Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies Co, Reuters writes. The news agency had reported yesterday that Trump was expected to take action on the long-awaited proposal this week. The executive order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States. The order directs the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up a plan for enforcement. Amid a deepening trade war with China, President Trump on Wednesday declared a “national emergency” to protect U.S. communications networks in a move that gives the federal government broad powers to bar American companies from doing business with certain foreign suppliers — including the Chinese firm Huawei, the Washington Post writes. More to follow.... Now back to the issue of the day: abortion rights. This hour we travel metaphorically to Utah, where a chief prosecutor in the county with the state’s only two clinics that provide abortion has said he won’t enforce strict, new legislation there. A recent law in Utah bans abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy, and is already the subject of a court challenge and cannot currently be enforced, the Salt Lake Tribune has reported. This week the Salt Lake County district attorney, Sim Gill, a Democrat, became the latest example of an official resisting ultra-conservative new restrictions around the US. Gill said the Utah ban appears unconstitutional, so any idea of taking up the legislation’s provision to file felony charges against doctors who perform abortions, as the court challenge plays out, could violate their rights. “I think that’s the only legal and ethical thing for me to do, which is not use the power of my office to violate the constitutional rights of my citizens when there is well-established precedent that says it is unconstitutional,” he said, the AP reports. The decision by Gill and echoes a similar one from the attorney general of Michigan. With anti-abortion advocates optimistic designing extreme legislation as a route to challenging Roe vs Wade, blue-leaning states are moving to secure access to abortions. Against that backdrop, pushback from prosecutors could become more common, especially in politically mixed areas, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. Prosecutors also have a lot of discretion about how laws are enforced because they decide who to charge and what cases to file. Before the 1973 decision legalizing abortion, many bans weren’t enforced unless there were complications, Ziegler said. “You’ll see more statements of this kind. But how they’ll be enforced is much more complicated than what first may seem to be the case,” she said. Most laws have exceptions. The measure in Utah has allowances for cases of rape, fatal fetal deformity and serious detriment to a woman’s health. Like Utah, Arkansas has also passed a ban on abortions after 18 weeks. Gill secured a federal order on Monday confirming his office won’t have to enforce the measure while the court challenge there plays out. However, if the law is eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court, Gill said, he likely would have to enforce it. “My job is to keep my personal beliefs out of it, but I absolutely believe that our citizens have constitutional rights and our institutions have an obligation to serve those citizens and not simply roll over and play dead,” he said. Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, also a Democrat, pledged at a state Planned Parenthood conference not to enforce the state’s pre-existing abortion ban if Roe is ever overturned. This afternoon the president, once again, decided to tweet-vent against the New York Times and the Washington Post, calling both organs fake news for reporting that there’s in-fighting among his foreign policy team. As this was happening, a California man who threatened to kill employees of the Boston Globe after the newspaper last year called on media organizations nationwide to denounce Donald Trump’s attacks on the media pleaded guilty in federal court, prosecutors said. Robert Chain, 68, of Los Angeles, pleaded guilty to seven counts of making threatening communications in interstate commerce, the US attorney’s office in Boston said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. He faces five years in prison per count at his sentencing, scheduled for September 23. Neither Chain nor his attorney spoke when they left court. But his attorney, William Weinreb, said last month his client took “full responsibility” for his actions. “He is anxious to make a full, public apology, expressing his sincere remorse to those he affected,” Weinreb said in an email last month. Shady! Bill Barr, Nancy Pelosi and handcuffs all in one sentence. Fox News producer Jake Gibson tweets that the attorney general got actual facetime with the House Speaker earlier and apparently he asked if she’d brought her handcuffs. Pelosi, earlier this month accused William Barr, of committing a “crime” when he told lawmakers during a congressional hearing in April that he was unaware that special counsel Robert Mueller was unhappy with his portrayal of the findings from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any collusion or obstruction of justice by the president of the Trump campaign. “The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States,” she said at the time. “And that’s a crime.” North Carolina’s most infamous political story lines of recent years are merging into a congressional race this summer that pits the architect of the state’s “bathroom bill” against a Democrat who was granted an electoral do-over after evidence of ballot fraud tainted his prior opponent’s campaign. State Sen. Dan Bishop topped nine other Republican candidates seeking the 9th Congressional District nomination on Tuesday, winning almost half of the ballots cast in an extremely low turnout election that drew less than 10% of the eligible voters. He will face Democrat Dan McCready, as well as Libertarian and Green candidates, on Sept. 10. Bishop’s role as sponsor of a headline-grabbing “bathroom bill” that voided anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people is likely to be a focal point in this repeat race, ordered by election officials who deemed last year’s contest too tainted to stand. And despite the low turnout on Tuesday, the general election could draw a heavy infusion of political cash on both sides because it’s virtually alone on the political calendar this year. The vote count last November showed McCready, a former Marine and Harvard MBA, narrowly losing to Republican Mark Harris. But then, an investigation found Harris ignored warnings and paid a political operative who collected mail-in ballots. Harris opted not to run again. In 2016, Bishop sponsored House Bill 2, the law that voided a Charlotte ordinance expanding LGBT rights and prevented similar anti-discrimination rules anywhere else in the state. HB2 was nicknamed the “bathroom bill” because it also directed transgender people to use public bathrooms and showers that matched their birth sex. The measure made waves nationally and prompted boycotts by entertainers, governments and some businesses thinking about moving jobs to North Carolina. Bishop said while voters knew HB2 had his whole-hearted backing, the law was partially repealed in 2017 and is no longer as important as other issues. “People are astonished and amazed and dismayed at what they see coming out of Washington these days from liberal crazy clowns. Socialism. Open borders. Infanticide. 90% tax rates. Having prison inmates vote. It goes on and on,” Bishop told supporters Tuesday night. “And of course, most of all, an incessant drive to impeach the president.” With conflict between President Donald Trump and Washington Democrats heating up after the investigation into Russian support for the president’s 2016 campaign, the four-month contest between Bishop and McCready is expected to serve as a measure of political tides and an open vault for donors. McCready ran a solar-energy financing fund before starting his run for Congress two years ago. He’s built up his name recognition over the extended campaign and had almost $1.6 million in cash on hand as of May 2, according to Federal Election Commission reports. But McCready will be swimming upstream in a congressional district that has been in GOP hands since 1963 and which Trump won by 12 percentage points in 2016. The district stretches from suburban Charlotte to suburban Fayetteville along the South Carolina border. Bishop accused McCready of refusing to clearly state his positions on public issues during last year’s primary and general elections. McCready “went through two elections without telling anyone where he stood on anything. That ends tomorrow,” Bishop said Tuesday night. McCready last year said he would not support Nancy Pelosi for her top leadership role in the U.S. House. She was elected speaker in January after Democrats took over the House majority. McCready refused during an October debate to rule in or out whether he supported impeaching Trump. But the GOP’s brand also has suffered in the wake of the much-publicized investigation into Harris’s campaign, followed last month by federal charges accusing the state party’s chairman of working with a big-money donor to try bribing North Carolina’s top insurance regulator. As states such as Georgia and Alabama move to near-total bans on abortion, often making the procedure illegal before women know they are pregnant, men are likely to also be severely impacted. Like many other states, Georgia has robust child support laws with financial consequences. Here is a run-down of what the impacts could be for men from Quartz: A ‘non-custodial parent,’ or the parent any child doesn’t live with (the man in about 80% of the cases in the US), is required to turn over a significant portion of his income in Georgia to the custodial parent until the child finishes high school, or is 20 years old, whichever comes first. That amount now depends on a calculation of both parents’ income and health care costs; 20% of gross pay was standard in Georgia in the past. The secretary of homeland security announced conditions in Venezuela threaten the “safety and security of passengers, aircraft and crew,” and suspended flights to the South American country. Reuters reported that Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and many airlines had already stopped flying to the country because of security concerns. American Airlines Group Inc indefinitely suspended flights to Venezuela in March. In April, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. air operators from flying below 26,000 feet in Venezuela’s airspace. Last week, the Trump administration expanded sanctions to pressure President Nicolas Maduro to cede power to Juan Guaido. The White House has criticized House Democrats’ investigation into obstruction of justice by the president as serving “political theater.” In turn, the lawmaker in charge of those investigations called the White House position “preposterous” in an interview. The letter was sent by White House council Pat Cipollone, in response to a March request by Congressional investigators for documents. In a 12-page letter, Cipollone asked the committee to narrow its “sweeping” request and provide a legislative reason why the documents should be released, according to Reuters. The White House will not participate in the committee’s ‘investigation’ that brushes aside the conclusions of the Department of Justice after a two-year-long effort in favor of political theater pre-ordained to reach a preconceived and false result,” Cipollone’s 12-page letter said. Here is more reporting from Reuters: The documents requested relate to everything from the contents of Trump’s meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin to his communications with former White House counsel Donald McGahn, the firing of former White House national security advisor Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, and possible pardons for Trump associates who pleaded guilty to crimes stemming from the probe. The committee also seeks documents aimed at probing whether Trump has used the White House to enrich himself in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause. In his 448-page redacted report released last month, Mueller described numerous links between Trump*s 2016 presidential campaign and various Russians but concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish that the campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow. Jameela Jamil, formerly a presenter on BBC Radio 1 and now one of the stars of the sitcom The Good Place, opened up about an abortion she had when she was young. Jamila called it the “best decision I have ever made.” The Trump administration announced today it would delay tariffs on cars from Europe, a decision which was to be decided by May 18. Now, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would travel to Beijing to continue trade talks with China. “My expectation is that we will go to Beijing at some point in the near future to continue those discussions,” said Mnuchin in a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, according to Reuters. “We’re continuing discussions. There’s still a lot of work to do.” More on the decision here, from the Guardian business liveblog. Yesterday, a top British general contradicted US intelligence reports about increased, but vague, threats from Iran. A story in the New York Times argues talk of increased threats from Iran are meant to draw Iran into an “armed conflict” with the US. While Alabama’s Republican Governor considers whether to sign the state’s near-total abortion ban, abortion providers in Ohio have formally filed a lawsuit against an abortion ban there. Lawmakers in Ohio enacted a law which bans abortion after six weeks, called a “fetal heartbeat” bill. At six weeks, a pregnancy is called an embryo, and the still microscopic tissues which will become the heart have not fully formed. When lawmakers enacted the law, they acknowledged it was unlikely to ever go into effect, but was instead meant to challenge Roe versus Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in the US. “If a woman is forced to continue a pregnancy against her will, it can pose a risk to her physical, mental, and emotional health, as well as to the stability and well-being of her family, including existing children,” the lawsuit said, according to the AP. With both chambers of the Alabama legislature passing a near-total abortion ban, attention is going to turn to Republican Governor Kay Ivey, who must sign the bill for it to become law. The law has no exemptions for rape or incest, and criminalizes doctors who perform the procedure. Anti-abortion campaigners hope the law will be challenged in court, and eventually prompt the US Supreme Court to reconsider Roe versus Wade. Abortion remains legal in all 50 states as long as Roe versus Wade stands. Here is more reporting from the AP: Abortion rights advocates Wednesday morning urged Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey to reject the bill and vowed swift legal action if it is enacted. “We are laser-focused on urging Gov. Kay Ivey to veto this dangerous bill. If she chooses not to, then we will take this to court and ensure that abortion remains safe and legal and accessible in the state of Alabama,” said Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast. Ivey has not commented on the bill but the Republican fixture in Alabama has long identified as anti-abortion and the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Terri Collins, said she expects her to sign the legislation. ...“Roe v. Wade has ended the lives of millions of children,” Alabama Republican Sen. Clyde Chambliss said in a statement. “While we cannot undo the damage that decades of legal precedence under Roe have caused, this bill has the opportunity to save the lives of millions of unborn children.” Democrats criticized the bill as a mixture of political grandstanding and a waste of taxpayer dollars. “The state of Alabama ought to be ashamed of herself. You ought to be ashamed. Go look in the mirror,” Sen. Bobby Singleton said “Women in this state didn’t deserve this. This is all about political grandstanding.” Trump returned to one of his favorite topics during this speech: the southern border. With an assist from Guardian US reporter Amanda Holpuch, we are fact-checking his statements. Trump: The “wrong people [are] being allowed to come in” over the Southern border, and that sanctuary cities are “deadly”. More context... While 310,531 people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border illegally in 2017, in the same year more than 600,000 people who entered the US legally by air or sea overstayed their visas and remained in the country at the end of the year, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This is a tiny fraction of the 52 million people who entered the US legally in 2017. It is estimated that the number of visa overstays are actually higher, because the DHS report does not include land crossings. Trump: “I don’t think most countries are giving us their finest,” he added. Actually... The share of families are coming over the border has increased steadily since 2012, many of whom are refugees from violent countries. Here is one advocate Jorge Santos from Udefegua, which monitors attacks against journalists: “There’s a growing feeling that there is little possibility of a dignified life in Guatemala which is producing the increased flow of migrants and refugees.” President Trump just brought the family of California police officer Corporal Ronil Singh up to the microphone to speak, through Secret Service barricades. “Every family sitting out here wants justice,” said his widow, holding his 10-month-old son, “And that’s what I want for my husband.” Trump has said the perpetrators of ambushes on police should, “get the death penalty”, to cheers. “The ongoing attacks on our police must end,” Trump said. The trials of perpetrators should “go fast,” and added “fair but fast.” Trump is now speaking about police officers killed in the line of duty. Two of those officers are Brookhaven, Mississippi police officers who were shot in January, Corporal Zach Moak and Patrolman James White. “This morning we are honored to be joined by the families of both of these remarkable officers,” he said. The White House will not sign onto the “Christchurch call to action”, an international agreement to combat online extremism and hate speech. This is the statement from the White House, from the Washington Post: We continue to be proactive in our efforts to counter terrorist content online while also continuing to respect freedom of expression and freedom of the press,” the White House said. “Further, we maintain that the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech, and thus we emphasize the importance of promoting credible, alternative narratives as the primary means by which we can defeat terrorist messaging.” Trump has often been criticized for retweeting conspiracy theories and alt-right personalities who boost white supremacy. Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden just tweeted about the near-total abortion ban passed by Alabama’s Senate Tuesday night. His comment is notable for two reasons. 1. Many Democratic candidates tweeted about this last night. It took him many hours longer to denounce the near-total ban. (This reporter is working on a full list of 2020 contender reactions right now.) 2. Biden has an inconsistent record on abortion. He is a Catholic, and at times, has voted in favor of restrictions, other times against them. Trump and members of his cabinet are now listening to the National Anthem. Trump is flanked by Attorney General Bill Barr and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, among others. President Trump has just entered the National Peace Officer’s Memorial Service. Again, here is the livestream. Democratic US presidential candidate and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand heads to Georgia tomorrow to rally against near-total abortion bans. Roughly one week ago, Georgia joined five other states in enacting a ban on abortion after six-weeks. The laws effectively ban all abortion, since most women do not yet know they are pregnant at six weeks. Georgia’s law makes exceptions for rape and incest, but other similar laws do not – for example in Ohio. From our story on the legislators who passed Alabama’s abortion ban: Alabama’s new law mandating an almost blanket ban on abortion, the strictest in the United States, was passed by this group of exclusively white, male politicians. The Alabama law will disproportionately affect black and poor women, because they are more likely to seek abortions, and less likely to have resources to obtain an abortion out-of-state. Of the 27 Republicans, all white men, that dominate the 35-seat Alabama senate, 25 voted to pass the bill late on Tuesday. This is what the Republican leadership group in the senate looks like, as presented on their caucus’s website: President Trump is expected to speak any moment at the 39th Annual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service – we will be watching live. Here is a link to the livestream if you want to watch it with us. Wisconsin’s legislature could be the next state to pass abortion restrictions as soon as today. The state legislature is now poised to pass the so-called “born alive” bill touted by President Trump, although the governor of that state promised to veto the bill. More reporting from the AP here: The moves in Wisconsin come as anti-abortion politicians and activists feel emboldened by the addition of conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. They hope to ignite legal fights and eventually overturn the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion. Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday night approved a bill that would ban nearly all abortions. And Missouri’s Republican-led Senate was taking up a bill Wednesday that would ban abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy, which is similar to so-called fetal heartbeat laws enacted by Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia. Wisconsin already bans abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, except in cases in which the mother’s life is in danger. This is well before the generally accepted age of viability, which the Supreme Court said in Roe v. Wade is between 24 weeks and 28 weeks. Wisconsin also has a law passed in 1849 that bans abortions and would take effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The bill before the Wisconsin Assembly on Wednesday addresses the extremely rare occurrence in which a baby is born alive during a failed abortion attempt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded just 143 instances nationwide in which live births resulted from at least 9.3 million abortion attempts between 2003 and 2014. There is no comparable data in Wisconsin because state officials don’t track it. ... The Assembly was also voting on three other abortion-related bills. The others would cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, prohibit abortions based on the fetus’ race, sex or defects and require providers to tell women seeking abortions using the drug mifepristone that the process may be reversed after the first dose. Amnesty International UK has just released a statement about Alabama’s abortion ban bill calling it “horrifying,” and “no better” than the current law in Northern Ireland. Here is Amnesty International UK’s Northern Ireland campaign manager Grainne Teggart: It’s devastating news that Alabama has become the latest in a string of US states to enact a horrifying abortion ban. The roll-back on reproductive rights in the US is happening at a terrifyingly rapid rate. We should be outraged by this, but let’s also remember that in the UK we’re no better – women in Northern Ireland are subjected to one of the most severe abortion bans in the world which also carries criminal penalties of up to life imprisonment. It’s shameful that that our government is allowing such a violation of reproductive rights to continue to blight the lives of so many. The UK government’s silence on the situation in Northern Ireland is putting the UK in the same camp as those US states pushing women’s reproductive health back into the dark ages. We should be leading on this issue, not lagging behind. We call on the Government to stop ignoring the cruel reality of our law and urgently legislate for change so that the harm caused is brought to an end.” Former US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton just tweeted her opposition to the Alabama bill. It is common to see abortion restrictions in the US – for the last two decades abortion opponents have been very effective at gradually restricting where, when and how a woman can obtain one. But at least one state has sought to protect abortion – New York. Here is more from the Guardian’s view on abortion: protecting a human right. At this grim time there are signs of hope. New York state has sought to bolster abortion rights this year. Chile somewhat eased its ban in 2017. And last year’s landslide vote in favour of repealing Ireland’s near-total ban resonated worldwide. Nine more US states are considering anti-abortion legislation similar to that just passed in Alabama. Bills have so far passed one chamber in Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to Guardian reporter Jason Wilson. Others have been introduced to statehouses in Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Texas and West Virginia without yet facing votes. Democratic US presidential candidates have condemned Alabama’s abortion ban. Here is what they said about the bill: As well, here are statements from US Democratic presidential candidates Cory Booker, Jay Inslee and Julián Castro. A federal court in Mississippi is scheduled to hear the first arguments against a six-week abortion ban in that state, brought by the state’s last remaining abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The judge hearing the case struck down a 15-week abortion ban in November 2018, saying it “unequivocally” violated a woman’s right to reproductive autonomy. Abortion remains legal in all 50 US states while civil rights groups challenge abortion bans. Why has Alabama passed such a strict abortion ban? Anti-abortion campaigners hope the bill will challenge the 1973 US Supreme Court case which legalized abortion, Roe versus Wade. Guardian US reporter Erin Durkin brought us these comments from one of the architects of the ban in Montgomery, Alabama, state Representative Rich Wingo: It goes after Roe directly... We’re going in the front door and we’re saying to the supreme court, please explain to us how this isn’t a person. With modern technology, with everything that we know, this child needs to be protected under the US constitution.” Although anti-abortion campaigners often reference changes in medical technology for their abortion restrictions, the real change has been in the US Supreme Court, where the Trump administration successfully confirmed two conservative justices. The bill still needs to be signed by Alabama’s Republican governor. Because Roe versus Wade remains in effect, abortion is still legal in all 50 states even as states enact bans. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s politics liveblog. Last night, Alabama passed the nation’s strictest abortion ban, outlawing the procedure for women and making it a criminal offense for physicians, except in cases where the woman faces fatal complications. The bill still must be signed by the state’s Republican governor before it becomes law. Civil rights groups have already promised a lawsuit. The bill is part of a wave of new legislation from Republican-led states. Anti-abortion campaigners hope they will reach the US supreme court and challenge Roe versus Wade, the 1973 decision which legalized abortion. Here’s what else is happening today: President Trump is expected to speak at the Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service at 11am ET. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son, agreed to testify in a closed-door interview with the Senate Intelligence committee. One of the first female Native American lawmakers in Congress is defying Trump’s push to drill for oil on public lands."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/16/the-war-on-coal-is-over-coal-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"The war on coal is over.

Coal lost.","bodyText":"Last week, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced, “the war on coal is over.” If there ever was a war on coal, the coal industry has lost. According to a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, many old American coal power plants are being retired or converted to natural gas, and new coal power plants aren’t being built because they’ve become more expensive than natural gas, wind, and solar energy: The share of US electricity coming from coal fell from 51 percent in 2008 to 31 percent in 2016—an unprecedented change. New UCS analysis finds that, of the coal units that remain, roughly one in four plans to retire or convert to natural gas; another 17 percent are uneconomic and could face retirement soon. Natural gas has now surpassed coal to supply 32% of US electricity (up from 21% in 2008), and solar and wind are up to 10% (from 3% in 2008). This trend will continue. As old coal plants continue to retire and be replaced by cheaper renewables and natural gas, their share of the US electricity supply will continue to plummet, and coal will become a fossil fuel in every sense of the word. That’s why American companies continue to invest in cheap, clean renewable energy. As a result, our air and water are becoming cleaner, Americans are becoming healthier, and our carbon pollution is falling. The shift away from coal poses a challenge for regions in which the local economy depends on the fossil fuel, but the transition is inevitable. A wise economic policy would involve funding programs to help those regions adapt to the change (Hillary Clinton proposed one such plan during her presidential campaign). A recent study showed that Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax with some of the revenue going to assist displaced coal workers. The Trump administration has instead opted to try and slow coal’s inevitable decline. Trump is desperate to burn more coal The Trump administration seems hell-bent on causing as much global warming as possible. First there was the historically irresponsible decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, joining war-torn Syria as the only world countries to reject the treaty. Then just a few weeks ago, Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced a plan to effectively take coal out of the free market and instead subsidize it with taxpayer dollars to bail out the industry and keep uneconomical coal power plants open. The hypocrisy ran thick – as Perry called for propping up the coal industry with increased taxpayer subsidies, Pruitt called for an end to subsidies for renewable energy: I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar. I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources, and let utilities make real-time market decisions on those types of things as opposed to being propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits that occur Soon thereafter, Priutt announced that Trump’s EPA will repeal the Clean Power Plan. That policy represented America’s most significant effort to cut its carbon pollution, but had been mired in a legal battle over whether the plan exceeded EPA’s regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act. Rather than let the courts decide the case, which many experts felt the EPA would win, Pruitt stopped defending the case in court and ended the program. The problem is that according to the US Supreme Court, the EPA is legally required to regulate dangerous carbon pollution. Pruitt’s EPA may propose a dramatically weakened plan that probably wouldn’t survive a court challenge, or he may just try to run out the clock on Trump’s term. As with the disastrous Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they don’t have a replacement plan. In the meantime, states and environmental groups will take his Clean Power Plan repeal to court. Pruitt’s Clean Power Plan repeal justification is largely based on bogus economics, which the Trump administration is using to reduce government estimates of the ‘social cost of carbon.’ This figure – which estimates how much a ton of carbon pollution costs society in terms of damages caused by climate change – is integral to many government policies. A majority of economists think the government’s estimate is too low, but Pruitt’s EPA manipulated the math by ignoring the costs of America’s carbon pollution to the rest of the world, and by using a high discount rate, which essentially says we care more about saving money now than preventing climate damages and suffering for future generations. However, because renewables and natural gas are now cheaper than coal, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that the US will meet the Clean Power Plan target of cutting carbon pollution from electricity generation 32% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite its repeal. That being said, with the Clean Power Plan in place, the US likely would have beat its targets. As this excellent tool created by Carbon Brief shows, many states like California and Idaho are ahead of the curve, but other states like Texas and West Virginia would have been forced to accelerate their transitions to clean energy, had the Clean Power Plan been enforced. The ball is in Congress’ court The good news is that none of the Trump administration’s moves are permanent. The next president can rejoin the Paris climate agreement, have the EPA draft new rules to regulate power plant carbon pollution, and revise the social cost of carbon based on real science and math. As Citizens’ Climate Lobby Executive Director Mark Reynolds wrote: Those who cheer the EPA’s move should remember that President Obama initiated the Clean Power Plan in 2015 in the face of Congress’s inaction on climate change. Without effective legislation to combat climate change, a future president could just as easily go down the path of executive action and regulations again. The best answer here is for Congress to pass legislation putting the market to work on solving climate change. There’s been some movement in this direction. A group of Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council called for a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which would grow the economy. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently called for a price on carbon pollution and is said to be working with Senator Whitehouse (D-RI) on climate legislation. The House Climate Solutions Caucus is now up to 30 Republican and 30 Democratic members and is trying to craft a bipartisan replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The Trump administration is taking every possible step to burn away our future, but fortunately the transition to a clean energy economy is unstoppable, and many of his party members are coming to grips with that reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/02/leslie-jesch-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-02T13:46:32Z","webTitle":"Leslie Jesch obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/leslie-jesch-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/02/leslie-jesch-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Leslie Jesch obituary","bodyText":"My father, Leslie Jesch, who has died aged 90, was a leading authority on the application of solar energy and a pioneer in the development of renewables internationally, and especially across Europe. He was born László Jesch in Budapest, the son of László Jesch, an electrical engineer and college principal, and his wife Ilona (nee Láng), who before she married had supported her large family by making the popular Hungarian food tarhonya, a sort of egg-based pasta. From the Benedictine monks who educated him he developed a deep appreciation of European history and culture, and he learned several languages. He graduated in engineering from university in Budapest and married Katalin Fekete, a research chemist, in 1953. After the Hungarian uprising of 1956, we crossed the border on a winter’s night to Austria where, as refugees, we were welcomed and looked after. We eventually settled in Pennsylvania, where Leslie used his expertise in thermodynamics and heat transfer in various jobs in industry. After an MSc from the University of Pennsylvania (1962), Leslie did a PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of Leeds (1970), supervised by Prof Derek Bradley, whom he had first met at a youth congress in Hungary. The PhD brought about a change of both career and country when he took up a lectureship in mechanical engineering at the University of Birmingham. My mother and I moved with him and eventually we all became British citizens. At Birmingham, Leslie developed his expertise in solar energy (he also dabbled in wind energy, a result of his passion for kite-flying) and set up a solar energy laboratory, which thrived and attracted PhD students from all over the world. Realising its potential, Leslie became active in the International Solar Energy Society, becoming its vice-president and receiving a special service award from the UK branch in 1999. He stimulated many European collaborations through ISES-Europe, of which he became president. He set up the Franklin Company, which provided consultancy in solar energy systems, and edited and published several solar journals, notably Sun at Work in Europe, giving work and a launch pad to many of his students. Leslie also wrote a monograph (Solar Energy Today, 1981) and a range of technical papers. In Birmingham, my parents lived in Rowheath Solar Village in Bournville, which he had helped to design. In retirement, they pursued their lifelong interests in theatre, concerts and travelling, and their garden parties were legendary. Leslie is survived by my mother Katherine, who like him anglicised her name when in the US, and myself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T14:05:39Z","webTitle":"Renewables cut Europe's carbon emissions by 10% in 2015, says EEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea","fields":{"headline":"Renewables cut Europe's carbon emissions by 10% in 2015, says EEA","bodyText":"A surge in the use of wind and solar energy helped Europe to cut its fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by about 10% in 2015, an authoritative new report has found. Energy use from renewables rose to 16.7% of Europe’s total, up from 15% in 2013, and accounted for 77% of the continent’s new power capacity. But the clean energy burst is still not moving fast enough to prevent a “lock-in” of already-commissioned fossil fuel capacity, which will otherwise transform into stranded assets. It was also unevenly spread across Europe, with renewables expanding to take up 30% of the power load in many Scandinavian countries, but only 5% in Malta. The UK had Europe’s seventh best record for the intensity of its greenhouse gasemissions, but was a mid-table performer in terms of emissions per capita, according to figures compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Mihai Tomescu, who authored the EEA study, said Europe’s renewable roll-out was accelerating, but not fast enough to halt global warming at 2C. “The current level of effort needs to be stepped up and this is not necessarily going to happen without additional focus,” he told the Guardian. The EEA’s report suggests that the EU is broadly on track to achieve its goals of 20% emissions cuts and 20% renewable energy share by 2020. But a more challenging target for 2050 – of reducing emissions by at least 80% – will require acceleration after 2030, when tough decisions about phasing out internal combustion engines and oil supplies will have to be taken. James Watson, the chief executive of SolarPower Europe, which represents Europe’s solar photovoltaic industry, said that today’s figures were in line with a 50GW spike in global solar capacity last year. “This is a good start and we must be positive about that but if we are truly to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement, we will need to see a much faster growth of renewables and a commensurate, much faster reduction of fossil fuels, and coal power in particular,” he said. Renewables have replaced 100m tonnes of oil equivalent electricity generation this decade, but will only need to replace 20m tonnes in the 10 years ahead, according to SolarPower Europe’s analysis. Tomescu noted that Europe’s growth in renewable energy was already coinciding with a drop in fossil fuel consumption. “In broad terms, we are talking about a substitution and this has an impact not only on import dependency but also avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/20/renewables-roadshow-how-the-people-of-newtown-got-behind-solar-powered-beer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-19T21:13:40Z","webTitle":"Renewables roadshow: how the people of Newtown got behind solar-powered beer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/20/renewables-roadshow-how-the-people-of-newtown-got-behind-solar-powered-beer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/20/renewables-roadshow-how-the-people-of-newtown-got-behind-solar-powered-beer","fields":{"headline":"Renewables roadshow: how the people of Newtown got behind solar-powered beer","bodyText":"Newtown – Sydney’s grungy inner-city suburb where a seemingly endless string of Thai restaurants is interrupted by body-piercing shops, clothes stores and a growing number of small bars. It’s a suburb known for its beer-fuelled nightlife and alternative cultural tastes. It’s also one of the most progressive areas in Australia: at the last New South Wales election, the Greens got more than 45% of the primary vote (and almost 60% after preferences) in the seat of Newtown. It makes sense, then, that beer and progressive environmental politics would come together in this suburb and, right in the middle of Newtown, a community-owned solar array is powering a local brewery. “Solar-powered beer tastes better,” says Oscar McMahon with a laugh. He is the cofounder of Young Henrys, a small local beer company whose brewery is now home to the solar array, which is owned by members of the Newtown community. NSW has become one of the worst states for driving the transition to renewable energy, so Newtown locals have taken matters into their own hands. The groups involved in the project – the brewery owners, the local investors, supporters in the NSW state parliament and the community energy provider Pingala – each have their own overlapping reasons to buy-in. McMahon is the epitome of the Newtown variety of hipster. Standing among the fermenters, he has an impressive amount of tattoos protruding from his black sleeveless shirt and a full long beard that would make any biker jealous. He and Richard Adamson began their business in a small warehouse space in Newtown in 2012. “We had a brewery that could produce 1200 litres at the time and we were generally selling about 5-10 kegs a week at the beginning,” McMahon says. “Five years later, we’ve got a much more efficient, bigger brewery. We now have five warehouses. We have sales people all over the country and we are selling nationally to about 300 different venues.” The idea for the business came out of a beer appreciation club they both attended. McMahon says the pair wanted to “create a brewery that is as in contact with the people that drink the beer as beer club is”. They have maintained that ethos by having a small restaurant or bar at each of their brewing locations and hand-picking the venues that sell their beer. They see the community solar project on their roof as another way to be in close contact with the community around them. “We are buying our power from people that have invested in an idea and infrastructure within our business,” he says. “The benefits are that you open yourself up to other people that believe in your company to actually buy in.” Adamson, McMahon’s business partner, thinks much of the local enthusiasm springs from the living situations of those who live there. “A lot of people who live in Newtown either rent or they live in apartments. They don’t really have the opportunity to access solar energy,” Adamson says. “This way they get to participate and know that at least some of the electricity being used in the area is being generated by solar.” Local state member Jenny Leong has been a supporter of the Pingala Young Henrys project from the start. So much so that hers was one of the 54 names drawn out of a hat with 300 names in it, allowing her to invest money personally in the project. “What we see here is the community stepping in and filling the gap that is completely left open by the fact that we have no leadership from our national or state governments when it comes to really addressing the issue of pollution and really moving us away from polluting fossil fuel industries,” she says. Indeed federal energy policy has been left in tatters after a decade of inaction on climate change. Investment in new electricity generation has stalled while many of the country’s old coal-powered generators are poised to close. Consequently official government projections show greenhouse gas emissions are rising and will continue to do so to 2030. This means there is no hope of achieving the cuts in emissions Australia promised to make when they signed up to the Paris agreement in 2015. Meanwhile, the lack of certainty for energy businesses has meant investment in energy generation has frozen, directly causing prices to jump and adding more than the cost of a $50 per tonne carbon price to wholesale energy prices. The ACT, Victoria and South Australia have moved ahead in this area but NSW has been slow to build their own renewable energy policy. In 2016 they announced a goal of having zero net emissions by 2050, which would require a lot of renewable energy generation, yet how that would be achieved has not been clearly spelled out. Leong says a project like this shows the community taking action, and moving forward without the politicians. “Newtown is an electorate that is made up of some of the most wonderfully progressive people in the country, who want to see a real shift towards genuine protection of our planet and our environment from pollution.” Pingala installed the brewery’s solar array and organised the ownership structure. The 29.9kW array is owned by 54 locals (including Leong), who will get 5%-8% return on their investment each year. The brewery sources a big chunk of its electricity from a totally renewable source, while paying about the same for its electricity. At the end of 10 years, the locals will have made a profit on their investment and the solar array will be gifted to the brewery, who will continue to use it to generate free energy for another decade or longer. The Young Henry’s installation is the first project that Pingala has organised but they expect it to be the first of many. “We spent a long time developing our business models and building a community base,” says April Crawford-Smith, a convenor of the four-year-old community energy organisation. Their next step is to replicate the installation at other locations around Sydney. “We have amazing plans for the future, doing a similar project again on other breweries as well as looking at apartments and schools. And we have also looked at remote Aboriginal communities and energy affordability and solar as well,” Crawford-Smith says. “So we have a pretty broad remit. “It’s very ambitious but at the very heart of it is community and them driving forward solutions for our environment and our society.” For some at Pingala, the project of building community renewable energy is also about social justice. Pingala coordinator Tom Nockolds wants the public to own the sources of their own energy, taking it away from big business, and putting the profits and other benefits into the hands of the public. “Community ownership of renewable energy is so important because we are in the midst of an amazing energy transition. It’s no longer a question of if it’s going to happen, it’s happening all around us,” Nockolds says. “The real question is are we going to take advantage of the opportunity to build fairer systems in the way our energy systems are structured?” Leong believes her electorate of Newtown is the ideal place for the transition to begin. “The wonderful local feeling that is appreciated by so many in Newtown is to have a locally brewed beer powered by solar energy and linked to an incredible community initiative and a cooperative structure,” she says. “What could be better than solar powered beer?.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/jul/24/-solar-energy-tea-party-beliefs-not-despite-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-24T11:30:04Z","webTitle":"I support solar energy because of my Tea Party beliefs — not despite them | Debbie Dooley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/-solar-energy-tea-party-beliefs-not-despite-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/-solar-energy-tea-party-beliefs-not-despite-them","fields":{"headline":"I support solar energy because of my Tea Party beliefs — not despite them","bodyText":"I am a lifelong conservative and, also, a strong advocate for solar energy. As I travel the country advocating for solar using a free-market message, I am seeing an awakening among conservatives in this area. There are many areas that conservatives and progressives strongly disagree on, but both are united in a desire to pass on a legacy of true energy independence to future generations of Americans. The right to solar energy is an American issue – not a partisan one. America was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom, but unfortunately in many states there are regulatory barriers erected by the government that prohibits the freedom of choice for utility customers – especially when it comes to switching to solar. Most electric power companies have been granted monopoly status by virtue of legislation that grants these companies the exclusive right to sell electric power in their territory. They have a perfect setup in their business model. They have a government-assigned customer base whom they are able to bill for capital investments, thereby making a guaranteed profit. The more new power plants cost, the more money they make. The average consumer can now, in theory, install solar panels on their rooftops. Solar prices have plummeted in recent years and solar is now cost effective. But there are too many penalties in place that punish consumers who want to switch to solar. For example, in Florida a property tax is added that makes solar uncompetitive to the monopolies. Net Metering allows solar users to sell excess power generated back to the grid and recover the costs of their solar panels much faster. But in states like Wisconsin, the monopolies pay wholesale rate and not retail rate. This is very unfair to solar users because they are prohibited from selling excess power to anyone other than the monopolies. This amounts to prohibiting competition from rooftop solar and denying consumers the freedom to choose. We should all experience the freedom that comes from generating our own power and should have the right to sell the excess power generated on our private property. That would unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, drive innovation and also create jobs in a stagnate economy. But monopolies want to prevent that from happening. Industry trade group Edison Electric Institute deceptively claimed in a report that if solar users buy less power then non-solar users will see an increase in their power bills to make up for the loss of revenue. This is similar to a hospital seeking to ban fitness clubs because the members would be healthy and therefore need fewer visits to the hospital. There is a big battle brewing in Florida over the freedom to choose. Conservatives and progressives have come together to fight for free-market principles in energy. They are pushing for a Constitutional amendment that would provide Floridians the choice to purchase solar-generated electricity from a non-utility solar provider – up to 2 megawatts in size. This gives Florida’s families and businesses the right to freely engage in commerce of solar power and take greater control of their energy future. That does not sit well with companies like Florida Power and Light (FPL) and other electric companies, who have turned to their close allies like Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and James Taylor of Heartland Institute to keep Floridians shackled to these powerful monopolies. FPL has even hatched an alternative solar ballot initiative intended to confuse voters and derail the Floridians for Solar Choice ballot initiative. Conservatives are out front fighting back against the covert attempts at deception by FPL and its allies. We polled 600 Florida registered voters in October of 2014. Our polling data showed that 71% of Florida Republican Primary voters support third-party sales of solar power. Our message is winning. Free-market principles are cherished by conservatives, and they don’t like the unrestricted power granted to these powerful monopolies by the government. If you show conservatives that solar is the perfect vehicle to advance competition in energy, you would be surprised at just how receptive they are. My home state of Georgia is a very “red” state but solar is flourishing there, recently ranked at the top for creating new solar jobs. The big surprise is that solar has advanced because of the leadership of conservative Republican elected officials like “Bubba” McDonald and Representative Michael Dudgeon. Georgia just passed a third-party solar bill that sailed through the legislature without one dissenting vote. That’s quite an accomplishment in this day of partisanship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T10:13:02Z","webTitle":"The entrepreneurs turning carbon dioxide into fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis","fields":{"headline":"The entrepreneurs turning carbon dioxide into fuels","bodyText":"In an industrial greenhouse about 30km from Zurich, plump aubergines and juicy cherry tomatoes are ripening to perfection. Growing Mediterranean crops in Switzerland would traditionally be energy intensive but these vegetables are very nearly carbon-neutral. The greenhouse uses waste energy from a nearby refuse plant, and carbon dioxide from the world’s first commercial direct air capture plant. The facility, designed by Zurich-based start-up Climeworks, pumps the gas into greenhouses to boost the plants’ photosynthesis and increase their yield, it hopes, by up to 20%. Climeworks says it will extract around 900 tonnes of CO2 a year from the air. The company’s end game is not plumper tomatoes but something far more ambitious – proving that carbon dioxide can be recycled from the atmosphere and turned into something useful. If this installation is a success, Climeworks wants to sell its concentrated carbon dioxide to companies producing carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels. With concentrations of CO2 at their highest in the last 400,000 years, the world needs to remove the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere – as well as cut emissions – if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. Of course, nature has been recycling carbon dioxide for millions of years. Photosynthesis turns sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into sugars which fuel plants, which provide us with food, wood and complex sugars for fuel. But most plants turn less than 1% of the solar energy they receive into useful energy-rich compounds. Scientists and entrepreneurs are working on technologies that they hope will improve on nature and make recycling carbon dioxide a profitable industry. The World Economic Forum and Scientific American recently named an artificial leaf as one of the top emerging technologies of 2017. Dan Nocera, a chemist at Harvard University, is one of the scientists working on developing this “leaf”, which looks like a small, plain computer chip. Nocera’s leaf has an energy efficiency of around 10%, according to his paper published last year in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal. It has two processes. The first is an electrochemical system that uses metal catalysts and electricity from solar panels to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Then the hydrogen, along with carbon dioxide, is fed to bacteria commonly found in soil and water. The bacteria convert the gases into alcohols like methanol and ethanol that are the precursors to liquid fuels. These “solar fuels” – so called because they are made from nothing more than sunlight, water and air – could be a carbon neutral drop-in replacement for today’s fossil fuels. Nocera’s ultimate vision is a cheap, standalone solar-powered system for developing countries to turn water into fuel for vehicles, cooking or power generation. His initial target market is India, where he hopes local scientists and entrepreneurs will help to commercialise the system, although he admits that his technology is years from commercialisation. In the meantime, several start-ups are trying to beat Nocera to a practical system to recycle CO2 into useful products. Like Nocera’s leaf, all are designed to run on a trickle of electricity from solar panels. In 2015, Staff Sheehan left Yale University and founded Catalytic Innovations to use metal catalysts like Nocera’s to turn carbon dioxide and water into ethanol, a biofuel that is already added to petrol in many countries to reduce its carbon footprint. Another start-up, Opus 12, recently spun out of Stanford University in Silicon Valley says it’s “recreating photosynthesis, but at warp speed”. The company says its tech can be used at any source of CO2 emissions to produce syngas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be burned like natural gas or used to produce a range of industrial chemicals. And at the annual American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC last month, a small company called Dioxide Materials said that it had developed electrolysis technology that could split carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide – a precursor for methanol – with twice the efficiency of previous systems. In order for CO2 recycling systems to operate efficiently, however, the gas has to be captured and concentrated from sources such as factories and power stations – or extracted from the air using a system like Climeworks’. And that isn’t cheap. Capturing CO2 at a factory chimney could cost up to $80 per ton, according to research from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Extracting from thin air is pricier still. Climeworks says it currently costs around $600 to extract a ton of CO2, although it expects that price to halve in its second-generation plant. “Technologies to capture CO2 from the air, like Climeworks’ units, have the potential for the sort of steep price declines that we’ve seen from solar, wind, and batteries, which are also factory manufactured products,” says Matt Lucas of the Center for Carbon Removal, a non-profit dedicated to curtailing climate change. “But if we want to compete with gasoline,” says Sheehan, “that cost has to be practically nothing.” There are a couple of dozen large-scale projects underway to capture and store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, including a pilot in India turning CO2 into baking soda. However, the International Energy Agency says they are not on track to meet its objective for more than 100 projects by 2020. Another challenge is the swift change in the political climate. “Traditionally, solar-fuelled artificial photosynthesis has been a government-funded effort,” says Dick Co, director of the Solar Fuels Institute, a global team of scientists working to recycle CO2 into fuels. “But accelerated by the US election last year, we’re seeing a quick shift from government money to philanthropists like Bill Gates and Tom Steyer.” It’s unknown whether these philanthropists will be committed to funding solar fuels over the years and decades they will need to reach commercial reality. For young companies like Catalytic Innovations, that means seeking out every source of funding. Sheehan’s start-up has made it to the semi-finals of the NRG Cosia Carbon XPrize, a $20m competition to recycle waste carbon dioxide from power plants into valuable fuel or building materials. He is now looking for money to build a larger prototype in the hope of making it to the final round – which would come with half a million dollars seed money."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2017/mar/10/elon-musk-i-can-fix-south-australia-power-network-in-100-days-or-its-free","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-10T05:04:40Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk: I can fix South Australia power network in 100 days or it's free","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/10/elon-musk-i-can-fix-south-australia-power-network-in-100-days-or-its-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/mar/10/elon-musk-i-can-fix-south-australia-power-network-in-100-days-or-its-free","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk: I can fix South Australia power network in 100 days or it's free","bodyText":"Elon Musk, the billionaire co-founder of electric car giant Tesla, has thrown down a challenge to the South Australian and federal governments, saying he can solve the state’s energy woes within 100 days – or he’ll deliver the 100MW battery storage system for free. On Thursday, Lyndon Rive, Tesla’s vice-president for energy products, told the AFR the company could install the 100-300 megawatt hours of battery storage that would be required to prevent the power shortages that have been causing price spikes and blackouts in the state. Thanks to stepped-up production out of Tesla’s new Gigafactory in Nevada, he said it could be achieved within 100 days. Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian co-founder of Silicon Valley startup Atlassian, on Friday tweeted Elon Musk, asking if Tesla was serious about being able to install the capacity. Musk replied that the company could do it in 100 days of the contract being signed, or else provide it free, adding: “That serious enough for you?” SA Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young replied to Musk: “Let’s talk!” Rive, Musk’s cousin who co-founded with him the solar energy outfit SolarCity, had said Tesla’s battery technology could address the power shortfall from the Hazelwood power plant closure in Victoria, as well as SA’s blackouts. “We don’t have 300MWh sitting there ready to go but I’ll make sure there are,” he told the AFR. Tesla recently completed an installation of an 80MWh grid-scale battery farm in southern California within just 90 days, which cost $100m US. Repeated blackouts in SA since September last year have sparked a political brawl over energy policy, with the federal government blaming the failures on the use of renewable technologies. The most recent blackout was in early February the Australian Energy Market Operator said there were many factors behind it, including higher demand than anticipated. Grid scale battery storage could help to even out price spikes, prevent blackouts and improve reliability across the network. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) recently approved a $450,000 grant to EnergyAustralia to investigate a pumped hydro energy storage project in the Spencer Gulf. That project has a capacity to produce about 100MW with six to eight hours of storage. In comparison, Tumut 3 hydroelectric station, Australia’s largest pumped hydro storage, has a capacity of 1,500 megawatts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2020/apr/24/australia-coronavirus-latest-updates-nsw-victoria-queensland-covid-19-testing-scott-morrison-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-24T11:05:33Z","webTitle":"Fifth Covid-19 death at Sydney aged care home – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/24/australia-coronavirus-latest-updates-nsw-victoria-queensland-covid-19-testing-scott-morrison-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/24/australia-coronavirus-latest-updates-nsw-victoria-queensland-covid-19-testing-scott-morrison-latest-news","fields":{"headline":"Fifth Covid-19 death at Sydney aged care home – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing our live coronavirus coverage for the day. Thanks from me, Graham Readfearn, and from my colleagues Josh Taylor and Amy Remeikis. You can still follow events elsewhere on the Guardian’s global live blog. We’ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage. Here’s a summary of the day: Australia’s death toll from coronavirus rose to 79. Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales each announced a death. New case numbers remained low and Tasmania recorded no new cases for the first time in three weeks. Newmarch House in western Sydney announced a fifth death at the aged care facility. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulation. Testing criteria is being broadened across the country. Community sport could be one of the earliest activities to see restrictions lifted or eased. The national cabinet is working on a set of national principles to allow that to happen. Perth airport blocked four Virgin planes from being moved because the airline owes it $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. Stay safe and thanks again for being with us. Jimmy Barnes took a night off last night, but he’s back with more music from his lounge room. It’s a cover of the 1963 Burt Bacharach and Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, most famously recorded by the Carpenters in 1970. Night has fallen now across the entire continent. Usually hundreds of thousands of Australians would be up before sunrise tomorrow to join Anzac day dawn services and to honour those who serve and have served. But coronavirus means this year will be different. There won’t be any local marches or public services, but people will still be able to watch ceremonies live streamed from state RSL websites and on the ABC and other networks. But you can still take part if you choose to and RSL branches want people to still stand and remember at 6am, either in their homes, on their driveways, in their gardens or anywhere they’re allowed to go. Prof Frank Bongiorno, historian at Australian National University, wrote on the Guardian earlier today that the lack of public ceremony will represent a return to Anzac days of decades long gone. While the day has had its elements of public ritual since 1916, much early Anzac Day commemoration was private rather than public, sometimes conducted at the gravesides of Australian soldiers buried in cemeteries in Britain and Australia. Women were prominent in these efforts, honouring the memories of men they might or might not have known by placing flowers on their tombs. There are other echoes of the past. Anzac Day in 1919 was also disrupted by a major crisis in public health. In New South Wales, where the rate of infection from Spanish influenza was high and the number of deaths – approaching 1,000 by Anzac Day – was alarming, the government had banned public meetings. Several key developments emerged from the national cabinet meeting earlier today. Rules around aged care visits, hopes for a restart of community sport, clarification on jobkeeper payments and a repeat of medical advice for school classrooms all made for a busy day. My colleagues Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp have wrapped all the important details here. Australia’s total death toll from Covid-19 is now at 79 with another death confirmed an hour ago at a western Sydney aged care home. We told you about the death of a 96-year-old woman at the Newmarch House aged care facility, who was the third death confirmed today. A 79-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, died overnight in Tasmania. A man in his 70s died overnight in Western Australia. Here are the daily new case counts as confirmed by states and territories. South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have seen zero new cases. The ACT recorded 1 new case, Queensland 2, Western Australia 2, Victoria 6 and New South Wales recorded 7. Earlier today Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration issued infringement notices of $25,200 to celebrity chef Pete Evans, who claimed a fancy light box –sorry, “subtle energy platform” – could help treat coronavirus. The BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform was yours for just $14,990 from chef Pete. The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, has some comments about the fines. This celebrity chef can carry on all he likes about ‘activated almonds’ and whatever latest fad excites him but he should steer clear of health advice, particularly when it comes to something as serious as Covid-19. I welcome this decision and I hope that it gives pause for thought for anyone taking advantage of this pandemic to spread false and misleading nonsense on social media. I encourage all Australians to ignore his social media content. Please listen to the experts including your GP, we have your best interests at heart and we are doing all we can. As I have stated previously this ‘light machine’ doesn’t do anything but drain your wallet. However, the problem is that it may lull people into a false sense of security which means they don’t act as cautiously as they otherwise would on responsibilities such as social distancing. The various interested parties in the world of broadcasting professional rugby league are creeping closer to agreement. NRL broadcasters and the Australian Rugby League Commission have been in talks this afternoon. They’ve agreed the competition will start on 28 may, but AAP reports they still haven’t agreed the structure. From AAP: NRL television broadcasters Channel Nine and Foxtel have agreed to recognise May 28 as the competition recommencement date following extensive meetings. On Friday evening, ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys confirmed to AAP that the NRL and broadcasters would finalise a competition structure early next week, as both parties want different outcomes. “We were all united on the 28th May start. But just the competition structure we need a little more time, but we definitely announce it early next week,” he said. A 96-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid-19 has died at Newmarch House in western Sydney – the fifth death at the aged care home. Anglicare Sydney has confirmed the sad news in a statement, saying the woman had “multiple health issues”. Grant Millard, CEO of Anglicare Sydney, said: I am thankful that a close relative was able to visit her last night before she died. We grieve with the family, our staff who have cared for her, other residents who have come to know her, and everyone who has been thinking and praying for us during this difficult time. Please keep everyone in your thoughts and prayers. Schools in NSW go back next week under a model that has students in classrooms for a day a week, starting in week two. Craig Petersen, the acting president of the New South Wales Secondary Principals’ Council, is talking to the ABC. He says last night the NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant gave a briefing and “it’s quite clear that the transmission rate between children is absolutely negligible”. Petersen said: That is reassuring but we also have staff to consider and we do have a number of staff in schools who are aged or have underlying health conditions so we look how we can maintain that. The logistics of returning to school is something the principals will work hard and how to cater for HSC students .... And the reality is that any staggered return to school is going to be fraught with difficulty. We are really concerned about our HSC students, this is a big year for them and we want to minimise the disruption to their education and get them back on track as soon as we can but not losing track with other students. Some colleagues are working out how to get year 12 back more often than that, maybe 4 or five days out of the week in the early stages but it will depend on the local context and what is working for the students now. So it’s been pointed out to me that when the prime minister spoke earlier today about how the four square metre distancing rule didn’t apply to classrooms, this shouldn’t be a huge surprise. Chiefly, because he has said it before – on 21 April, he said: On schools, national cabinet was keen to reinforce the point as was made last week that the health advice is not, is not, in relation to schools that a four square metre per person rule be enforced in classrooms. That is not the advice of the medical expert panel and any suggestion that this is a requirement for schools is not the case. To be fair, the PM didn’t mention the 1.5 metre social distancing rule on 21 April, and he did today. But it’s also clear that classrooms haven’t been the subject of the same health advice as other situations for some time. Sydney beaches at Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly will open on Saturday and Sunday morning for three hours, but only if people are there to exercise. Between 6am and 9am, surfing, swimming and running is in. Hanging out and watching the world go by, isn’t. Randwick City Council said it would would reassess the situation on Monday. In a statement, the council said: All other unpatrolled beaches in Randwick City will remain closed until further notice. These beaches include Gordon’s Bay, Malabar beach, Little Bay beach, Frenchmans beach, Yarra Bay and Congwong beach. Ocean rock pools in Randwick City will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. Graham Readfearn here taking you through the rest of the day in coronavirus-related news. Earlier today, home affairs minister Peter Dutton had a crack at the Queensland government, saying kids in his state should be back at school. The reason they weren’t, claimed Dutton, was because premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was “running scared of the militant” Queensland Teachers’ Union. Well, QTU president Kevin Bates has just been talking to the ABC. An announcement earlier today from the national cabinet that the 1.5 metre distancing rule should no longer apply to schools has thrown the union’s position in the air. Bates said that the union “had not formed a position” on whether there could be return to full schooling before the end of this current term, which is finishing its first week today. If you had asked me that question yesterday, I would have potentially given you a different answer, because today the 1.5m social distancing rule has just disappeared. So you know, we’ve got this roller-coaster ride of changing conditions – we’re not making a decision on this in Queensland until the end of the next fortnight. We would need to look at all of the circumstances that are in play at that time to make a good decision about what the second half of the term would look like. Bates responded to the accusation his union was running the show saying they were only one of “almost 80 people” who were meeting almost daily for stakeholder meetings with the state’s Department of Education We are one of the stakeholders, we are a major stakeholder, we represent 48,000 teachers and principals in Queensland, but our voice is not the only one and the government obviously listens to what we have to say, and then they make their own decisions. We don’t always agree with everything they decide and this is one of those cases. But we are working with the government as we look towards what might happen in the second half of the term. I am now handing over to my colleague, Graham Readfearn, to take you through the evening. Police were forced to break up a protest against 5G in Mullumbimby in NSW due to the coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings. Around 100 people, seemingly unaware of the potential dangers of contracting coronavirus in large gatherings, were incorrectly claiming that 5G can affect immunity. “Especially in this age of coronavirus, you want to have your immunity as strong as you can,” 7News reported one of the protestors saying. We’ve confirmed, as the prime minister said earlier, that Amazon Web Services will host the data from the app within Australia (Sydney area to be exact). There’s been a lot of people quite concerned about using an American company for this, because of a US law that can force US-based companies to provide data they hold, even if they’re not located there. We’ll have more on that later, but government services minister Stuart Robert has said new laws will be enacted to make it a crime for Amazon to take the data overseas. “Keeping Australian data in Australia will be guaranteed through a determination through the Biosecurity Act and legislation. It will be a criminal offence to transfer data to any country other than Australia. A penalty of imprisonment for five years and/or 300 penalty units ($63,000) could apply to breaches of the direction,” he said. “The highly secure information storage system keys will be managed through Amazon Web Services’ Key Management System (KMS), a widely used security service that has been previously assessed by the ACSC. “This is exactly the same way the Australian government already uses AWS for many other agencies, including the work of our intelligence agencies, including ASD, and ensures Australian data stays in Australia.” One point, he said, was that Australia hadn’t signed up to participate in the US Cloud Act yet – except there is currently legislation before parliament to do just that. So more to come on this. In case you forgot, avid carnivore Pete Evans was recently seen promoting this Tardis console panel-looking device as a potential treatment for coronavirus. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has now fined Evans $25,200 (or roughly the cost of 1.5 of these machines) for claiming it could be used for coronavirus treatment. The TGA found there was “no foundation” to these claims. There were two infringement notices issued. One for the coronavirus claims, and one for the other claims made for this Back to the Future-looking device, including that it could “restore strength, stamina, coordination and mental clarity”. “As the BioCharger device has been represented by the company as being for therapeutic uses, it is a therapeutic good within the meaning of the act, and is subject to the regulatory framework established under the act and administered by the TGA,” the TGA said. “Unless a specific exemption applies, therapeutic goods must be entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be lawfully supplied or advertised in Australia.” The emergency laws that passed Victorian parliament yesterday as part of the state’s response to the coronavirus should be overseen by an independent committee, human rights commissioner Kristen HIlton has said. Hilton, who is the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner, said some of the measures introduced in the Covid-19 Omnibus (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 would have an impact on human rights, particularly changes relating to the management of prisons, the restriction of visitors, and changes to the way court proceedings are carried out. She said those impacts were reasonable but must be closely monitored. “During a state of emergency, some limitations on human rights may be unavoidable – and these are not decisions we can take lightly. Any restriction on human rights must be necessary, justifiable, proportionate and time-bound,” Hilton said. She added: “The government should establish an independent committee to scrutinise the response, that is informed by human rights expertise and can hear directly from the public. This is critical in maintaining public confidence and transparency.” The Victorian opposition called for the establishment of such a committee, but the deputy Nationals leader, Steph Ryan, said the government refused to establish a committee with a non-government majority. Hilton said the Victorian Government had filed a statement of compatibility, to show that the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities had been carefully considered in the drafting of the laws, but that did not do away with the need for continual monitoring and independent oversight. Perth airport says it has blocked four Virgin planes from being moved because the airline owes it $16m in airfield and terminal use fees. An airport spokeswoman said Qantas has also “unilaterally” refused to pay $20m in fees, although there’s no sign of any bulldozers in front of jets sporting the flying kangaroo yet. The spokeswoman said: “Virgin has significant outstanding invoices from Perth airport for airfield and terminal use charges – money the airline has already collected from its passengers and the FIFO sector. “While Perth airport is working with the Virgin administrators, it also needs to protect its own interests. “Perth airport has taken liens over a number of Virgin aircraft – a standard practice in these situations.” The terminal Virgin usually uses,T1, is closed and the planes in question aren’t currently in use due to the coronavirus crisis. But Virgin continues to operate charter flights from T2 for the Fifo – fly-in-fly-out – workers in Western Australia’s mining industry. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says privacy concerns about the contact tracing app need to be addressed. He says the parliament will also scrutinise the legislation supporting the app. “We will be scrutinising the legislation carefully that the government has said they will provide it to us in advance and we will be ensuring that privacy concerns are met. It can be, obviously, a very useful tool. The medical experts have said that.” He says the parliamentary committees should have access to the legislation before it hits parliament to speed up the process of passing it in the second week of May. Gilbert ends the interview by saying Australia’s in a very good position in dealing with coronavirus. “Better than most, let’s keep it that way,” Morrison replies. Morrison won’t be drawn on whether the government will consider broadening or raising the GST as part of the rebound effort post coronavirus pandemic. He says everything should be on the table, but the goal should be jobs, investment and growth. “You don’t have to put people’s taxes up,” he says. On the contact tracing app, Morrison says people should not be worried about it. “This has one job and that is to help that health officer sitting in that office in Sydney or Melbourne...” He compares it to the manual contact tracing method (which relies on human memory, not a recorded list of everyone you’ve been around). “We’ve put the protections in place. You download the app, you’re making yourself safer, you’re making your family safer, and you’re making the community safer.” He says it is up to Australians to get to that 40% uptake, and he says he will be downloading the app himself. The app will be out “very soon”, he says. “It is hurting, it is hurting hard,” Morrison says, about the economic impact. Yes there are another three weeks before restrictions will be potentially eased, but states are moving already. He says if they can do it even a day earlier they will, but he doesn’t want to open everything up and then have to close it down again, which would cost more. Good afternoon, everyone. Prime minister Scott Morrison is being interviewed by Sky News’ Kieran Gilbert. Morrison says Australia is in a much better position now than the national cabinet thought we would be when it was first convened. He says it is “possible” to eliminate coronavirus entirely, but an eradication strategy is “everyone getting under the doona and not getting out” and you can’t run a country like that. On that note, I will hand you over to Josh Taylor for the next little bit. Thank you again for joining us this week. It means a lot. Stay well this weekend – and take care of you. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck has put out a statement on the aged care edicts Scott Morrison was talking about: Aged care minister Richard Colbeck says while providers shared a responsibility to protect the wellbeing of senior Australians in care, total lockdowns of facilities were not supported by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) or the national cabinet. It follows calls by Prime Minister Scott Morrison who reminded providers not to impose tougher visitor restrictions. Age care providers that wish to have an exemption from the national arrangements should seek authority through the commonwealth. ... But Minister Colbeck said the call to work to the AHPPC recommendations was not a green light to go back to pre-Covid visitation routines. It is also recommended that all aged care workers and visitors have their flu vaccinations by 1 May. Anthony Albanese will hold his press conference at 3.20pm You may have seen the prime minister and the chief medical officer talk about masks as part of that press conference about an hour or so ago. Labor’s Andrew Leigh says they need to be made available to charities, writing to Greg Hunt to ask the government to provide them: I note recent reports that the government has been able to replenish stockpiles of personal protective equipment. Australian charities are working hard to maintain vital services to vulnerable Australians – providing, for example, acute mental health support, emergency relief and disability support – and in many cases are facing increased costs to provide staff and volunteers with appropriate protective equipment. Services provided by frontline charities will have increasing importance to the community as physical distancing measures continue. Yet at a time when demand on many services is increasing, donations and program-based revenue is falling. On top of this financial strain, the need to provide adequate safety equipment has left many charities with a choice of either spending scarce resources to purchase personal protective equipment at a commercial rate in a sellers’ market, or discontinuing services in spite of increased demand. While our healthcare workers rightly have the highest priority claim on the commonwealth’s reserves of personal protective equipment, I urge you to work with representatives in the charity and community sector to create pathways for not-for-profit providers of vital support services to get access to stockpiled equipment. These organisations are playing an important role in keeping vulnerable Australians healthy and socially connected. Supporting expert service providers to stay active in our communities will be beneficial for all. And it is not just charities. Aged care “in house” workers – who may not be nurses, but take care of the showering and feeding needs, or in some cases go into people’s homes for community care, are also crying out for masks. One of the issues with aged care is the tight margins facilities operate with, so that is not only impacting staffing levels, but also, the equipment being provided. It’s not just Coogee – Maroubra and Clovelly have been closed again, as well. The restrictions have impacted a lot of people’s lives in ways you wouldn’t think of, until you are experiencing it yourself. Here is another way I know a lot of families are dealing with right now The ACCC says 7-Eleven stores do not have to be trading 7-Eleven (or any other hours) if they don’t want to: 7-Eleven and its franchisees have been granted conditional interim authorisation to discuss potential temporary store closures or reduced trading hours in light of reduced customer demand because of Covid-19 restrictions. 7-Eleven owns and operates stores in competition with its franchisees in some areas and therefore discussions and agreements between them risk breaching the competition laws. “We recognise that 7-Eleven and its franchisees are facing difficult trading conditions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and believe this cooperation could help the network and individual stores to remain viable,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. “Importantly, franchisees are not required to temporarily close or reduce their store hours if they do not wish to. Our decision to grant interim authorisation does not force franchisees to agree to the terms offered by 7-Eleven.” Franchisees that agree to close temporarily will receive an ex-gratia payment from 7-Eleven to cover certain unavoidable operational costs. For franchisees that agree to reduce their hours, the minimum guaranteed income that the franchisee receives from 7-Eleven would be pro-rata adjusted to reflect the temporary reduction in trading hours. The Law Council still has some reservations about the tracing app, and has suggested the government adhere to some principles to make everyone feel a little better about it: With the government’s Covid-19 tracing app in development, the Law Council of Australia is calling for the adoption of core design principles to be included within the legislative framework, designed to govern the operation of the app. Placing the app on legislative foundations will ensure that the parameters for the app’s use are clear, certain, legally effective and not susceptible to removal or amendment by unilateral executive action. ... The series of core principles include clear governing laws and administrative frameworks, adoption of a voluntary ‘opt-in’ model, limitations on the collection of users’ personal information, a prohibition on any secondary use or disclosure of information collected by the app, security of personal information, and limited use of de-identified information for specified public health purposes amongst others. See the Core Principles document. If you need even more Scott Morrison on your Friday, he will be on Sky News at 3pm. Here is what Coogee beach looked like this morning, before it was closed again. Prof Brendan Murphy barely contained his laughter when asked about this. And then remembered he was on national television The prime minister finishes his press conference by effectively saying he expects everyone to be out on their driveways at dawn, for the Anzac dawn service. Other than that, I will see everyone tomorrow morning at 5.30. I will be at the national War Memorial. Everyone else will be at home. At 6.00 I look forward to the entire nation, on their driveways, lighting up the dawn, remembering our heroes and drawing inspiration from them for the task and challenge we currently face. Thank you very much. Scott Morrison finishes his press conference with a reminder that parliament is returning on 12, 14 and 13 May. I met with the opposition last night, our regular weekly get-together. On the Wednesday of that week, there will also be the Federation Chamber operating in the House of Representatives. The arrangements that we’ve had in place for the other days of sittings will be pursued when we return in more or less the same form, ensuring the chamber operates with the appropriate social distancing. But I anticipate we’ll see a lot more members back in the Parliament House, but obviously they can’t all be in the chamber at the one time. Or, indeed, in the Federation Chamber at the one time. The business of the parliament in that week, it will be the ordinary business of the parliament. The ACT has recorded one new case of Covid-19 in the past 14 hours. Authorities are working out how he contracted the virus. And then the nation gets another dose of guilt about civic duty when it comes to the tracing app, as Scott Morrison talks about how the national cabinet is looking at lifting the restrictions: What we also want to be careful of, and this is why we’re doing it in a very sort of incremental, iterative way as a national cabinet, is what we don’t want to see is a stop-start approach to our road back. This is why getting in place the sentinel testing, the testing regime, the contact tracing, which is very much helped by this app, this health app, a public health app that helps health workers help you, we need this so we can have the protections in place for you, your family, so you can get back to work, so you can get your kids back to school, so you can get back into community sport – that is what this app helps you do. That’s what it’s designed to do. That’s why we’ve been so direct about it and so careful about its construction and the protections that are there. And to have this, as you say in your question, this rapid response that can deal with the condition on the ground, of course there will be outbreaks. I think we can anticipate that. But where you have the response capability and the AUSMAT teams and other quite well-trained and highly qualified people to go and seal off those outbreaks, then you can keep the rest of the country moving at the same time. That is our much preferred position. You know, you don’t want to go on a stop-start basis, and that’s why you’ve gotta be careful when you come to relax some of these restrictions. On why he wants people back in workplaces, Scott Morrison says: I would love to see a return to normal right across the board. Of course we want to see that. And that includes people going to work in offices. And that’s an important part of how our economy functions. I mean, there are some people who can work from home, and for whom this period of time has been less of an inconvenience to them than it has to many others. But I can – I’m sure you’d know that if you’re a parent at home, trying to work from home and you’ve also got the kids at home, and they’re trying to learn, it’s not working too well for you. And your productivity isn’t doing too well either. And so when we can get back to the point where we can have kids back at school, and we can get people back at work, then I think we’re gonna see that also lift our economy in ways that we very much need. Because we want our economy to support businesses and jobs, not government through subsidies and income support payments and things of that nature. I mean, our social security net will always be there for those who need it. But our preference and priority is always to ensure that our economy is what supports people’s livelihoods. And that’s what we need again. Prof Brendan Murphy is barely holding back incredulous laughter when asked if anyone should follow Donald Trump’s latest brain fart about dealing with the coronavirus – which was basically injecting disinfectant (kill it with bleach! and yourself!) and blasting yourself with massive amounts of UV light (kill it by giving yourself cancer!). Murphy: Um ... I would not ... I would caution against the injection of disinfection! They could be quite toxic to people. I wasn’t privy to his comments, so I want to be very careful about commenting on something that I didn’t hear myself. And ultraviolet light, look, I don’t know the context in which he said it, so I really would need to study it before I could comment, thank you. My dad used to clean my cuts with Pine-o-cleen because it saved money and he figured one disinfectant was as good as another, but even he would draw the line at injecting it. On the issues with the implementation of the jobkeeper wage subsidy, Scott Morrison says it is something which is being addressed: We’re working closely, as the treasurer is, in particular, as is the tax commissioner, on the implementation issues around jobkeeper. And let’s also remember that where jobkeeper doesn’t apply, jobseeker does kick in. So, these two work together, and that’s always been important. Jobkeeper was never intended to be a catch-all for every Australian worker, or a worker who had their hours significantly reduced or, indeed, was stood down. It was intended to be there as an important element of the income support that we put in place, and the lifeline to businesses and to keep people connected to businesses. But where that can’t be in place because of arrangements that we’ve set to ensure that we manage these issues well, not just administratively but fiscally, then jobseeker is available. As I said, we’re approaching now almost 600,000 claims for jobseeker over these last five or so weeks, which has been quite an effort on their part. And, again, I thank those who have made claims, and those who are still awaiting for their claims to be processed for their patience. Queensland has announced it will look at whether the school restrictions need to be extended beyond the fifth week of term two, which is around mid-May. But anyone who wants to send their child to school, can. They are open. Parents have been advised to talk to principals if they have any concerns. I know, because my sister is a public school teacher in Queensland. And also, because I pay attention to press conferences. In response to this tweet Scott Morrison says the home affairs minister is just “expressing his opinion as a local”. Well, look, I’d simply say that Peter, of course, is a minister in my government, but he’s also a Queenslander. And these are issues that are being debated and addressed in Queensland. And whether you’re a local member, a minister or just any old Queenslander, then you do get to have the right to have a view as a local. And I’m sure that’s the context in which Peter’s expressed those views. How does the chief medical officer see restrictions being lifted for gatherings, as well as travel? I mean, there may be a situation where a country has effectively eliminated or got very low cases. For example, New Zealand, we might have a situation where it could be relaxed. But if you’re coming from a country where there is significant community transmission, I think that the impact - you’ve seen the graphs. The impact of our quarantine measures on what’s happened in Australia has been huge. Clearly the national cabinet has asked us to come back with a range of potential recommendations for gently, carefully, cautiously relaxing distancing measures. And, of course, the size of gatherings will be in that mix. But I don’t want to pre-empt the decisions of national cabinet. But we will be making recommendations. Similar to those that you’re talking about. And they’ll be coming to national cabinet. It will be their decision. Scott Morrison moves to address some more concerns about the tracing app – namely where the server will be situated: The server is in Australia and it’s using AWS, who work with Australia on many, many sensitive issues. In terms of Australia’s data management. It’s a nationally encrypted data store. It is illegal - it will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than that for whom the whole thing is designed, and that is to support the health worker in the state to be able to undertake the contact tracing, with the data that they access being released by the individual for whom is the subject of the contact tracing. Although people would probably be feeling much more comfortable with the idea of the app if the government hadn’t passed “national security” legislation which allows the government to force tech companies to build secret backdoors into apps, which can be accessed, without anyone knowing. I am not saying that is happening here, but I am saying trust is low for a reason. A lot of jurisdictions have already done this – but testing will be extended across the nation, to ensure any community transmission is being picked up, Professor Brendan Murphy says: In particular, national cabinet was informed today that every single jurisdiction has now – every state and territory has now broadened their testing criteria from today. Some did it earlier. So that anybody with acute respiratory symptoms – cough, sore throat, runny nose, cold symptoms, flu-like symptoms – can get tested. This will significantly expand the population of people tested. We’re pretty confident that most of them will be negative, but this will give us a really broad reach of what we call passive surveillance. But we’re also looking at a range of active surveillance mechanisms to test even people without symptoms in a range of frontline occupations and a range of what we call sentinel situations, where we sample the population. National cabinet is very clear that they want to be absolutely confident before relaxing any measures that we are in a position in this country to detect any community transmission of any significance. Scott Morrison then moves to how Australia has moved into the “community phase” of monitoring the spread of Covid-19, where it has to watch for community transmission: We now have to be wary against community transmission, and so we are dealing with that third wave of the virus. We will also be then working towards decisions that we have to make over the next few weeks, getting the key data metrics in place as to how we’ll make decisions on further easing of restrictions. We are, though, I confirm, seeing states and territories individually waiving various parts of the restrictions they have put in place above the baselines. They’re making those announcements almost on a daily basis. We welcome that, whether it’s in schools or in other areas, and we can expect to see that happen over the next few weeks. The national cabinet will meet next Friday again. Sorry for the slight delay - my computer had a slight meltdown. Back to the press conference, Scott Morrison says it is time for aged care facilities to start allowing visits, if they are not already, or face having to get commonwealth permission for changing the arrangements: On aged care, there is a meeting this evening, a webinar, and national cabinet has continued to stress its concern about restrictions that are being put in place in aged care facilities, as I noted earlier this week, beyond the baseline requirements of what national cabinet has agreed, based on the expert medical advice. So, we are flagging – I am flagging very clearly at a federal level – that should we not see an improvement in this area, under the voluntary arrangements that we currently have in place, that the commonwealth would be moving to require aged care facilities that wish to have an exemption to those national principles, those national arrangements, then they would need to seek authority to do that from the commonwealth, and we would make such a decision in consultation with the relevant state and territory jurisdiction. Now, there are quite valid reasons why you would have exemptions, particularly as we’ve seen in north-west Tasmania at the moment, or what we’ve seen in western Sydney or in other places. That is entirely sensible as to why you would have restrictions that are greater than the national baseline in those circumstances. Totally reasonable. But more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that’s not OK. And so let’s see how the industry goes with that. We would very much like to keep these things on a basis where aged care facilities are exercising their proper discretion. But we are not going to have these as secret places, where people can’t access them. We will see some new modelling during this Meanwhile, as Scott Morrison talks of opening public spaces up once again, Coogee beach is once again closed: On the theme of ‘national principles’, there are also safe workplace national principles on the way. Scott Morrison: This is all about getting Australians back to work, and ensuring that when they go back to work that they and their families can feel safe in going back to work, and to ensure that there are important principles in place, there are protocols and procedures that, should a Covid case present in a workplace, then the rules that people need to follow... The minister for industrial relations has been working closely with the Covid commission, union representatives and others to ensure we get helpful tools in place. On exercise and training, Scott Morrison says “national principles” will be released: The first, at the elite and professional level. So, the major sporting codes, our Olympic sports, training arrangements that sit around support for those activities, by elite sportspeople. Secondly, at the community competitive sport level. That is such an important part of our way of life here in Australia, and the principles that can help guide decisions by states and territories in the future. And, thirdly, at the individual passive level of sport and recreation. Activities from everything from - whether it’s in the shire, if you’re going surfing, or if you’re walking in the local national park, or whatever it might happen to be, those set of principles that states and territories can draw on in terms of getting some consistency across the country as we move into this next phase. Scott Morrison on schools: On schools, confirmation – and this is in the medical expert advice – the AHPPC’s document being released today – confirmation that the 4 sq metre rule, and the 1.5m distancing between students during classroom activities is not appropriate and not required. I can’t be more clear than that. The advice cannot be more clear than that. The 1.5m in classrooms and the 4 sq metre rule is not a requirement of the expert medical advice in classrooms. Scott Morrison on wearing of masks: On a couple of quite specific issues, on the wearing of masks, and Brendan Murphy, the professor, will talk a little bit more about this. But on the wearing of masks, the medical expert panel, we accepted their advice that it is not recommended by the expert panel that they are necessary to be worn, and importantly, it’s important to note that the wearing of such a mask does not protect you from an infection, but if you are displaying respiratory symptoms then it is, at best, a measure that prevents you transferring it to others. It’s not about protecting you from infection, but that’s why, when people were leaving airports and things of that nature, they were wearing it to prevent the transmission. The tracing app is on its way. Scott Morrison: There are still some issues we’re working through late in the piece, which is to be expected. We’re not too far away now. Earlier this week, as I indicated to you, it received the in-principle support of the national cabinet and we have been taking that through its final stages in recent days. That will be also an important tool for the country as we seek to manage how we live in a Covid-safe economy and community into the future. And the rapid response to individual outbreaks – we should be aware, as a community right across the country, that when we take further steps to ease restrictions, of course, we will continue to see outbreaks. That is to be expected. What matters is being able to move on them quickly. The prime minister starts the press conference by passing on the national cabinet’s and the nation’s, condolences to the families of the four Victorian police officers who were killed on Wednesday night, during a traffic stop. The Nine Network’s Charles Croucher had this lovely story last night. I don’t think anyone would be surprised to see the industries which have been hardest hit so far The national cabinet meeting has ended. Scott Morrison will give an update at 1pm. Western Australia authorities have reported a passenger on the Artania cruise ship, who was being treated for Covid-19, died overnight. The man, aged in his 70s, is the eighth person to die in WA and the 78th person to die in Australia, after a Covid-19 diagnosis. We heard yesterday that so far, almost $4bn has been withdrawn from super funds, from people struggling under financial pressure because of the Covid-19 crisis. There will be another round opened up in the next financial year. The average withdrawal has been $8,000. But how much will that cost when you want to retire? The select Senate committee looking at the Covid-19 response will hold another hearing next week. Treasury will be up then. In the meantime, the transcript from yesterday, which featured Prof Brendan Murphy and officials from the health department, is up. Food security in remote Indigenous communities is a problem at the best of times, but it has been exacerbated by the coronavirus, to the point where people have been unable to source essentials for weeks in some communities. A group of 13 Aboriginal organisations from across the Northern Territory this week called on the national cabinet to do more to guarantee food security for remote communities. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, convened a second round table of the major supermarkets, the NT government and the community stores, to guarantee supply. Coles announced today it has donated more than 80 pallets, or about 50 tonnes of food and grocery essentials, to remote communities across the Northern Territory this week. The packages include fresh and tinned produce, pasta, rice, biscuits and breakfast cereals. “Spring water, toilet paper, nappies and sanitary items will also be delivered to residents in Darwin, Alice Springs and to many remote communities such as Santa Teresa, Beswick and Elliott, which is 735 km away from a Coles store,” a spokesman said in a statement about the delivery. Sarah Hanson-Young has a bit to say in a statement about the removal of environmental “red tape” during this pandemic: The Morrison government has declared war with the environment with its announcement it plans to cut ‘green tape’ even before the 10-year review of environmental laws is completed, the Greens say. Greens spokesperson for the environment Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: ‘Using the cover of Covid-19 as an excuse to scrap environmental protections is an act of bastardry, and everyday Australians will be appalled. ‘This anti-environment government has always had cuts to environmental protections in favour of its big business mates on its agenda. ‘They seem to think Australians are distracted enough by the Covid-19 pandemic they won’t notice this latest attack. But I’ve got news for the environment minister, Australians care about the environment now more than ever and won’t take this lying down. ‘Trying to cut environmental protections to give big business, who donate to major political parties, easy access to cut down, dig up and trample the environment in the name of economic stimulus after a global pandemic is shameful. ‘We need stronger environmental laws, not weaker ones. The EPBC Act is already failing in its purpose of protection conservation and biodiversity with flora and fauna continuing to become threatened species and even going extinct. ‘Fast-tracking applications will do even more damage. As it is, only about 2 per cent of applications under the EPBC Act get knocked back. Federal court judge John Middleton has decided to allow administrators of Virgin Australia to avoid personal liability for the stricken airline’s $1.2bn in aircraft leases for a month. Middleton has also allowed the administrators, Vaughan Strawbridge, Salvatore Algeri, John Greig and Richard Hughes, of accounting firm Deloitte, to hold a meeting of creditors next Thursday by videolink and correspond with creditors by email. At a hearing this morning - itself held by videoline - Middleton said that any interested party that objected to the orders could come to the court and he would hear them on short notice. Middleton said he could himself turn out to be a creditor of Virgin Australia because he has booked flights to be taken in July. He said he also held points in Virgin’s frequent flyer scheme, Velocity, which is not in administration, and was a member of the airline’s lounge club. Got a sniffle and live in NSW? The government would love it if you got tested for Covid. From the NSW health release: The NSW government is urging anyone experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 to be tested in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Covid-19 symptoms include: · Fever; · Cough; · Tiredness (fatigue); · Sore throat; · Shortness of breath. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today announced there is now capacity to double the number of Covid-19 tests from around 4,000 tests per day to 8,000. And within that report The Parliamentary Budget Office has a new report out - this one on unlegislated measures carried forward into budget estimates. It is before any of the Covid measures were in place though, so don’t expect to find that. With all the talk about new ideas for the Australian economy, Anthony Albanese was also pressed on what he thought needed to happen, while on Melbourne radio 3AW this morning. Here is what he came up with: Hydrogen is an industry that can absolutely power steel and can power aluminium. How about we look at, for example, in Gladstone, they’re looking at, Rio Tinto own the aluminium refinery there, what they want to do is to power that up with solar energy in order to operate. They reckon they can double their capacity. ... One of the things that we could look at, for example, is go back to the Henry Tax Review. And one of the things that it said was that when you look at tax, you change behaviour. What sort of behaviour do we want? ... For example, rather than looking at just company tax cuts, I think what makes far more sense is to look at how do we encourage investment in Australia that creates jobs by companies. Neil Mitchell didn’t waste any time with his opening question to Anthony Albanese this morning: Mitchell: Is Scott Morrison doing a good job? Albanese: Look, I think the Australian people are doing a good job. And when the prime minister has got together with the state premiers and territory leaders, it is a good thing that we are getting more cooperation than we have historically in our federation system. I think … listening to the medical experts has been good. And that engagement has been constructive. I think that it is a good thing, for example, and I met with the prime minister and other senior ministers last night. So we are spending just over $90m on emergency fuel stock and $2.5m on storage for the fuel, to keep it in America, because we have nowhere to store it onshore. Which completely goes against the point of having an emergency fuel store. The point of the store being that if there is a conflict, or supply chains are cut, you have fuel on hand. Which Australia does not. Because it will be in America. baby steps. Mathias Cormann has released the latest spendings: This week I made $94 million in additional funding available to support the government’s purchase of oil stocks and the leasing of storage capacity in the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve by using the Advance to the Finance Minister. One determination of $91.5 million for purchasing oil was made from the Advance which was appropriated by the parliament in the Appropriation Act (No. 6) 2019-2020; and A second determination of $2.5 million for leasing storage was made from the Advance which was appropriated by the parliament in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2019-2020. Both determinations were signed yesterday. The determinations were registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, together with an Explanatory Statement (these will be available on legislation.gov.au). Given the writings of former prime ministers are in vogue, here’s the latest from the 28th: This seems pretty to the point: Police in Victoria appear to be continuing the trend of slapping anyone who is out allegedly conducting another crime with a fine for breaching social distancing laws. This seems to be a liberal interpretation of the public health orders unless you want to argue that robbers, like other professionals, should be working from home during this period. In the past 24 hours police have issued 54 on-the-spot fines. Recipients included three men fined for attending a birthday party in Romsey, four men and one woman who were spotted together at Winchelsea football oval, and “multiple people committing criminal offences, including robberies, vehicle theft and drug related offences”. This is interesting, given that Australia is taking some of the TraceTogether code base for its own app (some, not all): Six more Victorians have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. As we heard about a week ago, a mental health worker had been diagnosed with the virus, which authorities were keeping an eye on, given their contacts. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, confirmed a mental health facility (unnamed) had seen a cluster of cases, with 14 people linked to the facility now diagnosed with Covid-19. “Five are patients, five are staff and four are household close contacts,” she said. “Further testing will be undertaken today to determine if there is any further spread.” During the Sars epidemic, civet cats were thought to be one of the vectors which led to that virus being transmitted to humans. The evidence is very scant when it comes to Covid-19, but the World Health Organisation has previously said that cats don’t seem to be playing a major role in transmission to humans, but can catch the virus from people. Dogs, so far, seem to be OK. It is the first time in about three weeks that Tasmania has recorded no new cases. But given the devastation the virus can cause in that community particularly, Peter Gutwein has decided to extend the strict lockdown restrictions, which have been in place in the north-west, for another week. They had been due to be lifted this weekend. Gutwein says there needs to be more testing done, before they can risk it. That’s why today, following advice from Public Health, we have taken the extremely difficult decision to extend the additional restrictions, the additional retail restrictions that are in place on the north-west coast, out for another week until next Sunday, 3 May. It’s not a decision that is taken lightly. I know many in the north-west will be unhappy about this. But we need to get on top of this. We need to stamp this out. We need to crush this virus. We need to understand right across the community if this virus is there, and importantly to track and trace it aggressively. While there is certainly promising signs that the north-west is coming under control, an additional week of deeper testing will ensure that we have a very clear understanding of what’s occurring right across the coast and it will be our best opportunity to ensure that we have this outbreak completely under control and, importantly, if there are pockets to stamp them out as quickly as we possibly can. I would ask that the people of the north-west bear with us. But Peter Gutwein said there had been no new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in Tasmania in the last 24 hours. He said that news, combined with the death of another Tasmanian, was conflicting: To the woman’s family, friends and loved ones – I’m sorry. On behalf of the government, I extend our condolences and sympathies to you all. To lose someone else is just an absolute tragedy. It brings the total to nine lives lost in the state to the virus in past months. As I’ve continually said, there will be bad days. But there will also be better days as well. Today, unfortunately, is another one of those bittersweet moments. To stand here and have to announce that we’ve lost another life is something that gives me deep concern and is, you know, again, something that I must admit troubles me deeply. I find it very difficult to do. However, what it does do, it sharpens my resolve to get on top of this and stamp out this insidious virus. Tasmania has recorded another death, after a 79-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, passed away overnight. She is the ninth person to have died in Tasmania after contracting Covid-19. Anzac Day is going to look very different tomorrow, from what we have become used to since the Howard years. There will be no flag waving crowds, or thumping displays of nationalism. There will be commemorations and quiet reflections. And, of course, biscuits. The only answer here is chewy. Obviously. Unless you like bad biscuits. In which case, I cannot help you. Of all the sport hub ideas for a post-restrictions Australia, this really seems like a no-brainer: (via AAP) Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir has backed a Victorian push to host a quarantine hub in a bid to restart the AFL season. All states and territories are being considered by the AFL to set-up a hub to ensure the competition resumes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The AFL is weighing up whether to put together one hub for all 18 clubs, or spreading teams across Australia in multiple locations. Most states, including Western Australia through premier Mark McGowan, have already declared their interest in setting up a hub. But first-year Dockers mentor Longmuir believes Victoria would have an advantage over his home state with 14 days of quarantine required for anyone entering Western Australia. Travel restrictions between states are not in place for Victoria and NSW. In the meantime, I will continue to wish for NRL island to be a thing. Maybe forever. All signs point to schools resuming on-site learning by mid-May: Back on the carbon price, because it is something you are going to hear a lot about in coming months. Don’t expect the final term to include the words “carbon price”. Anthony Albanese, in his interview with the ABC, said the market had moved beyond what the Gillard-Rudd government had promoted: What I’m saying is that you did need a price signal a decade ago. There has been a change now so that renewables are not just competitive, they are, in fact, the cheapest form of new energy production. And in terms of what you have seen is a bizarre circumstance where by the government have been talking about subsidising a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland and indeed have made a substantial contribution for a company to study themselves whether their project is viable or not. That shows the way that the market itself has changed. The government hasn’t changed its rhetoric, and they need to do so. They need to listen to the science and acknowledge that we do need to act on climate change. We need to drive down our emissions and there are, indeed, advantages for employment in doing that. It is good environmental policy, but it is also good economic policy. While we are talking about the future, Mathias Cormann spoke to Laura Jayes this morning on Sky and repeated what Scott Morrison has been saying – higher taxes are not on the Coalition’s agenda. So everything is on the table, except that. But in the way things go in Australian politics, we are, of course, talking about ideas which had been dismissed, by one side of politics or the other, for no other reason than a different side of politics once suggested it or tried to enact it. One being, a carbon price. Which Labor is in support of. As are the unions. As are the main business lobby groups. But which the Coalition was very much not in support of. But that could be changing, because it is popping up quite a bit lately, and that is actually a good thing, because maybe, just maybe, there could be a grown up discussion on the issue. Anthony Albanese was also asked about that this morning: One of the things that has happened over recent times of course is that the cost of energy, the cheapest form, is new renewables. What it needs is a government that is prepared to provide certainty in terms of the energy market and providing a policy framework that will drive that investment. We’ve seen investment in 2019 fall off the cliff for renewables but we also need to look at the way that renewables and clean energy can drive advance manufacturing, can add to our industrial growth with new industries and new energy sources such as hydrogen as well can play an important role. There has been a lot of talk lately about whether or not the new bipartisanship and openness to ideas we have been seeing over the last six weeks will extend to a post-Covid Australia, at least politically. Part of it will have to – the economy is not going to look anything like it has, and pulling Australia through the next years is not going to be easy. Or pretty. But this is Australian politics, so I don’t think anyone is overly hopeful. Anthony Albanese gave his opinions on that this morning, when speaking to the ABC: I would hope that some of the government’s rhetorical changes last beyond the current crisis. They’ve acknowledged that unions play a constructive role in society rather than their previous concentration on attacking the rights of working people and the trade union movement. They have acknowledged that we need to listen to the science and I hope that that translates into other issues beyond medical science, into environmental science, into listening to what the scientists are telling us about the need to act on climate change, and they have acknowledged there is a role for government in providing support for the private sector to operate. We certainly will need a strengthening of the private sector coming out of this crisis but we will also need to acknowledge the vital role the government plays, the contracting out, for example, of Centrelink services meant that we weren’t in a position to actually look after people when it was needed during this crisis. Peter Dutton spoke to the Nine network this morning and said banks that did not pass on bridging finance to businesses which were struggling to pay their staff should be “publicly shamed”. Australia’s banks have access to some pretty cheap credit at the moment, the idea being that they use those credit lines, which are basically secured by the government, to provide credit lifelines to businesses. Businesses need those credit lines because there was a time gap between when the government’s wage subsidy was announced and when the ATO started paying it out. If you have no one coming in and spending money in your business, you have no way to pay your staff. And round and round it goes. But the banks, which got in massive amounts of trouble in Australia for lending to just about anybody with a pulse and identification not that long ago, are now getting in trouble for not rushing those loans out. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg held a phone hook-up with the banks yesterday. The morning TV and radio shows will tell you it was a FURIOUS phone call, which means the political spinners can give themselves a pat on the back this morning. Morrison and Frydenberg both spoke about the call yesterday and gave a public warning to the banks to start the credit flowing. This morning it was Dutton’s turn: The banks have got a lot of stepping up to do. There’s been a lot of activity already, where you can point to case where is they have provided significant assistance, but it needs to be more widespread. We want people to remain connected with their businesses. We hope that, over the next few weeks, we can start to see the economy take its first steps back to normality, and that will require the banks to be involved, for credit to be extended, wages need to be paid, and businesses need to be paid, and businesses need to be able to put themselves in a position where they can reopen and re-function. It’s just gone NSW press conference o’clock. Gladys Berejiklian says there were seven new cases in the last 24 hours, but added that the state had increased the amount of testing it was doing. Can I again thank all of you and say the New South Wales government is considering what we can do moving forward to ease everybody’s stress that you are going through and part of that strategy is increasing the number of testing, making that more available to everybody across the state but also making all of us aware that if we do consider going forward in the future with lifting restrictions we also have to be prepared to practice social isolation because we know that cases will go up and people will need hospitals. That is why we have bought ourselves good time in New South Wales and in preparing our health system and other institutions for what the next few months might look like. The Victorian parliament sat to pass its coronavirus legislation yesterday. Its emergency bills passed last night. As AAP reports: The government now plans to borrow $24.5 billion to help the state combat the economic carnage from the virus. The mammoth COVID-19 omnibus also includes temporary changes, including the introduction of judge-alone criminal trials, virtual meetings for state and council politicians, WorkCover extensions and a ban on evictions and rent increases, with a sunset clause of six months. As well, the Victorian government has set up a dedicated taskforce to help keep the state’s building and development industry running through the crisis. It has approved four new projects worth more than $1.5 billion. The state government’s omnibus bill passed with the support of the coalition, despite Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien’s concerns it grants unprecedented powers to the justice system. Karen Andrews was given the job of filling Australia’s manufacturing gaps (there are a lot of them, so it is mostly the most crucial, such as medical PPE which has been the focus) as the government turns towards what broken supply chains would mean for an island nation. There is still no talk of subsidies to reanimate the manufacturing sector in Australia. Instead, there is a lot of talk of “identifying the gaps”. As you would know, there is no hope of a long-term manufacturing resurgence, without government assistance. That is an issue for another day – at the moment, Andrews is happy when an Australian company can switch its focus for something the nation needs. The latest? Clets Linen &amp; Co Pty Ltd, which normally specialises in linen and garments for hospitality and other industries, will provide 3,750 disposable isolation gowns to the national medical stockpile in its first production run. Greg Hunt has committed an additional $6m to drug and alcohol addiction support during the pandemic. That includes: · $2m to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation to deliver an information and awareness campaign to make Australians aware of the support that is available, and to develop resources specific to the isolation context. · $1.5m to Turning Point to scale up treatment episodes provided by Counselling Online, and enable better integration of the service with primary care providers. · An additional $1.5m to Hello Sunday Morning’s Daybreak Program. Daybreak is a treatment and early invention mobile app that provides online support to individuals seeking assistance in reducing their alcohol consumption. The service helps Australians reduce risky drinking habits by simultaneously addressing the psychological and relationship issues that can sometimes drive drinking in the first place. · $0.4m to SMART Recovery to support adaptation of their service delivery model to an online format. · $0.6m to the Matilda Centre to support enhancements to Cracks in the Ice and Positive Choices portals, to target Australians impacted by isolation. Cracks in the ice provides information about crystal methamphetamine for community organisations. Positive Choices is an online portal to help school communities access accurate up-to-date drug education resources and prevention programs. In addition, the National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Australia will deliver a Covid-19 Alcohol and Pregnancy campaign addressing increased alcohol consumption leading to unplanned alcohol-exposed pregnancies during the pandemic. The campaign will be implemented largely via social media and target women impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, particularly social isolation and quarantine. The national cabinet will meet today as part of its normal schedule. Australia has just finished the first week of the four-week suppression phase, which I guess would be better described as a holding pattern, so we don’t expect any big changes or announcements from this meeting. Queensland will move to have its changes to funeral restrictions – from 10 people to 20 – given the OK by the national cabinet. Scott Morrison will continue to push for schools to be reopen, although that doesn’t look like happening much beyond the fifth or sixth week of term, as the states give parents time to get used to the idea. Basically, everyone is in agreement that if the infection rates stay this low, restrictions can be lifted. But with nations like Singapore, which suppressed the virus only to see a surge when restrictions were lifted, as an example, the national cabinet is taking a softly, softly approach to how it will relax the physical distance rules. The woman speaking here, Sophie, would not be alone. And that is despite Australia’s rates being quite low. As AAP reports: A final-year medical student has been thrown out of her Brisbane share house because a housemate feared she would infect him with coronavirus. The student, identified only as Sophie, has told the ABC she was told to get out because she was on a placement at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s hospital. She said one of her housemates had become convinced that she would become infected with the virus and pass it on to him. The student said she picked up on her flatmate’s anxiety and all four housemates sat down to chat about minimising risks, how they’d support each other if any one of them got sick, and how they’d isolate in a shared environment. “I thought the conversation went reasonably well,” she said. “The next morning I received a message asking me to leave. He said he was sorry things had to be this way, but he was uncomfortable with the risk of me being a medical student and attending placement.” Sophie has since moved in with a friend but says her experience becoming suddenly homeless due to her job in health isn’t rare. “I have friends, personally, who’ve been asked to leave then their landlord has retracted that when it’s become apparent societally that it’s not acceptable,” she said. “Others have elected to move house to try and isolate themselves from their families if they’re working in a high-risk area, and really struggling to find somewhere to live.” She urged people to consider more than themselves during the coronavirus crisis. “I think we run into trouble when people only consider pandemics and coronavirus in terms of what’s the risk of you giving it to me.” The Ruby Princess has left Port Kembla and the nation is preparing for a very low-key Anzac Day. Other than that, it’s situation stay suppressed as Australia ends another week with a flatter curve. Anzac ceremonies will go virtual this year. Most RSLs have arranged for veterans to pay homage how they can and to ensure there is community support for those who want or need it. Ceremonies will be broadcast for those at home. Winston Peters, the deputy New Zealand prime minister, has been talking about reopening the trans-Tasman borders when possible as a sort of trans-Tasman “bubble” for some time. Yesterday Scott Morrison said it was New Zealand that Australia was looking to “reconnect” with as soon as possible. The leaders of both nations have been speaking every week, as usual, with both optimistic their countries can manage to suppress – or in NZ’s case, almost eliminate – Covid-19 from their populations ahead of a vaccine. Which means Australia is heading into the “sentinel” testing phase – testing people to ensure that the virus hasn’t spread to more of the community than anticipated. NSW is now opening testing to anyone with symptoms, not just those in the cluster areas. One in 70 people in Victoria are being tested as that state ramps up its procedures as well. We’ll cover all of the day as it happens. Thank you again for joining us. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day.

In Groningen, in the Netherlands, almost two-thirds of trips are made by bike, making it one of the most cycle-friendly cities in the world. It’s no accident that the Dutch city also has great air quality. The UK manages a meagre 2% cycling rate overall. And we all know about the air quality here. If, by the way, your wheels are redundant, please pass them on to the Bike Project to match with someone who desperately wants one. But actually you don’t need your own bike to clear the air. Public bike-share schemes – now fixtures across the world – are key to moving away from cars. But they’ve got to be good. The danger is that if there are no bikes in docking stations when you turn up and your commute is thwarted, you’ll revert to being a car driver – and an embittered one. Fears like this explain why three huge China- based firms ready to flood UK cities with bikes have been given a lukewarm reception. When China’s Ofo, the “Uber for bikes”, wheeled into Cambridge recently, it sparked fears that, in the absence of a carefully regulated docking station system, mountains of bikes would be abandoned in chaos. It’s early days, but we need more than bikes. Sorry to harp on about the Netherlands again, but with 22,000 miles of cycle paths, that’s what you call a cycling culture. It wasn’t always thus. In the late 1960s, Dutch towns were as car-centric as everyone else. The 1973 oil crisis, combined with fears about the danger to children from traffic, convinced a few planners to stand up to the car. Soon after, citizens woke up to find new one-way systems that meant there was no point trying to cross town in a car. That’s what you call tough love. The big picture: the future is green Is this the UK’s greenest building? Newly opened at Nottingham University, this science complex contains state of the art labs and reaches two prestigious sustainability standards, BREEAM Outstanding and LEED Platinum. There’s a carbon-neutral lab powered by solar energy and biofuel, and any excess heat is used by the rest of the campus. We hope emerging scientists are inspired by their surroundings. Well dressed: inside Gujerat’s textile powerhouse Gujarat, India’s most westerly state, is a textiles powerhouse. Giant textile factories in the single city of Surat produce 30m metres of man-made fibre every day (most tights will come from here). But the “power” is provided by workers (near to one million in this state alone) who toil in conditions described by filmmaker Rahul Jain as “extreme wretchedness”. Jain, whose maternal grandfather owned a textiles factory, was drawn to capture the dehumanising supply chain of the fashion industry. “The factory smelled like a vat of ammonia,” the director has said. Ammonia is used heavily in the manufacture of man-made fibres and in the processing of conventional cotton. In Machines, Jain’s wonderfully stylised and visually stunning film, you can almost smell it.

But these days that coal is shipped from a mine that is no longer digging. It is burned at a power plant that is about to be demolished. Port Augusta is the fabled canary in the coalmine – a coal town teetering on a precipice as it transitions away from fossil fuels. One possible future is the town creating hundreds of jobs by building Australia’s first major solar thermal power plant, sucking up the energy of the sun and providing a steady stream of power for southern Australia. On the other side of the precipice is decline, with the free market left to the decide the fate of the people who live in Port Augusta. Many factors seem to line up to favour the brighter path: local councillors, residents and anti-coal activists are campaigning for it; there is a state grant that seems almost designed for it; and possible federal interest from Malcolm Turnbull and his new clean energy fund. A US company with experience building solar thermal plants is enthusiastic about a thermal power plant, plus coal power workers and their union are on board with the idea. As the jostling, lobbying and campaigning carries on, towns around Australia and the world are looking on, hoping Port Augusta can do it. It would give hope to communities facing a similar future as the world starts to leave fossil fuels in the ground. But despite all the apparent support,both futures appear perfectly possible. And that’s terrifying for people in Port Augusta and others looking on. Coal jobs doomed “The closure of Alinta’s coal operations in the area are frankly devastating,” says Joseph Scales, secretary of the Australian Services Union, which represents most of the workers at the Northern power station, set to be shut down in May this year. When it closes, almost 200 people will lose their jobs. Some might be redeployed in the public sector – a deal that was made when the power plant was privatised – but the majority will find themselves with a redundancy package and slim job prospects in the area. Scales says the plant is the most significant employer in the region, helping to prop up the wider economy. When it goes, he says, if well-paid and secure jobs aren’t created in the region, it will have big ramifications for Port Augusta and the surrounding towns. It’s about more than just this region, Scales says. As coalmines and coal-fired power plants close around the country, he sees Port Augusta as a kind of test case for how Australia will handle the transition. Power stations and coalmines in Victoria’s Latrobe valley are set to shut down in coming years, and what will happens to the people working in those jobs is far from clear. “We ought to have been planning for what we call a ‘just transition’,” he says. Scales says the Australian Services Union acknowledges that the world needs to move away from coal and is calling for a plan that will allow those workers to be retrained and redeployed to assist with the transition. Reinventing fossil fuels jobs “I’ll be 55 this year,” says Gary Rowbottom, a technical officer at the Northern power station. “So I’ll need to really try and get another job for the next 10 years or so.” Rowbottom says while he hopes things work out well for the town, and it becomes a model for how towns can leave fossil fuels behind, in some ways it is already a lesson in what not to do. Things have been left too late, and already workers are looking for new jobs and leaving the area. “We’re a bad example because there’s a sudden cut off and then the possibility of solar thermal. We were hoping to have new things built before the closure so we could have an increase in jobs, not a big gap.” In 2012, Alinta’s other power station in the area – the Playford B power station – was shut. Then in November last year, the Alinta’s Leigh Creek coalmine, 250km to the north, which supplied the brown coal for the stations, ceased mining. (The coal was stockpiled and is now being shipped by train until it runs out.) And when the Northern power station shuts, that’s it for the coal industry in the region. But it doesn’t have to be it for the thermal power industry, insists a wide coalition of people. In fact, it seems impossible to find someone urging against the building of a solar thermal power plant. Since a solar thermal power station is still a thermal power station, it employs many of the same sorts of people. “Instead of having a coal feed and a boiler on the front end, we have a tall tower that we pump molten salt through and lots and lots of heliostats,” says Daniel Thompson, director of development in Australia at SolarReserve. “We’re kind of different at the front end but very similar on the back-end and the back-end is where the power is generated.” At the “back-end”, that heat is used to turn water into steam, which drives a steam turbine, just like a coal power plant. “So that’s why there is a very similar job arrangement to a conventional coal power station.” SolarReserve has built a 110MW solar thermal plant in the desert in Nevada, with more than 10,000 mirrors concentrating the sun’s heat on to a tower filled with molten salt. It’s building a similar plant now in South Africa and hopes to do something roughly the same in Port Augusta. “In Nevada, our Crescent Dunes project created roughly 4,000 jobs ,” he says. “We had more than 1,000 people on site at one time building it. And we’re creating between 45 and 50 full-time roles for operation and maintenance.” In the long term, that doesn’t fully replace the almost 200 people employed at the coal power plant that is closing, but Thompson says by being a first builder, Port Augusta could win itself the lion’s share of any future solar thermal industry that develops. He says there’s a possibility that the now-defunct car manufacturing industry in South Australia could be retrofitted to produce the mirrors and other components used in solar thermal plants. “One of the things we have lots of is the heliostats,” he says. Heliostats are the mirrors that focus all the sun at the central tower. “In the case of Crescent Dunes we have 10,347 of these. And each of them is 115 square meters. “So we are keen to explore whether it makes sense to locally manufacture them and we’ve been in discussion with some South Australian companies about that.” If the car factories could be retrofitted, that would undoubtedly be a major selling point for South Australia, which is reeling from auto industry closures. But Tom Georgis, senior vice-president of development at SolarReserve, says whether that happens will depend on how confident the market is that there will be more of solar thermal plants to justify investment in infrastructure. “There’s going to be a view taken by certain business sectors about the viability of the technology and the pipeline – how many of these types of projects are going to be built – and then business decisions will be made about whether or not investment will be made to retrofit an automotive fabrication facility to shift it over to producing components for the mirrors. We fully anticipate that is going to happen.” Georgis adds: “One of the key wildcards for us and the industry as a whole is the mining sector.” He thinks one of the biggest markets for the solar thermal plants is to power mines, which are often in remote locations and build their own off-grid power. He says the mining industry is naturally conservative and slow to adopt new technologies. But if it sees it working in Port Augusta, it might start to see it as a good option. “Port Augusta can be the catalyst for the creation of a fairly substantial industry in Australia. Both for grid-connected power supply into the [national electricity market] but also for the mining sector.” Salt, steam, power The type of power plant proposed by SolarReserve is based on its facility in Nevada, where mirrors focus the heat of the sun on to the tower containing molten salt. That salt can store the heat for days, if necessary, with minimal loss. When electricity is needed, the salt is circulated through a system where it produces steam, which drives a turbine. It provides what coal companies have established as the holy grail of power sources: base load power, which means that, like coal, it can provide energy constantly. But since it can be turned on and off when needed (unlike coal) it can also provide energy whenever it’s needed, like gas, in what is called “dispatchable power”. Manuel Blanco, director of the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative at the CSIRO, says that means the plants provide more than the mere total energy they create. By filling in the gaps left by solar and wind, they provide a kind of service to the grid. “They can act as base load. And you can also balance the amount of storage to suit the needs of what you want to do. “Sometimes critics of renewables energy say: ‘Well, wind is fine, but every time you put some capacity in the grid, you need a backup in case the wind is not blowing.’ But in these, they have the backup already there.” Blanco says these benefits of solar thermal are huge, and not properly priced in electricity markets. He chairs a committee called the solar power and chemical energy systems executive, at the International Energy Agency, which examines barriers to implementing solar thermal. A major barrier is that these grid services are not properly recognised or priced, he says. “In some markets there are no market signals to value appropriately this contribution of dispatchability or the storage.” He says there are several examples of incentives that can provide premiums for systems that provide these services. Solar ambitions One way of correcting market failures is with government funding programs. As far as that goes, the stars might be aligning for Port Augusta’s solar ambitions. The South Australian government has said it wants to source all the energy the government uses from renewable sources, and has called for expressions of interest for industry to develop that capacity. SolarReserve says it has submitted a proposal. That could provide the power plant with a customer, but to get it off the ground, it would still need some further support. So far, activists and community groups have been calling for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to fund the facility’s construction with a grant. Over the past month, people from Port Augusta have been meeting with the politicians in Canberra, including with Malcolm Turnbull, urging them to support the project. Lisa Lumsden is a local councillor and member of a campaign group called RePower Port Augusta. Shortly after meeting the prime minister last month she said he seemed genuinely interested in the project. “He said he’d have a word with minister [Greg] Hunt about it,” says Lumsden. “SolarReserve is looking for a commitment from the Arena fund,” she says. “We are hoping that Arena will recommend to minister Hunt that he support the SolarReserve project so that it can get up.” Since SolarReserve is likely seeking more than $50m, Arena would need the minister’s blessing. But then this week Turnbull announced Arena would stop making grants, and instead offer financing and equity arrangements through a new Clean Energy Innovation Fund. At first that seemed like a setback, but then Turnbull specifically highlihgted the Port Augusta solar thermal project as the sort of thing the fund might support. “An example of a project could be a large-scale solar facility with storage in Port Augusta,” he said. As soon as that happened, locals and activists got excited. Repower Port Augusta called a press conference and Lumsden said: “This is a massive step forward for our community with the prime minister signalling the new Clean Energy Innovation Fund could be used to fund solar thermal with storage in Port Augusta.” As the media and renewables industry tries to figure out exactly what the renewables fund will mean, Lumsden is enthusiastic about the way things look. “We have a company willing to build it, the South Australian government wants to buy clean power and now we’ve had our strongest statement of support yet from the federal government. It really feels like we can make solar thermal happen for Port Augusta.” All the while, the trainloads of coal keep depleting the last of the stockpile at Leigh Creek, delivering it to Port Augusta. For another six weeks or so, that will continue, until the last of it is burned and the power station is switched off. Meanwhile, the sun will keep shining on Port Augusta and whether or not that’s used to power its future now seems in the hands of government. “We’re going to bust our guts to make it happen,” says Lumsden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/renewable-energy-cities-solar-wind-rio-delhi-nairobi-london-arup-vestas","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-22T08:03:09Z","webTitle":"What next for renewables in cities? – the expert view","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/renewable-energy-cities-solar-wind-rio-delhi-nairobi-london-arup-vestas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/renewable-energy-cities-solar-wind-rio-delhi-nairobi-london-arup-vestas","fields":{"headline":"What next for renewables in cities? – the expert view","bodyText":"As renewable energy projects are rolled out in cities around the world, we spoke to companies and organisations working in the sector to find out what’s happening and what to expect. Here’s what they said. ‘It’s cheaper than the alternatives’ – Sarah Chapman, CEO, Faro Energy In an increasing number of cities around the world, businesses are switching to rooftop solar. The trend started in rich countries, where solar has been subsidised, but as the cost of solar has come down it has become cost-competitive in sunny cities from Rio de Janeiro to Delhi to Nairobi. Companies with large energy demand and available roof space are making the switch not just because it’s greener but also because it’s cheaper than the alternatives. Where the grid is unreliable, it also reduces reliance on expensive diesel generators. In countries like the US, Germany and the UK, the roll-out of solar has been fuelled by third-party ownership, which means the company doesn’t have to pay for the system upfront and instead pays monthly, as it would its normal electricity bill. This model is now starting to be adopted in some emerging markets and is making solar a viable choice for a much wider range of companies. Faro Energy funds distributed solar projects in Latin America such as one on the roof of the new aquarium in Rio de Janeiro. ‘New opportunities for entrepreneurs’ – Amit Ronen, director, GW Solar Institute A US Department of Energy report (pdf) issued last year analysed the solar energy-generating potential of 128 American cities and concluded that rooftop solar could technically meet 39% of total US electricity demand. However, while technically possible, the majority of Americans are unable to enjoy the benefits of solar ownership because, among other reasons, their rooftops are unsuitable, they are renters, or they can’t afford upfront installation costs. These factors are particularly prevalent in city environments and within lower-income communities, which make up 40% of US households but account for less than 5% of solar installations. An emerging new business model, community solar, promises to break through those barriers by letting consumers buy or lease a portion of an off-site solar array – usually a project of tens or hundreds of kilowatts connected to the consumer’s local distribution grid – or its output with little or no money down and at prices below prevailing electricity rates. Community solar faces a range of legal, regulatory and financial barriers, largely stemming from the attempt to fit this new model into a century-old system designed for utilities operating large centralised facilities. But a number of enterprising businesses are taking up the challenge and the prospects look good. While only 6 MW (paywall) of community solar were installed in 2013, today there are nearly 3 GW of projects in development. That means lots of new opportunities for entrepreneurs and options for urban residents to support renewable energy. GW Solar Institute is a research facility focused on the economic, technical and public policy issues associated with the development and deployment of solar energy. ‘Commercial financing can assist’ – Justin Wimbush, associate director and head of renewables, Arup In parts of the world where cities have a role in the purchase and selling on of electricity, they can require some or all of it to be sourced from local renewable energy generators. However, even with the recent significant reductions in the cost of technologies such as wind and PV, such arrangements may only work if adequate Power Purchase Agreements can be negotiated. Other barriers to the development of renewable installations include matters such as the evolution of local legislation to allow the use of embedded generation – in other words, the generation of energy within the urban environment. Cities with weak or poorly maintained electricity networks are often reluctant to allow electricity to be exported from a building into the city’s electricity distribution grid, or will provide little or no financial return for such electricity, which may significantly reduce the viability of the installation. This is particularly the case where the available renewable resource, such as sunshine, does not occur when energy is required, such as with many residential applications. Where energy storage can be made a part of the solution, this problem can be overcome. Where financial barriers are hindering the development of renewable energy projects, commercial financing can assist. The London Energy Efficiency Fund, for example, funds renewable energy projects as well as energy efficiency projects. Innovative funding models such as the use of pay-as-you-go mobile phone type funding is now being used by some private sector developers to install renewables in previously un-electrified parts of the world, providing the local population with lower cost electricity compared to the alternatives, namely electricity from diesel generators. Arup is an independent firm of designers, planners, engineers, consultants and technical specialists. ‘The main challenge is system stability’ – Morten Dyrholm, group senior vice president, Vestas The main challenge for renewable energy adoption is no longer costs but system stability. How do we ensure that people, businesses and cities have the power they need when they need it? Obviously we need the capacity to fulfil demand, but equally importantly we need markets that can provide the necessary electricity when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining. This means solutions that can help variable generation to interact more fluently with the energy system, such as storing electricity, managing demand and giving stability to the grid. A good example is Denmark, which had a wind penetration rate of more than 40% in 2015. The recipe there includes strong transmission grids and effective and transparent power markets. Combining renewables with other generation technologies that easily can be ramped up and down, and the use of specialised wind-forecasting tools are also key factors. Vestas designs, manufactures, installs and services wind turbines around the world.

Known as “Sprites”, the miniature satellites are just 3.5cm x 3.5cm and carry radios, sensors and computers, with each device powered by sunlight and weighing just four grams. While nanosatellites known as CubeSats have previously been sent into space, such systems have a mass thousands of times that of the Sprites, weighing more than 1kg. Scientists say the latest development is an important a precursor to an ambitious attempt to send space probes to planets beyond our solar system, dubbed Breakthrough Starshot. “This is a new frontier of tiny, gram-scale spacecraft” said Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University, chair of the advisory committee for the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative. The Sprites, Loeb adds, are also cheap. “Each of them is only tens of dollars in cost,” he said. Announced last year by Stephen Hawking and Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, who has put $100m into funding the first five years of the project, Breakthrough Starshot’s goal is to develop chips with a weight of roughly one gram and fit them to a lightweight sail before propelling them through space with a 100-billion watt laser. “The reason one needs to push the weight down is because in order to reach the nearest stars within our lifetime, the spacecraft needs to move at a fraction of the speed of light – a fifth of the speed of light or so,” said Loeb. While Sprites have previously been carried on board the International Space Station, this is the first demonstration that it is possible to launch such a lightweight miniaturised satellite into space and communicate with it. The Sprite project is led by Zac Manchester, now a researcher working with Loeb at Harvard University, who began work on the spacecraft almost a decade ago, before the project became part of the Breakthrough Starshot effort. Two Sprites are currently glued to the outside of the Latvian Venta satellite and the Italian Max Valier satellite, small systems built by the Germany-based company OHB System AG and launched together in June. “I actually ended up flying to Germany with these things in my carry-on,” said Manchester. Four Sprites are also travelling inside the Max Valier satellite and are designed to be released into space – although that plan is up in the air given a technical hitch in communication with the Italian satellite. Michael Garrett, director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, welcomed the success of the Sprites. “I find it quite surprising but exciting as well,” he said, pointing out that the Sprites show such chips are stable in space, can harness solar energy, and are able to communicate. “Normally this is happening with satellites which are the size of a big mini-van, or even bigger than that,” he added The Breakthrough Starshot project relies on the miniaturisation of technology, and plans to use a tiny chip to host a number of instruments, including navigation equipment and a camera. However, the communication system on the device will be laser-based, rather than relying on radio-waves as the Sprites do. “If someone had talked to me two years about sending anything to the nearest star I would have thought that was a bit of a joke to be honest,” said Garrett. “I suppose I had never really grasped the concept that nowadays we can put lots and lots of complexity onto just a computer chip that weighs hardly anything.” The idea is that by sending such tiny spacecraft to planets orbiting nearby stars, it will be possible to collect data which could help to shed light on the possibility of life beyond Earth. The top destination for such a mission is our nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, within which is the star Proxima Centauri which is orbited by the planet Proxima b. Not only is Proxima b thought to be a rocky planet, but it is also within the so-called “habitable zone”, the distance from a star at which liquid water might exist, which has caused much excitement in the search for extraterrestrial life. Martin Rees, astronomer royal and emeritus professor of cosmology and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, described the success of the Sprites as a huge development for miniaturised spacecraft. While Rees believes sending tiny space probes to nearby star systems is “very futuristic”, he says the satellites could open the door to new miniature devices to probe our own planet – and the solar system. “You [could] have very large numbers of tiny probes monitoring Saturn and its moon etc in more detail than we have done up till now, simply because of the advances we are familiar with every day from mobile phones,” he said, pointing out that the technology on board the Cassini spacecraft currently studying the planet is decades old. Loeb believes it will take 20 years for the Breakthrough Starshot space probes to be developed, and another 20 for them to reach the Alpha Centauri system, but he says the wait will be worth it. “You can think of it as the modern incarnation of building the pyramids,” he said. “My personal hope is that once we have a spacecraft leaving the solar system we get a message back saying ‘welcome to the interstellar club’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"20 of the best campsites in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","fields":{"headline":"20 of the best campsites in Europe","bodyText":"Le Clos du Lac, Provence, France Setting Mountains Pitches 50 Activities Fishing, swimming Perched at 1,485 metres on the edge of Écrins national park, this mountain site offers Instagrammable views from the tent door and a range of picture-perfect outdoor experiences.

The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed. You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before. These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond. Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points. Dirft and the Magna Parks are within what, with unexpected romance, is called the “golden triangle”, a land of sheds, roads and marketing gerunds (such as Eddie Stobart’s “delivering sustainable distribution”) laid over the fields and towns of old England. In some accounts the triangle’s points are Leicester, Coventry and Milton Keynes and in others its sides are the M1, M6 and M42 motorways, but in either case it describes an area from where 85% of the population of Great Britain can be reached in four and a half hours, which is the maximum time an HGV driver can travel without taking a break. In other words, if you order a set of John Lewis bathroom towels in Southampton, Cardiff or Manchester, it will come from the same big box in Milton Keynes. The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now divided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords. The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way. Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn. You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality. The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway. Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.” But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters. There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky. It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well; if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour. Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time. The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place. Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape. Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good staff. Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day. Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users. It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English; “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank, giving almost no clue of their busy inner lives. Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions? For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic. Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume that the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between what was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become more stark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jan/31/tesla-battery-farm-california-energy-elon-musk","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-31T19:18:50Z","webTitle":"Tesla moves beyond electric cars with new California battery farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/31/tesla-battery-farm-california-energy-elon-musk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/31/tesla-battery-farm-california-energy-elon-musk","fields":{"headline":"Tesla moves beyond electric cars with new California battery farm","bodyText":"From the road, the close to 400 white industrial boxes packed into 1.5 acres of barren land in Ontario, California, a little more than 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, look like standard electrical equipment. They’re surrounded by a metal fence, stand on concrete pads and sit under long electrical lines. But take a closer look and you’ll notice the bright red coloring and gray logo of electric car company Tesla on the sides. And inside the boxes are thousands of battery cells – the same ones that are used in Tesla’s electric cars – made by the company in its massive $5bn Tesla Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. This spot, located at the Mira Loma substation of Southern California Edison, hosts the biggest battery farm Tesla has built for a power company. Southern California Edison will use the battery farm, which has been operating since December and is one of the biggest in the world, to store energy and meet spikes in demand – like on hot summer afternoons when buildings start to crank up the air conditioning. Tesla’s project has a capacity of 20 megawatts and is designed to discharge 80-megawatt hours of electricity in four-hour periods. It contains enough batteries to run about 1,000 Tesla cars, and the equivalent energy to supply power to 15,000 homes for four hours. The company declined to disclose the project’s cost. The project marks an important point in Tesla’s strategy to expand beyond the electric car business. Developing battery packs is a core expertise for the company, which is designing packs for homes, businesses and utilities. It markets them partly as a way to store solar electricity for use after sundown, a pitch that works well for states with a booming solar energy market such as California. Battery systems built for power companies can serve more than one purpose. A utility can avoid blackouts by charging them up when its natural gas power plants, or solar and wind farms, produce more electricity than needed, and draw from them when the power plants aren’t able to keep up with demand. Edison and other California utilities hired Tesla and a few other battery farm builders after an important natural gas reservoir near Los Angeles, called Aliso Canyon, closed following a huge leak and massive environmental disaster in late 2015. The leak forced thousands of people in nearby neighborhoods to evacuate. It also left utilities worried about how they’d meet the peak electricity demands of coming summers if they weren’t able to dip into the natural gas storage whenever they need fuel to produce power. They couldn’t always get natural gas shipment from other suppliers quick enough to meet a sharp rise in electricity consumption. As a result, the California Public Utilities Commission approved 100 megawatts of energy storage projects for both Southern California Edison and also San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. The commission also asked for the projects to be built quickly, before the end of 2016. Other energy storage projects that have been built since include a 37.5-megawatt project in San Diego County by AES Energy Storage, which used lithium-ion batteries from Samsung. AES has completed the project, which is going through the commissioning phase. AES also plans to build a 100-megawatt project for Southern California Edison in Long Beach in 2020. Even before the Aliso Canyon disaster, the commission had already recognized the benefit of using energy storage to manage supply and demand and expected it to become an important component in the state’s plan to replace fossil fuel energy with renewables. The commission, which requires the state’s three big utilities to add more wind and solar energy to their supplies over time, also set a statement energy storage target of 1,325 megawatts by 2020. Surrounded by rows of batteries at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the project on Monday, Southern California Edison’s CEO Kevin Payne said the Tesla project is important because “it validates that energy storage can be part of the energy mix now” and is “a great reminder of how fast technology is changing the electric power industry”. This latest crop of energy storage projects use a new generation of lithium-ion batteries. Historically, batteries were too expensive for energy storage, but their prices have dropped dramatically in recent years, thanks to their mass production by companies such as Panasonic, Tesla and Samsung. Companies that buy lithium-ion batteries have been reporting drops in prices of 70% over the past two years. Tesla has said it plans to lower its battery prices by 30% by expanding production inside its Gigafactory. At the event on Monday, Tesla’s co-founder and chief technology officer JB Straubel said: “Storage has been missing on the grid since it was invented.” Tesla is counting on the energy storage market as an important source of revenue and built its giant factory with that in mind. The company believes its expertise in engineering and building electric cars sets itself apart from other battery farm developers. Tesla has been developing battery packs for a decade and improved the technology that manages the batteries temperatures, which can be high enough to pose a fire risk. Overheating is a well known problem for lithium-ion batteries, which require insulating materials and software to keep them running cool. A battery farm built next to a wind farm in Hawaii by a now-bankrupt company caught fire in 2012 and temporarily put a dampener on the energy storage market. Tesla has been building another battery farm on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and has projects in Connecticut, North Carolina, New Zealand and the UK. The company is looking for opportunities to build battery farms outside of California, including the East Coast and countries such as Germany, Australia and Japan. Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk has said in the past that the company’s energy storage business could one day be bigger than its car business."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T19:25:29Z","webTitle":"Charlottesville's white awakening: 'We were living in a bubble,' say residents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis","fields":{"headline":"Charlottesville's white awakening: 'We were living in a bubble,' say residents","bodyText":"Inside the University of Virginia’s Scott Stadium, a succession of pop stars were telling local residents that “Love trumps hate” and “You will not dethrone love.” Dave Matthews, Pharrell Williams, Ariana Grande and Justin Timberlake were holding a free concert to help Charlottesville recover from the violent white supremacist and neo-Nazi protests that rocked the town last month. But as he smoked a cigarette by the stadium concession stands Sunday evening, Jack (who did not want his last name used) wasn’t talking about love. He was talking about his vote. The 25-year-old, who has lived in Charlottesville most of his life, is a conservative in a liberal town. He said he had voted for Donald Trump, hoping that a political outsider would bring change. Then white supremacists had marched across his hometown carrying torches and chanting “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.” They carried guns and wore helmets and shields and fought with anti-fascists in the streets, generating news footage viewed around the world. As a white man, the kind of American these far-right groups claimed to represent, “I felt ashamed,” he said. His friends who are not white had been terrified, wondering if they would be safe going outside or walking around. In response, Trump, the president he had supported, repeatedly blamed “both sides” and “many sides” and said there were “very fine people” who marched alongside the neo-Nazis. Jack said he didn’t know if any mainstream conservatives had marched alongside neo-Nazis on 12 August. “If I saw a Nazi flag go up, I would be out of there,” he said. Charlottesville was definitely not the first time Trump had said something that made Jack uncomfortable, and it was was not the first time friends had shared their fears with him about how their race might make them vulnerable. When it came to police brutality, Jack said, he listened, but he also had his own relationship with the police as authority figures, and wanted to believe that most police officers would not simply racially profile people. “This was different,” he said. The white supremacists’ attitude towards other races was absolutely clear. Whether Trump was a white supremacist himself, he said, he did not know. But together with Trump’s “Rocket Man” jabs at North Korea, the president’s reaction to Charlottesville had convinced him that he would not be voting for Trump again, and that he needed to vet his candidates more carefully in the future. On Sunday, as tens of thousands of locals filled stadium seats and clustered on the field in front of the stage, the mood was relaxed and upbeat. But, like Jack, some white Charlottesville residents said that that watching fascists march through their streets had been a wake-up call. “It opened our eyes,” said Pat Sury, who lives outside Charlottesville. “That it’s here as well as everywhere else. We were living in a bubble.” “I think it got everybody talking a lot more about what’s going on in our community,” said Rosanna Lavin, 62, sitting with Sury and other friends at a small tailgating party in the parking lot. “We cannot be blind to some of the issues that we really don’t deal with,” including “alt-right hatred” and “race relations”. At work, Lavin said, she has tried to talk about race more with her colleagues of color. “I think we’re too afraid to approach subjects sometimes and get honest reactions,” she said. But the “bits and pieces” of conversation had not yet produced steps forward other than overall support. Conversations about racism “are not the funnest conversations to have or the easiest,” but they were happening with more urgency now, said Devin Welch, 33, who works for a solar energy company in Charlottesville, at a different tailgate party. Before the white supremacist protests, local entrepreneurs had already been discussing how to support and fund a more diverse set of start-up founders, ensuring that venture capital funding did not just stay within white social networks. After the protests, it’s not just a priority – “now it’s top,” he said. Welch said he believed that what Charlottesville had witnessed was the “death gasps of a dying ideology,” not the growth of something new. Malcolm Wills, 20, and Fernando Garay, 19, said that protests in Charlottesville had appeared to make people more comfortable openly saying racist things, particularly on Facebook. Both young men said they had been shocked to watch acquaintances defend white supremacists online, and that people they knew talked earnestly about their concerns about white people becoming a minority. The tension and anxiety of the first days after the white supremacists’ protests had faded, Wills said. The two young men said they hoped that if the neo-Nazis came back, the town would choose to let them protest without much reaction, rather than feeding their agenda with attention. A black fourth-year student at the University of Virginia, who said she did not want to give her name, said she was trying to enjoy her last year of university, and not let what happened define her experience. That wasn’t easy. As a peer counselor to younger students of color, she said she has fielded many questions from first-years about whether they should transfer to another school. She said she advised them to stay. “Sadly, wherever you are in America, you can probably experience these things,” she said. Inside the stadium, Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, the young woman killed when an alleged white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, had received a standing ovation from the audience at the beginning of the concert, and urged listeners to continue her daughter’s legacy by showing up to confront hatred and discrimination. “Tragically, because Heather stood bravely against racism and hatred, she was taken from us,” Bro told the crowd, asking them to “turn our righteous anger into action.” Her daughter “loved humanity with an open heart. That’s what gave her the strength and compassion to stand up with her friends against hate. As Heather said, if you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.” Ariana Grande, whose young fans were targeted by a suicide bomber in Manchester in May, leaving 22 people killed and dozens more wounded, struck a similar note between her sets at the concert. The pop singer, who just finished a world tour, came to Charlottesville to participate in her second benefit concert following an act of terror in the space of just four months. She had hosted her own benefit, One Love Manchester, in June. America’s president usually serves as the country’s consoler-in-chief. But Trump, who had branded terrorists “evil losers” after the Manchester attack, had not come to Charlottesville to offer support. So it was the 24-year-old pop singer who took on that rhetorical role, mixing consolation with a reminder of their shared values. “I want to tell you how proud I am to be part of a generation that is so passionate about making a change,” she told the crowd. “Keep using your voices and making this a safer place for each other.” This article was amended on 26 September 2017 to remove the full name and photograph of an interviewee at their request."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/06/state-schools-face-solar-tax-hike-but-private-schools-exempted","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-06T15:18:40Z","webTitle":"State schools face solar tax hike - but private schools exempted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/state-schools-face-solar-tax-hike-but-private-schools-exempted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/06/state-schools-face-solar-tax-hike-but-private-schools-exempted","fields":{"headline":"State schools face solar tax hike - but private schools exempted","bodyText":"Many state schools with solar panels are set to be hit with a tax hike, according to government plans, but private schools, free schools and academies will not be affected due to their charitable status. Campaigners say the move will end the installation of solar energy for most schools. The government proposes to end an exemption for small solar panel installations (less than 50 kilowatts) and charge business rates on them from April 2017. The charity 10:10 has calculated this will cost schools more than £820 a year for the average 10kW installation and, combined with recent cuts to the subsidy paid for rooftop solar energy, make future projects risky or uneconomic. As recently as September 2015, schools could expect to pay back the costs of installation in five to eight years, but the new regime would mean payback times of at least 12 years and perhaps never, 10:10 says. The changes to subsidies, which are estimated to have cost 12,000 jobs nationwide, have already forced 10:10 to close its Solar Schools programme, which had installed more than 2,000 panels on 80 schools since 2011, working with more than 30,000 pupils. “This new tax hike is just nonsensical,” said Cecily Spelling, at 10:10. “It’s punishing those that have already installed solar and discouraging more in the future. It’s about so much more than just generating energy - it brings communities together and gets people excited about the positive things they can do to tackle climate change. “It’s also a brilliant resource for science, technology and maths education. It’s so sad that only a very few, select schools will be able to experience this kind of solar-powered magic in the future. It is just so unjust.” Research conducted for Nesta and Solar Schools found participants felt more engaged in taking action on climate change, with more than 70% changing their behaviour to save energy. Adam Stanley, assistant headteacher at Liss primary school in Hampshire, said: “The prime reason [for installing solar panels] was the attraction of a clean sustainable form of energy, which sent out a very clear message that we were serious about looking after the environment.” He said the subsidy cuts have already discouraged other schools from following suit. “The news that the government now intends to increase business rates fills me with despair. Not only will we struggle to break even on our investment, but by the exemption of schools with charitable status you are creating a two tier system which penalises local authority schools. I urge [ministers] to rethink this rash decision.” Winchester College is among the private schools which recently installed solar energy, adding 500 panels to its rooftops. Samantha Williams, headteacher of Middleton primary school in Leeds, said: “Installing solar on our roof has been a great thing for the school, the pupils and the community. The changes to the feed-in tariff were bad enough but the new business rates being thrown into the mix too will stop schools in their tracks and punish those around the country who have already done the right thing and installed.” The proposed change in business rates will also affect many solar installations on commercial buildings larger than the 50kW exemption, hiking up charges by six to eight times, according to the Solar Trade Association (STA). The STA says there are already 23,000 non-domestic rooftop installations that would be affected and is calling on the government to make all self-owned rooftop solar panels exempt from business rates. A government spokesperson said: “Solar deployment is a UK success story with almost 11GW of capacity now installed, and the government is committed to providing secure, clean and affordable energy now and in the future.” He said: “Business rates are based on valuations from the independent Valuation Office Agency. We will look closely at the impacts of the forthcoming valuation, and consult on how to put the right support in place for businesses to adjust to any changes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jun/28/solar-power-energy-us-utilities-environment-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-28T16:29:31Z","webTitle":"Here comes the sun: US solar power market hits all-time high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/28/solar-power-energy-us-utilities-environment-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/28/solar-power-energy-us-utilities-environment-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Here comes the sun: US solar power market hits all-time high","bodyText":"Solar energy in the US has had a rocky existence. Ever since Ronald Reagan symbolically removed Jimmy Carter’s solar panels from the White House roof in 1986, federal policy has been unpredictable, such that manufacturers and consumers could never depend on reliable incentives to produce and install solar energy systems. Remarkably, the US solar energy industry is now entering what may be its most prosperous decade ever, thanks to a new wave of federal and state policies and positive economics in the industry, both at home and abroad. “I think it will actually be bigger than people are projecting,” says Jigar Shah, president and co-founder of Generate Capital, a clean energy investment firm based in San Francisco. “The solar industry is booming right now.” The US solar industry expects to install 14.5 gigawatts of solar power in 2016, a 94% increase over the record 7.5 gigawatts last year, according to a new market report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. Revenues from solar installations also increased 21% from 2014 to more than $22bn in 2015. For the first time, more solar systems came online than natural gas power plants – the top source of electricity in the US – in 2015, as measured in megawatts, said Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association. This year, new solar is expected to surpass installations of all other sources, said the US Energy Information Administration. The rise of solar energy use, especially by homes and businesses with panels on their roofs, is gradually transforming the electricity industry. For more than a century, power plant owners and utilities have controlled the energy delivery service, and some of them enjoy a monopoly. “We were just a tiny little speck 10 years ago, and now we are really up there with the major established generating technologies,” said Baca. “It’s amazing.” Sunny path What’s behind all this? A federal tax credit has played a key role: it enables home and business owners to take off 30% of the price of their solar energy systems from their income taxes. Congress renewed the tax credit last December. Another factor is cost. It is simply a lot cheaper to install solar these days, largely because cost of components have declined considerably. The wholesale price of a solar panel today is about $0.65 per watt, compared with $0.74 per watt a year ago and $4 per watt in 2008. The steep decline in prices began initially in Germany. In 2000, Germany adopted policies that heavily subsidized solar power by adding a special charge on consumer utility bills. Utilities use the money collected from that special charge to pay higher rates for solar energy as part of a government policy to promote renewable energy. The higher rates created a huge demand for solar panels, driving manufacturers to compete for those dollars and other countries to institute similar policies. Until last year, it was the largest solar energy producing country in the world. “They created a massive demand for solar, and manufacturers around the world started stepping up to that,” Baca said. “Prior to that, a lot of solar panels were still largely made by hand. But the scale that manufacturers started growing to allowed a little bit more automation.” Then China, where labor costs were lower, rose to become a mighty manufacturing force. Chinese manufacturers built massive factories to make solar panels, drove down the prices for solar panels and forced more than a hundred of its competitors in Europe, US and even within China to go bankrupt. The fallout hurt so many businesses that the US government imposed tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels after determining that Chinese manufacturers were pricing their products at below fair-market values. The tariffs and increasing domestic demand have boosted manufacturing jobs in the US, which is now one of the top five nations for solar panel producers behind China, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. “Now the market’s so large you can actually sustain the large manufacturing plants and support the product locally,” said Shah. One example is SolarCity, which is building a giant new solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York. The facility, expected to be in operation later this year, plans to employ 3,500 people. It will produce panels primarily for SolarCity’s own projects around the world. Declines in other sources of electricity generation has also helped solar’s growing popularity. The coal business suffered historic losses in 2015 as concern about its greenhouse gas emissions took hold. Just 3 megawatts of new coal generation came online in 2015, compared to about 2,600 megawatts for solar, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Dark clouds ahead? Although the solar market is booming overall, its reliance on government incentives makes it vulnerable to the whims of policymakers. In Nevada, once considered a role model for solar development and a national leader for solar jobs per capita, the state Public Utilities Commission approved a major rollback of solar subsidies and policies last December. The commission voted in response to a complaint by the state’s largest utility, NV Energy, which contended that the subsidy – and the billing process required for the program – threatened its profitability. That change prompted SolarCity, one of America’s largest solar companies, to stop selling and installing new systems in Nevada and take some 550 jobs with it. Another company, Sunrun, did the same. As a result, the industry association expects Nevada to drop from the fifth-largest state for residential solar installations in 2015 to 31st by the end of this year. Robert Boehm, director of the Center for Energy Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said the changes could mean trouble ahead for the industry as a whole. “My opinion is that many of the utilities in the US would like to do this in general,” Boehm said of curtailing state solar incentives and policies. “The whole rooftop solar thing has really gone south (in Nevada). We were amongst one of better states in terms of supporting rooftop solar. Now we are down amongst probably the worst.” Energy storage presents another obstacle. Solar remains a small contributor to the nation’s energy supply, accounting for less than 1% percent of total electricity production. As it grows and replaces traditional sources of energy, which can produce electricity any time, the need to make solar energy available even when the sun isn’t shining will only grow. Batteries are emerging to be the solution, but the technology and the manufacturing scale aren’t improving quick enough to make it financially feasible for the masses. One company, Tesla Motors, is attempting to address that problem by building a massive factory in Nevada to build lithium-ion batteries that will go into energy storage packs designed by Tesla for homes and businesses. Tesla is counting on battery sales to complement its electric car business. Its CEO, Elon Musk, surprised investors last week when he announced Tesla’s plan to buy SolarCity. Musk is the chairman of SolarCity’s board of directors. Boehm, who has solar panels on the roof of his home, said cheaper batteries will nudge more people to invest in solar equipment. “I’m kind of an enthusiast, but I wouldn’t do it right now,” Boehm said. “I don’t think the costs are right. We’re seeing the price of batteries come down and they’re improving the performance of them too. The movement’s in the right direction.” Shah takes a different view. Consumers shouldn’t have to worry about energy storage because they can always count on the utilities if their own solar panels aren’t producing energy, he said. Utilities, on the other hand, should invest in more renewable energy and storage to meet the growing demand and ensure a stable flow of electricity. “The amount of capital and investment going into to solar is at an all-time high,” Shah said. “I think the economics are clearly very good and we haven’t really even tapped but a very small percentage of our opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jul/13/could-a-blockchain-based-electricity-network-change-the-energy-market","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-12T23:24:53Z","webTitle":"Could a blockchain-based electricity network change the energy market?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/13/could-a-blockchain-based-electricity-network-change-the-energy-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/13/could-a-blockchain-based-electricity-network-change-the-energy-market","fields":{"headline":"Could a blockchain-based electricity network change the energy market?","bodyText":"The blockchain. It is the much-hyped, virtually foolproof digital ledger that allows cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to flourish without the need for banks and governments, and promises to enable everything from the creation of ethical supply chains, to the ensuring of instantaneous payment on delivery of goods and services agreed to in immutable smart contracts. The techno-utopian predictions for this system ignore one crucial detail, however. The intense data processing required by blockchain pulls in an extraordinary amount of electricity, and widespread use of it would drag global energy markets into the abyss – and bring the world’s carbon emissions budget down with it. As an example, just a single bitcoin transaction has been calculated to devour as much energy as what powers 1.57 US households for a day – roughly 5,000 times more energy-hungry than a typical credit card payment. Would you prefer to pay by cash, credit or planet-wide blackout? The electricity sector will need to dramatically increase capacity and lower emissions to pave the way for the era of smart contracts – and interestingly enough, a number of industry players think blockchain itself could provide the answers. They range from the big, such as the 10 major utility companies joining the Energy Web Foundation’s efforts to identify and roll out blockchain energy solutions, to the small, such as US startup LO3 Energy’s launch of a blockchain-enabled green energy microgrid in Brooklyn later this year. Similar to LO3 Energy’s offering is that of Australian company Power Ledger, which has developed a peer-to-peer energy trading model that works around utilities companies using blockchain in much the same way that bitcoin traders dance past the banks. Power Ledger’s managing director, David Martin, explains that households that generate excess rooftop solar have to sell it to the grid operator at a greatly reduced price. “Imagine you’re growing a whole lot of tomatoes, but you can’t trade them over the fence with the neighbour for their zucchinis – you’ve got to go to the supermarket to sell to them and buy from them,” he says. “That’s the situation in energy markets now – we want to change that.” What his company is trialling is a system that will enable people to hawk off their rooftop solar energy directly to other households at a higher price than they would get by selling to a utility company. By making rooftop solar even more economical and maximising use of the power it generates, Martin hopes blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer energy trading will help lower carbon emissions while raising energy capacity. His company completed a virtual trial in Western Australia in January, and has taken the lessons learned from that and applied them to a real-world trial in Auckland, New Zealand. That began in December and will gradually ramp up to a network of 500 customers live-trading green energy. But isn’t the blockchain process that underpins the whole system gobbling up most the power? Not so, says Martin. He claims the energy-consumption issue has been averted by adopting a vastly more efficient form of blockchain than that which is used by bitcoin. Whereas most blockchain relies on proof-of-work processes, Power Ledger employs something called proof-of-stake. The former consumes vast amounts of energy as it involves solving ever-more complicated mathematical equations, but proof-of-stake blockchains are based on pseudo-random chance. “It uses the fraction of energy of conventional blockchain. Proof-of-stake is ideally suited for energy,” Martin says. One of the leading critics of blockchain’s energy-consumption backs the approach. Michel Berne, the director of economics studies at Telecom management school in Paris, has been highly critical of the carbon footprint of blockchain, but he thinks, for energy markets at least, proof-of-stake could be a solution. “Yes, I believe that proof-of-stake blockchain applications can validly compete with other non-blockchain based solutions in energy trading,” he says. “Peer-to-peer energy trading is nascent, notoriously difficult to manage and blockchain solutions might be useful.” He questions whether proof-of-stake could completely phase out proof-of-work blockchain in other sectors however, as he is unconvinced it offers the same level of security that is the point of blockchain in the first place. Energy-efficiency isn’t the only obstacle in the path of a blockchain-based electricity network. Dutch peer-to-peer energy trading network PowerPeers runs its system using already-available infrastructure and smart meter data. Co-founder Michiel Ooms says the company is looking for ways to integrate blockchain, but has encountered several roadblocks. “The biggest challenge we see so far is the handling of privacy-sensitive data,” he says. “Using the blockchain brings more transparency, including on data exchanged. And although our whole vision is about making the energy market more transparent, sharing privacy-sensitive data (such as consumptions, locations, financial transactions) probably would not comply with the GDPR regulations that come into effect in the EU in 2018. Legislators therefore also have quite a bit of work to do if they want to enable everyone to participate in the future energy landscape.” In Australia, Power Ledger also predicts legislative changes will be needed to pave the way for blockchain, or any kind of peer-to-peer energy trading for that matter. “The system was designed at a time when regulators didn’t contemplate distribution and storage, let alone customers trading among themselves – everything is set up for a system of generating power a long way away from a centralised source,” Martin says. “Reform is needed to the requirement that consumers who have excess PV being required to sell to a retailer – we need to change the market so it understands consumers aren’t just consumers anymore – they are generators too.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/aug/13/sun-rain-room-review-tonkin-liu-home-for-all-seasons","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-13T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sun Rain Room review – a home for all seasons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/13/sun-rain-room-review-tonkin-liu-home-for-all-seasons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/13/sun-rain-room-review-tonkin-liu-home-for-all-seasons","fields":{"headline":"Sun Rain Room review – a home for all seasons","bodyText":"When it starts raining on the slate roof of the Grade II-listed, late Georgian north London house where the architects Anna Liu and Mike Tonkin have their home and office, it gathers in a black downpipe on the rear wall. This is normal. What happens next is not. Before it gets to the bottom, like a stunt plane exiting a death dive, the pipe turns, curves and then swoops into a more shallow descent, then goes up a bit, then down again, before terminating in a non-figurative gargoyle about two metres off the ground, from which the rainwater, after a delay while it gathers enough pressure to push itself through the elaborate pipage, then gushes. Which turns out to be only one move of several in an architectural rain dance. The gargoyle discharges into a long black steel trough that, if a switch is flicked, then overflows via concealed pipework in such a way that water starts rising through the joints between dark granite paving in a small courtyard. Should it be night-time, horizontal lasers can be switched on, which capture drops with illumination as they fall and bounce. If it’s day and the sun comes out, rippling light will reflect off the wet paviours, bouncing around surrounding surfaces of glass, mirror and whiteness. All this irrigation and solar energy eventually manifests itself as vigorous vegetation, a touch exotic and tropical, some of it growing out of the planted roof that partially encircles the court. The Sun Rain Room, as this work is accurately called, may be the architectural project with the most meteorology per square metre since Noah built the ark. The architects say they want it to be “a good place to be on a bad day”. Because of the doubling and dissolving of the reflective surfaces, it takes a while to realise how little usable space is actually added – just a big wall cupboard to house a barbecue, a potting shed and such like, an enclosed area big enough for a smallish dining table and another, sheltered but external, where you can also eat. Mostly, it’s a machine for enjoying the weather. There is also a room underneath, the bedroom of a basement flat, added late in the gestation of the project when it became clear that the mathematics of property prices in the London borough of Islington would more than repay the cost of construction. It is thus a (relatively modest) addition to the new basementism that elsewhere in the capital has seen swimming pools and vintage car collections put underground. But here the main object of the work – which has taken 12 years to complete since it was a gleam in Tonkin and Liu’s eye, and whose cost of £235,000 would be much greater if they hadn’t put a lot of their own time and ingenuity into the construction – is to allow the full enjoyment of a small London garden that somehow they hadn’t used much. Its style, superficially, is a sort of retro-futurism, the 21st century as seen from the 1960s and 70s, a bit Kubrick, a bit Woody Allen in Sleeper, white and swooshy, engaging but hard now to look at without the condescending thought that the future didn’t turn out quite like this. Tonkin Liu, who made their name with a series of singular private homes and makeovers of public spaces, are fond of this style, though they’re fluid enough not to be a one-look practice. There is a bit of it in a bridge they have proposed for Salford, and the interiors of a clifftop house in Dover. The Sun Rain Room is also more than this. Tonkin refers to his early years working for an architectural reclamation company in Bath, where he “learned so much about classical detailing”. While there is absolutely nothing neo-Georgian about their design, he says, it has picked up cues from the house it extends, taking, for example, twists and curves from the old stairs and banisters. The architects also say they’re re-enacting on a smaller scale the interaction between hard architecture and lush planting that you get in the composition of the town square their house faces, with a big garden in the middle. The curving ceiling around the edge of the courtyard is punctured by small, glass-domed holes that admit discs of light, like little suns. The holes are at the end of inverted lunar craters whose curved concentric contours are then picked out in fine relief. The repeating curved lines consciously echo the waves of reflection that play across them. They modulate light and shadow in a way somewhat like the subtle recessions and projections of Georgian glazing bars and panelling. The old house itself is mostly painted white, with mirrors inset at opportune moments – behind shelves, in cupboard doors – such that they dematerialise the walls and fold views of external greenery and weather into the interior. They help to set up a continuum of light, reflection and dissolving surfaces that, while it’s clear where the old stops and the new starts, runs from the square garden through the house to the back of the Sun Rain Room. It has required patience and effort to achieve – negotiating the legalities of small London sites with many neighbours, waiting for financial stars to align, managing the construction themselves to keep costs down, working with sympathetic subcontractors. Two leading engineers have made possible the project’s structurally ambitious ideas. One, Tim Macfarlane, assisted with an all-glass staircase that maximises the light reaching the basement and glows at night with light coming from below. Another, Rodrigues Associates, has helped achieve the exceptionally thin profile of the curving roof. Its plywood structure was assembled with the help of students from three London architecture schools. In the end, the hard construction and hard work serve intangibles and subtle substances such as light, atmosphere and nature, things that, as Tonkin and Liu say, “don’t cost anything”. A world is constructed of dissolution, floating, evanescence and inversion in which opposites combine. There are plants on the roof and water on the floor. The stairs are glass. It’s techno-natural and futuro-Georgian. With so many ideas in a small place it could all be too much. With so many devices and contraptions, there’s a risk they might not function as well as advertised. But one of the impressive things about the Sun Rain Room is the degree of thought given to things like proportion, lines of sight and the shade of materials to put behind water, such that its drops and ripples become visible. It works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jul/26/california-communities-lawsuit-exxon-shell-climate-change-carbon-majors-sea-level-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-26T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Exxon, Shell and other carbon producers sued for sea level rises  in California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/26/california-communities-lawsuit-exxon-shell-climate-change-carbon-majors-sea-level-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/26/california-communities-lawsuit-exxon-shell-climate-change-carbon-majors-sea-level-rises","fields":{"headline":"Exxon, Shell and other carbon producers sued for sea level rises in California","bodyText":"Three Californian communities have launched legal action against some of the world’s biggest oil, gas and coal companies, seeking compensation for the current and future costs of adapting to sea level rises linked to climate change. San Mateo and Marin Counties, coastal communities in northern California, and Imperial Beach, a city in San Diego County, have filed complaints against 37 “carbon majors”, including Shell, Chevron, Statoil, Exxon and Total. They claim greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuel companies’ activities over the last 50 years have locked in substantial sea level rises, which will cause billions of dollars’ worth of damage to properties and businesses, as well as endangering lives. According to the complaint, the defendants “have known for nearly 50 years years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on the Earth’s climate and sea levels”. Rather than working to reduce impacts, the complaint claims the companies engaged in a “co-ordinated, multi-front effort to conceal and deny their knowledge of these threats”. A spokeswoman for Shell said “we believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.” A spokesman for Statoil said this lawsuit was not the first against the industry and that “previous cases have been dismissed as [providing energy while meeting climate commitments] is a political, not a judicial, issue”. Exxon and Chevron declined to comment specifically on the litigation. BP and Total did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Climate change litigation “This an unprecedented moment for climate change litigation,” says Sophie Marjanac of campaigning lawyers Client Earth, which is monitoring the case. Coastal California is already experiencing the effects of rising sea levels, says Deborah Halberstadt, executive director of the state’s Ocean Protection Council which recently released a study (pdf) about the threat of rising seas. “The rate of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could rapidly accelerate, leading to extreme sea-level rise, [...] with potentially catastrophic impacts for California,” she says. Serge Dedina, the mayor of Imperial Beach, a low income coastal community in San Diego County, says that up to 30% of the city could be affected by climate change. “As the lowest-income, highest poverty-rate city in San Diego County, we have no capacity to pay for the extensive adaptation measures.” It’s a similar story for Marin County. Within 15 years, says county supervisor Kate Sears, flooding could affect tens of thousands of residents and cause upwards of $15.5bn (£11.9bn) in property damage. “This lawsuit is intended to shift those costs back where they belong – on the fossil fuel companies,” she says. “We are at the point of no return in fighting climate change,” says San Mateo supervisor Dave Pine, “and if we don’t reduce emissions there will be catastrophic impacts.” Potential property damage in the county is estimated to be in the region of $39bn, with sea level rises set to affect more than 100,000 residents (pdf). This isn’t the first time fossil fuel companies have found themselves facing legal action over climate change. Kivalina – an Alaskan barrier island community of fewer than 400 people – filed a lawsuit in 2008 against oil companies including BP and Chevron demanding up to $400m for relocating their village in the face of rising sea levels. They were ultimately unsuccessful, with their case dismissed on the basis that it was a political question, not one for the courts. “This claim has a better chance,” says Marjanac, “we have better climate science now.” She also believes the “vacuum in the US at a federal level” when it comes to climate change, may make the state court more willing to step in. She does, however, acknowledge there are significant hurdles to success. These include the “utility argument”: that companies are providing energy to the world, something that is demanded and sanctioned. Pressure heating up on carbon majors While all parties acknowledge the claim is likely to be prolonged, awareness raising is an important element. “This kind of litigation is a vital tool in the spreading effort to force oil companies to change their business models,” says Jeremy Leggett, founder of solar energy company Solarcentury. Exxon, Total, Shell and Statoil are among those already making some shifts away from fossil fuels. Shell’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, announced earlier this month that the company would invest up to $1bn per year in its New Energies division to explore alternative energy. But the energy transition will be “change that will take place over generations”, he said, not a revolution. Exxon told the Guardian “oil and natural gas will remain prominent in meeting global energy”, but a spokesman said the firm is working on alternatives and “invests about $1bn a year to support a broad portfolio of R&amp;D projects ranging from advanced biofuels to carbon capture.” Total has made significant investments including the purchase last year of battery company Saft for $1bn. And Statoil has established Statoil Energy Ventures with $200m in investment capital for four to seven years. However, many campaigners and analysts remain sceptical. “These investments amount to lip service,” says Kelly Mitchell, climate and energy director for Greenpeace USA, “while [fossil fuel companies] dump resources into more fossil fuel projects around the world, lobby politicians and lock us into decades of fossil-fuel infrastructure.” Leggett sees varying levels of seriousness among the big players. “No company has admitted the game is up yet. Some have taken out substantial hedged bets in the form of significant investments in clean energy, notably Total and Statoil. Others have dug in, seemingly for a fight to the death,” he says. “The bottom line,” says Mitchell, “is that these companies are clinging to an outdated business model that is not compatible with a safe climate and liveable communities.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/09/powershop-reveals-cash-for-renewable-projects-from-customers-who-paid-more","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T19:01:07Z","webTitle":"Powershop reveals cash for renewable projects from customers who paid more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/09/powershop-reveals-cash-for-renewable-projects-from-customers-who-paid-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/09/powershop-reveals-cash-for-renewable-projects-from-customers-who-paid-more","fields":{"headline":"Powershop reveals cash for renewable projects from customers who paid more","bodyText":"Amid fresh attacks on renewable energy targets from the federal government and large energy retailer ERM Power, smaller electricity retailer Powershop has raised $100,000 from its customers to be given out as grants to 10 community-owned projects around the country. Three months ago Powershop launched the Your Community Energy initiative, where they gave customers the opportunity to pay higher rates, which it said would then be distributed to renewable energy projects that were community-owned. Powershop aimed to raise $20,000 by the end of 2016 but, as of February 2017, it had raised $100,000. One project – rooftop solar on the Centre for Education and Research in Environmental Strategies (Ceres) centre in Melbourne – has already received $10,000 from the initiative and used that to complete their 15 KW solar installation. A spokeswoman for Ceres, Judy Glick, said the installation would save the community group $2,000 each year and reduce their yearly emissions by almost 16 tonnes of CO2. “Ceres is on a mission to achieve zero emissions by 2025,” she said. Five other projects were also announced as recipients of a share of the money. They include a micro hydro station in Daylesford, Victoria, which is being organised by Hepburn Wind, the operators of the first community-owned windfarm in Australia. Also receiving funding is the Milparinka Centre (Victoria), Castlemaine Childcare Centre (Victoria), Moyola Lodge (Victoria), Mid Mountains Neighbourhood Centre (NSW) and Buckets Way Neighbourhood Centre (NSW). Powershop’s chief executive, Ed McManus, said he expected to raise $500,000 within 12 months and wanted to accelerate the growth of community-owned renewable energy. “The way energy is generated, how it travels to our homes and how we pay for it, is going to change dramatically in our lifetime,” McManus said. McManus aacknowledged the initiative was partly about “brand-positioning” for Powershop. But he said the company began as a 100% renewable energy generation company and then only became a retailer when it partnered with a community-owned windfarm. He said that meant the initiative was a natural move for the people behind Powershop. McManus said Powershop would need to hear from community energy projects in order to find recipients for the money they expect to raise in the coming months. The Victorian minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the fact customers had chosen to pay more for their electricity to fund community renewable energy showed people were behind renewable energy and wanted to support it. “We should be encouraging all providers to find more ways for them to do so,” she said. Powershop also recently launched a program called the Your Neighbourhood Solar Powerpack, where customers in Victoria could buy solar energy directly from their neighbours, allowing those with rooftop solar to get a higher feed-in tariff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"North West Cambridge: a model for affordable urban housing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","fields":{"headline":"North West Cambridge: a model for affordable urban housing?","bodyText":"At the centre of debates about green belts is the question of trust. In theory it should be possible to build on a very small proportion of the nation’s green belts in such a way that affordable housing and sustainable communities are created, and more people have more and better access to nature than before. In practice few people trust that this will happen, as the available evidence is that we will get instead a smearing of developers’ standard products across the countryside, for sale at inflated prices. The promise of what’s called the North West Cambridge Development is that it will indeed achieve these good things. Here the University of Cambridge is turning 150 hectares of what was flat, inaccessible and somewhat featureless farmland, located between the city and the M11, into a billion-pound urban district the area of which is not much smaller than the historic centre of Cambridge itself. Three thousand homes are planned, half of them affordable, plus 2,000 postgraduate student bed spaces, 100,000 sq m of research facilities, and the schools, shops, surgeries and the like needed to sustain them. Two new public parks are being created, one between the new development and the old city, the other a series of lakes and mounds that buffer the sights and sounds of the motorway. The development is motivated by the extreme effects of growth in Cambridge, resulting in house values that have priced out key workers, including researchers and young academics, without which neither university nor city can function. In this way Cambridge acutely experiences pressures felt in other parts of the country, which has put it at the forefront of finding ways to do something about them. Change doesn’t happen quickly: discussions of expansion have been going on since the 1980s, with the current plans in development for over a decade. There is a patent desire to be responsible and exemplary in everything. The North West Cambridge Development sets out to achieve high levels of sustainability, including many photovoltaic cells to gather solar energy, low levels of car use and the recycling of rainwater for irrigation and the flushing of toilets. It has been masterminded by the multinational AECOM, which is one of the largest engineering and design consultancies in the world, with landscapes by Townshend, who have worked on large commercial developments such as King’s Cross in London. An array of well-respected architects have been brought in to design individual buildings: the Stirling prize winners Alison Brooks, Witherford Watson Mann, Wilkinson Eyre and Stanton Williams; Marks Barfield of London Eye fame, the Dutch practice Mecanoo and Muma, best known for their makeover of the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. I am told that they also wanted “young” architects, although these practices are almost entirely led by over-50s. The plan is now taking physical form and, so far, it is doing what it said it would. The first homes have been completed in Eddington, which is the name given to the first phase. Residents have started moving in. A “market square” is complete. A new Sainsbury’s opened last week. A primary school has been open for two years. Swirles Court, housing for the graduate students of Girton College, is also complete. Unusually, in comparison with most commercial developments, it is the affordable housing and the shared facilities, rather then the more profitable high-value homes, that are being built first. Cambridge has never been a throbbing metropolis and its suburbs less so. By the time you get to the environs of north-west Cambridge the city is petering out into detached and semi-detached houses. Yet Eddington is in the form of apartment blocks, three to five storeys high, in density more like an inner suburb of a large Victorian city, with the intention of building a lot of homes without using up too much space. It’s a surprising typology, but it makes sense. The architectural style is bricky, rectangular, austere with a few outbreaks of playfulness. Ludwig Wittgenstein, who spent his last months in nearby Storey’s Way, once praised the plain Georgian terraces of Dublin for having “the good taste to know that they had nothing very important to say”, and the same might be said of this style. Metropolitan types call it the “new London vernacular”, but it turns out it’s at home here too, on the edge of the fens. Its best qualities are its thoughtfulness – the unusually high ceilings in ground-floor flats, the proportions of windows, the use of galleries with expansive views to give access to upper-level flats. The more public buildings loosen up a bit, though not too much. The school, by Marks Barfield, is an elegant flat doughnut with a calm, protected space in the centre. Muma’s nearly complete nursery school and community centre, designed for things like “dance classes or zumba, Brownies or film clubs, fashion shows, weddings or fairs”, will offer a lively inner world of contrasting volumes, while still being quite quiet on the outside. So the overall effect is of a development that is thoughtful and considered but also, even after making due allowance for its unfinished state and the fact that plants need to grow, overdoing its sobriety. Here the landscaping, which should be crucial, is unfortunately the weakest part. It should soften and animate and make places distinctive and sociable. What’s there, all good quality to be sure, has its moments – there’s a nice grassy swale running through the development that’s part of the rainwater system – but it tends towards the generic. The market square (where, for now, no actual markets are planned) is a could-be-anywhere bit of tasteful corporate design, for which some funky benches are not a sufficient antidote. There’s a long straight pedestrian-friendly street that looks promising as a place to congregate, but its hard and rectangular planters are oddly discouraging. The beige Mondrians of paving too often beat the planting. You can’t yet see spaces in which it would be a positive delight for children to play. More fundamentally the distribution of design intelligence is out of whack. In a way that almost always happens in projects of this scale the big efficient companies like AECOM are asked to make the really big decisions, whereas the Stirling prize winners and “young” architects get to play with a fairly limited range of choices about proportion and disposition. If the imagination and skills of the latter had been applied to the orchestration of a potentially rich array of shared spaces, and to an overall idea of the kind of place that is being created, it would have turned North West Cambridge from a good to a world-beating piece of planning. But these weaknesses should not detract from what is likely to be a fundamental success of the development. To the basic question to be asked when building on green belt or any green land – is it better than it would have been had it stayed as fields? – the answer is yes. More people will enjoy richer forms of nature in the new parks than in the past, and many will find homes at high levels of design and sustainability. The clout, wealth and wisdom of the university has been vital in achieving this, but if the model can be followed in other green locations across the country we might find a way to create large numbers of decent homes and respect nature at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/01/trump-paris-climate-deal-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-01T20:28:18Z","webTitle":"Trump just passed on the best deal the planet has ever seen | David Suzuki","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/01/trump-paris-climate-deal-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/01/trump-paris-climate-deal-planet","fields":{"headline":"Trump just passed on the best deal the planet has ever seen","bodyText":"Since day one as a contender for the Oval Office, current US President Donald Trump has pushed a dominant narrative: he’s a businessman. He gets economics. He knows the art of the deal. This week, with his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, the president has given the world strong reason to reject that narrative. His rationale – that it’s a choice of economy over environment, and a fossil fuel economy is the top priority – is outdated and false. States and nations around the world have harvested the fruits of clean energy, and are redefining their economies and energy sources accordingly. Yet under false pretenses that “clean coal”, natural gas and other fossil fuel fixes are better than energy conservation and clean energy, the US forges its own, lonely path. The idea that clean, renewable energy will generate power for our planet for generations to come is not rhetoric. The extent of human-caused climate change – and the rapidly improving economics driving the proliferation of renewable energy sources – make it fact. If the US administration isn’t ready to move forward, hundreds of individual states and other countries will. California is already a world leader on climate policy. Texas is rapidly expanding its wind energy capacity. In Germany, clean energy has become a movement itself, focused on thousands of small-scale projects under the Energiewende program. In Scotland, wind generation has increased by 81% over the past year, and in March this year, it produced enough energy to satisfy 136 % of the country’s household energy needs. These are just a few examples. The US’s withdrawal doesn’t mean Americans and US investors will sit still, either. There is substantial economic opportunity in renewables. The US solar industry alone creates one in 50 new jobs. Worldwide, nearly 10 million people already work in renewable energy. Global clean technology exports doubled between 2008 and 2015, surpassing $1.15tn per year. Even America’s corporate giants – from Apple and Google to Walmart, and even oil giant Exxon Mobil – support the Paris agreement. The economics are clear. So what about the political implications of the decision? By withdrawing from this historical agreement, Trump will make more enemies than friends. Polling results from Yale University’s Climate Change in the American Mind survey (conducted after the US election) show that 73% of Trump voters want the US to use more renewable energy. (His own supporters!) As recently as May 7, a small but increasingly vocal group of Republicans has embraced the reality of global warming, taking steps to press the issue in Congress. Elsewhere in the world, 195 countries and the European Union have signed the Paris Agreement, 147 of which have ratified it. Only Nicaragua and Syria have not signed on. When news of the potential withdrawal reached the United Nations, the organization’s Twitter page read: “Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” A Globe and Mail report showed that even fossil fuel companies – the likes of ExxonMobil, BP and Shell – think the US should stick with Paris. This withdrawal is an ugly decision, made by a country that ought to be leading the transition to a cleaner future – not only because of its stature as an international economic powerhouse, but also because of its less-than-desirable environmental track record. After China, the US is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter. In response, China has been become a leading producer of solar energy technology and is slowing its coal power construction. The US, meanwhile, hangs on to a coal industry that should have been dissolved decades ago. Just north of the border in Canada, where I live, the situation is delicate. We have been plagued by recent missteps such as approval of fossil-fuel-driven pipeline projects, but at least our governments claim a commitment to a sustainable, clean energy future. In my home province of British Columbia, recent election results may even reverse the approval of some of those infrastructure projects. But we’re far from safe ground. These types of actions by the US administration show that environmental rights – for Canada and all countries around the world – are vital, now more than ever. Yet, while 110 countries worldwide have environmental rights written into their constitutions, Canada does not. I tend to focus my advice on domestic matters like these. But today, I offer a word to the US president: A global shift to renewable energy is on. There’s no denying it or turning it around. It’s good for business. This is not fake news. It’s real life. And it’s happening with or without you. You claim you know a good deal when you see one. Well, you just passed on one of the best our planet has ever seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jun/29/apple-patagonia-solar-panel-sell-electricity-profit","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-29T19:38:40Z","webTitle":"What do Apple and Patagonia have in common?

Maybe that you are part of a significant shift in the economics of solar. Patagonia and a small circle of US companies are making a foray into the electricity delivery service industry, which has traditionally been controlled by utilities and power plant owners. Most businesses that put solar panels on their roofs in order to show support for a cleaner source of electricity, cut carbon emissions and perhaps even lower their energy bills. But these new entrants are treating solar energy as a profit maker, and their investments will help to expand its use in the broader energy market. Patagonia, the outdoor clothing retailer, announced in March a $35m partnership to install solar panels on more than 1,500 homes in the US. Long known for its focus on environmental issues and having solar panels at its headquarters in southern California, Patagonia will own the solar energy systems. It has contracted with California-based Sungevity to install and manage the panels and handle customer service. Most of the solar energy generated by the Patagonia systems will power the participating homes. The company and Sungevity earn a small profit on that as well as on the sale of any surplus energy sent to the grid. “As a company, it very much aligns with the DNA of what we do, and that’s [to] use business to inspire and influence environmental solutions,” says Phil Graves, director of corporate development at Patagonia. “We’re very passionate about moving away from fossil fuels and finite resources in every aspect of our supply chain.” The new venture isn’t the company’s first investment in solar. In 2014, Patagonia set up a $27m fund to install solar on 1,000 rooftops in Hawaii, which depends on imported petroleum fuels to run its electricity-generating plants. The company saw the project as an opportunity to help swing the state toward a carbon-free alternative. Graves declined to reveal Patagonia’s earnings on solar so far, except to say it has been “good” for the company. “Let’s just call it a double-digit return,” he says. Patagonia isn’t alone in branching out from its core business. The company that started the trend is Google, which received a federal license to sell energy in 2010. The company has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars in solar energy ventures, from rooftop projects to massive power plants within the US and in Germany and South Africa, as part of a plan to use more renewable energy and profit from these investments. Apple seems to share the same interest. Earlier this month, the company applied for a federal license to sell any excess electricity from the solar panels that will grace the roofs of its future headquarters and other existing buildings around the country. In recent years, Apple has been building giant solar power plants near its data centers and offices in North Carolina, Nevada and California. Electricity from these projects will flow into local electric grids and offset the fossil fuel-generated electricity Apple draws from the same grids. The falling cost of solar and implementation of government incentives have made it attractive as an alternative – and cleaner – source of electricity to businesses. Walmart, Costco, Kohl’s, Ikea and Macy’s are the top solar customers as measured by the megawatts installed, according to GTM Research. The Top 20 list also includes manufacturers such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Motors and publisher McGraw-Hill. GTM Research predicts the megawatts of commercial solar will grow 30% this year and nearly triple by 2020, reaching $3.8bn. Lining up business customers takes more time and energy than residential customers, however. The solar market that serves commercial customers has been flat in recent years, partly because every commercial project starts with a blank sheet of paper: customers each have unique power demands and installation issues, and expect their own contractual terms, says Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association. In residential, on the other hand, every customer signs the same contract and usually gets very similar equipment. That simpler process makes the residential market more appealing to companies that are interested in earning a profit from solar. But the industry is filled with competitors, from big players such as SolarCity and Sunrun to local roofers and contractors who have experience installing electrical equipment. Patagonia’s entry brings new money to the space and helps to promote solar energy use among homeowners. “If they found a way to do small deals economically, that would be interesting because it could greatly increase the available capital pool,” Baca says. Patagonia’s interest in solar began with a personal connection. The company’s CEO, Rose Marcario, is a friend of Timothy Ball, the co-founder and former chairman of Mainstream Energy, a solar company in California. Ball urged Marcario to consider investing in the clean energy. A generous federal tax credit certainly helps to nudge the clothing company – and other businesses – to consider solar as a financially viable option. The tax law allows Patagonia to own the energy systems and claim 30% of their costs as an income tax credit. In effect, the rules permit Patagonia to spend some of its federal taxes on solar energy systems. Patagonia has more plans. One idea is to install mini solar power plants to serve up energy to nearby communities, where residents can buy a stake in those projects or sign a long-term contract to pay for solar electricity. Such larger-scale projects, called community solar, are a fairly new and growing area for the industry. They require millions of dollars in capital, and the permitting hurdles can be daunting for most companies. But according to GTM Research, community solar is expected to grow fivefold this year, a result of more states enacting legislation to permit such projects. It may be another area where Patagonia encourages other environmentally minded firms to paddle along in its wake. Graves has had several conversations with chief financial officers at other companies to walk them through the solar deal-making process. Some are beginning to line up their own partnerships. “It’s too preliminary to name names,” he says. “But several of them are companies you’ve heard of.” San Diego homeowner Gene Loucks is one of the first customers under the new Patagonia-funded program. His new solar panels went live earlier this month, and he expects them to help him save $150 per month on his power bill. Loucks doesn’t own the system, so he’s paying only for the electricity. That works out just fine because it also means he doesn’t have to maintain it. “It seems like a good deal for everybody,” says Loucks, 57, who works in law enforcement. “We’re in southern California, and there’s sun all year round here, so it’s really silly for somebody in San Diego to not take advantage of it. It’s just good for the planet.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"cities/2017/mar/18/real-estate-revolution-unstoppable-building-boom-china","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-18T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Put us on the map, please: China's smaller cities go wild for starchitecture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/18/real-estate-revolution-unstoppable-building-boom-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/mar/18/real-estate-revolution-unstoppable-building-boom-china","fields":{"headline":"Put us on the map, please: China's smaller cities go wild for starchitecture","bodyText":"From egg-shaped concert halls to skyscrapers reminiscent of big pairs of pants, China’s top cities are famously full of curious monuments to architectural ambition. But as land prices in the main metropolises have shot into the stratosphere, developers have been scrambling to buy up plots in the country’s second and third-tier cities, spawning a new generation of delirious plans in the provinces. President Xi Jinping may have issued a directive last year outlawing “oversized, xenocentric, weird” buildings, but many of these schemes were already well under way; his diktat has proved to be no obstacle to mayoral hubris yet. From Harbin “City of Music” to Dezhou “Solar Valley”, provincial capitals are branding themselves as themed enclaves of culture and industry to attract inward investment, and commissioning scores of bold buildings to match. Even where there is no demand, city bureaucrats are relentlessly selling off land for development, hawking plots as the primary form of income – accounting for 80% of municipal revenues in some cases. In the last two months alone, 50 Chinese cities received a total of 453bn yuan (£54bn) from land auctions , a 73% increase on last year, and it’s the provincial capitals that are leading the way. At the same time, Xi’s national culture drive has seen countless museums, concert halls and opera houses spring up across the country, often used as sweeteners for land deals, conceived as the jewels at the centre of glistening mixed-used visions (that sometimes never arrive). “Culture,” said Xi, “is the prerequisite of the great renaissance of the Chinese people,” but it has also proved to be a powerful lubricant for ever more real estate speculation – even if the production of content to fill these great halls can’t quite keep up with the insatiable building boom. From mountain-shaped apartment blocks to cavernous libraries, here’s a glimpse of what’s emerging in the regions. Fake Hills, Beihai Forming an 800 metre-long cliff-face along the coast of the southern port city of Beihai, the Fake Hills housing block is the work of Ma Yansong, China’s homegrown conjuror of sinuous, globular forms – whose practice is appropriately named MAD. Having studied at Yale and worked with Zaha Hadid in London, where he nourished his penchant for blobs, Ma has spent the last decade dreaming up improbable mountain-shaped megastructures across the country. As it rises and falls, the undulating roofline of Fake Hills forms terraces for badminton and tennis courts, as well as a garden and swimming pool. Sadly the overall effect is less scenic mountain range than a lumpen collision of colossal cruise-liners. Greenland Tower, Chengdu A crystalline spire rising 468 metres above the 18 million-strong metropolis of Chengdu, the Greenland Tower will be the tallest building in southwestern China, standing as a sharply chiselled monument to the country’s (and by some counts the world’s) largest property developer, Greenland Holdings. It is designed by Chicago-based Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill, architects of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, who say the faceted shaft is a reference to the “unique ice mountain topography” of the region. It harks back to the crystalline dreams of early 20th-century German architect Bruno Taut, who imagined a dazzling glass “city crown” to celebrate socialism and agriculture; whether Sichuan’s farmers will be welcomed into the penthouse sky garden remains to be seen. Sun-Moon mansion, Dezhou Once known as a centre of braised chicken production, the city of Dezhou in the north-eastern province of Shandong now brands itself as “Solar Valley”, a renewable energy centre intended to rival California’s Silicon Valley. At its heart is the Sun-Moon mansion, a vast fan-shaped office building powered by an arc of solar panels on its roof. It is the brainchild of Huang Ming, aka China’s “sun king”, an oil industry engineer turned solar energy tycoon who heads the Himin Solar Energy Group, the world’s biggest producer of solar water heaters – as well as purveyor of sun-warmed toilet seats and solar-powered Tibetan prayer wheels. Harbin Opera House Nicknamed the St Petersburg of the east, the far northern city of Harbin has long had a thriving cultural scene as a gateway to Russia and beyond. In the 1920s, fashions from Paris and Moscow arrived here before they reached Shanghai, and it was home to the country’s first symphony orchestra, made up of mostly Russian musicians. Declared “city of music” in 2010, Harbin has recently pumped millions into a gleaming new concert hall by Arata Isozaki, a gargantuan neo-classical conservatory and an 80,000 sq metre whipped meringue of an opera house by MAD. Shaped like a pair of snowy dunes, up which visitors can climb on snaking paths, the building contains a sinuous timber-lined auditorium designed as an eroded block of wood. Tianjin Binhai library Due to open this summer in the sprawling port city of Tianjin, this space-age library by Dutch architects MVRDV is imagined as a gaping cave of books, carved out from within an oblong glass block. The shelves form a terraced landscape of seating, wrapping around a giant mirrored sphere auditorium that nestles in the middle of the space like a pearl in an oyster. Along with a new theatre, congress centre and a science and technology museum by Bernard Tschumi, the building forms part of a new cultural quarter for the city, itself being swallowed into the planned Beijing-Tianjin mega-region – population 130 million, that’s more than Japan. Huaguoyuan Towers, Guiyang Nowhere in China is the disparity between economic reality and architectural ambition more stark than in Guiyang, capital of rural Guizhou, the poorest province in the country, which has the fifth most skyscraper plans of any Chinese city. The twin 335-metre towers of the Huaguoyuan development, by Arup, are now almost complete, standing as the centrepiece of a new mixed-use office, retail and entertainment complex, while SOM is busy conjuring the even higher Cultural Plaza Tower, a 521-metre glass spear that will soar above a new riverfront world of shopping malls and theatres. It has the glitz and gloss of any other Chinese city’s new central business district, but as Knight Frank’s David Ji points out: “It will be hard for a city like Guiyang to find quality tenants to fill the space.” Yubei agricultural park, Chongqing Architectural funster Will Alsop may finally have found his calling in the supercharged furnace of China’s second-tier cities’ booming leisure economy, crafting a number of fantastical dreamworlds from his new satellite studio in Chongqing – where he is busy building a new cultural quarter around his own office, with a restaurant, bar and distillery. He is also plotting an enormous agricultural leisure park in Yubei, 20 miles north of the city, designed to cater to the new middle classes’ nascent appreciation of the countryside, a place hitherto associated with peasants and poverty. The rolling landscape will be dotted with cocoon-like treehouses, a flower-shaped hotel and a big lake covered by an LED-screen canopy, so visitors can enjoy projected blue skies despite the smog. Zendai Himalayas centre, Nanjing Erupting across six city blocks like a limestone mountain range, the Zendai Himalayas Centre will be Ma’s most literal interpretation yet of his philosophy of fusing architecture and nature. Taking inspiration from the traditional style of “shanshui” landscape brush painting (literally meaning “mountain-water”), the 560,000 sq metre complex is designed to look as if it has been eroded by millennia of wind and water, not thrown up overnight by an army of migrant labourers. Once again, Ma appears to be forgetting that elegant feathery brushstrokes don’t often translate well into lumps of glass and steel. It is one of many such green-fingered schemes in Nanjing, including Stefano Boeri’s “vertical forest” towers and the Sifang art park, where Steven Holl, SANAA, David Adjaye and others have built pavilions in a rolling landscape – as another decoy for a luxury real estate project. Huawei campus, Dongguan Telecoms giant Huawei has courted lawsuits for copying from rivals in the past, but its love of imitating clearly extends to architecture too. The company’s new campus, under construction on a 300-acre site in Dongguan, is based on 12 European towns. There are the dreaming spires of Oxford, the quaint redbrick houses of Bruges, the palazzos of Verona and the chateaux of Burgundy, all connected by a meandering Swiss railway. It might look like a theme park, but the employees will have little time for leisure: Huawei’s founder likens his staff to a pack of hungry wolves and offers them a “dedicated employee agreement” to voluntarily forgo paid holiday and overtime.

Here is what we can expect him to say, who we can expect to be in attendance and who will say what in response. Economy He may or may not be statesmanlike but Trump will definitely be salesmanlike. Working on the premise that the chief business of the American people is business, he will make the case that he, the first businessman president, has brought the economy “roaring” back to life and set the stock market soaring. A tweet last Sunday offered a flavour: “Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!” Anxious to reach beyond his base with an eye on November’s midterm elections, Trump is likely to note that the African American unemployment rate has fallen to a record low of 6.8%. Critics, however, will be quick to counter-claim that whereas 2.06m jobs were created in 2017, about 2.24m jobs were created under Barack Obama in 2016; that Trump’s sweeping tax cut benefits millionaires and big corporations rather than the middle class; and that the administration is carrying out a savage assault on labour rights. Infrastructure In his address to a joint session of Congress on 27 February last year, Trump announced that he would be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1tn investment in infrastructure. “Crumbling infrastructure,” he said, “will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.” But in June, a so-called national infrastructure week was overshadowed by several mishaps and the fired FBI director James Comey’s testimony on Capitol Hill. The plan will feature again heavily in the State of the Union address, but details are not expected to be unveiled until mid-February. Infrastructure is seen as having potential for bipartisan support, but the administration is now planning to spend $200bn over the next 10 years, hoping states, cities and private investors will deliver the lion’s share of $1tn or even $1.7tn. The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, told a Washington Post event on Monday: “The president has always talked about infrastructure, but it’s also, just as with immigration, been a moving kind of target.” Democrats are also worried about Trump slashing environmental regulations to make way for construction. Immigration Trump said on Monday he would address his proposed immigration overhaul in the speech – and it would have to be bipartisan “because the Republicans don’t really have the votes to get it done in any other way”. In the State of the Union he will promote “four pillars” of reform: border security, including the wall; Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) legalisation; ending extended-family “chain migration”; eliminating the visa lottery and moving towards a merit-based system of immigration. Tone and nuance will matter here as the president tries to sell a deal to both Democrats and immigration hardliners in his own party: save the Dreamers but pay the price of a draconian crackdown on immigration, both legal and illegal. The signs so far are that neither side is happy. Meanwhile Trump has called for changes to the H-1B work visa programme widely used to employ foreign tech workers in the US and could return to this issue. National security A senior administration official said: “The president is going to talk about rebuilding our military, returning to a policy of peace through strength, returning to clarity about our friends and our adversaries, and his efforts to defeat terrorists around the world.” Trump is likely to declare total victory over Islamic State and claim that his aggressive stance towards North Korea’s nuclear programme is working: it is unknowable whether he will be tempted to stray into rhetoric such as “Little Rocket Man” to describe Kim Jong-un. American forces in Afghanistan currently number around 14,000 – a 75% increase from the 8,400 there under Barack Obama as of December 2016. The president is expected to ask for $716bn in defence spending, a significant increase, when he unveils his 2019 budget next month, according to the Washington Post. But diplomacy, the state department and human rights are not expected to figure prominently. Trade Trump said on Monday his speech would cover his efforts to lower trade barriers around the world for American exports. “We have to have reciprocal trade,” he told reporters. “It’s not a one-way deal any more.” Within days of moving into the Oval Office, Trump pulled the US out of the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership. He is renegotiating Nafta, a decades-old agreement with Canada and Mexico, as well as a separate, bilateral trade pact with South Korea. Last week the president imposed steep tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar energy cells and panels. Some hardliners in the administration are itching to do likewise to steel and aluminum from China as part of their “America first” agenda. But it is thought that the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have restrained this tendency, appealing to Trump by warning that such a move could hurt his cherished stock market. The address may offer a clue as to whether Trump’s exposure to the global business elites in Davos has softened his approach or at least introduced a note of pragmatism. Any other business Last February Trump urged Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act: it was a long and tortuous process that ended in failure. The burning health issue is opioids, the deadliest drug crisis in American history, killing about 90 people every day. Trump has set up a presidential taskforce and declared a health emergency but not yet unlocked additional funding. The speech’s appeal to patriotism and greatness may well including rumination on Nasa, space exploration and a mooted return to the moon. But a detailed plan for combating climate change seems unlikely from a man who last week told the interviewer Piers Morgan: “There is a cooling and there is a heating, and I mean, look: it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming … That wasn’t working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, OK, they’re at a record level.” Mood music After Trump honoured the widow of a navy Seal killed in Yemen during his address to a joint session of Congress, the political commentator Van Jones memorably declared: “He became president of the United States in that moment, period.” How long will it be on Tuesday night before a pundit uses the word “presidential”? Even if Trump stays on script, as he did last February and last week in Davos, critics say that merely showing the ability to read from a teleprompter is setting the bar too low and risks normalising a dangerous demagogue. For sheer theatre, it will be difficult to top Trump – accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women – being confronted by the sight of many female Democratic members of Congress following the lead of entertainers at this year’s Golden Globe awards by wearing black. Meanwhile, at least eight Democrats are boycotting the event: Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, John Lewis of Georgia, Frederica Wilson of Florida, Gregory Meeks of New York, Maxine Waters of California and Bobby Rush and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. The supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will also be missing. Such is Trump’s caprice that there is always the chance that he will be goaded into an outburst that upends the entire event, or that he will undermine his message with an undisciplined tweet soon after (he followed his congressional address by tweeting the unfounded claim that Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower). Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for George W Bush, told the Associated Press: “He has little message discipline. Virtually every time he moves the ball far down the field, he seems to derail himself with a tweet days later instead of building on the momentum.” Guests The White House says Melania Trump, who has kept a low profile since reports emerged that her husband had an affair with the pornographic actor Stormy Daniels a decade ago, will be in attendance, along with all the president’s children except his 11-year-old son, Barron. The administration has also invited guests including Corey Adams, a welder in Dayton, Ohio who plans to invest his extra savings from the tax overhaul plan into his daughters’ education fund; Elizabeth Alvarado and Robert Mickens, the parents of Nisa Mickens, whose killing in 2016 was attributed to the MS-13 gang; the retired corporal Matthew Bradford, who stepped on a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007 then after surgery re-enlisted in the Marine Corps and became the first blind double amputee to do so; Jon Bridgers, founder of the Cajun Navy, a nonprofit rescue and recovery group that provided aid to people in Texas affected by Hurricane Harvey; and Ryan Holets, a policeman in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who with his wife adopted a baby from parents who had an opioid addiction. Democrats have invited victims of sexual assault and dozens of young immigrants, or “Dreamers”, including an aspiring nurse, Karen Bahena, of San Diego, and a Virginia high school student, Nicolle Uria, who was brought to the US as a one-year-old. Also expected are Randy Bryce, a union iron worker and Democratic challenger to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, in his congressional district in southern Wisconsin (invited by the congressman Mark Pocan); Staff Sgt Patricia King, a transgender infantry soldier (invited by the congressman Joe Kennedy III); Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico and critic of Trump (invited by the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand); Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian-born physician who discovered chronic traumatic encephalopathy in American football players (invited by the congressman Ami Bera); Christine Levinson, the wife of the FBI agent Bob Levinson, who went missing in Iran more than a decade ago (invited by the congressman Ted Deutch); and Bill Nye the Science Guy (invited by congressman Jim Bridenstine, Trump’s nominee to serve as the next administrator of Nasa). Responses Joe Kennedy III, a 37-year-old Massachusetts congressman who is a grandson of former senator and attorney general Robert F Kennedy and great-nephew of John F Kennedy, will deliver the Democratic response from a vocational high school in Fall River, Massachusetts, a former textile hub outside Boston. “From healthcare to economic justice to civil rights, the Democratic agenda stands in powerful contrast to President Trump’s broken promises to American families,” Kennedy said this week. His speech will be followed by a Spanish-language response delivered by Elizabeth Guzman, one of the first Latina women elected to the Virginia house of delegates. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, the congresswoman Maxine Waters of California, and the former Maryland congresswoman Donna Edwards will also offer their takes. Souvenirs Tickets for the address had to be reissued after a misprint: “Address to the Congress on the State of the Uniom.” The congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona made fun of the education secretary, tweeting: “Just received my ticket for the State of the Union. Looks like @BetsyDeVosEd was in charge of spell checking ... #SOTUniom” Any ticket to Trump’s first State of the Union could become a collector’s item. The late-night TV comedian Stephen Colbert said on Monday: “He’s not scheduled to appear in front of Congress again until the impeachment hearings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2017/jun/19/reasons-to-be-cheerful-despite-trump-withdrawing-from-the-paris-agreement","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T09:31:42Z","webTitle":"Reasons to be cheerful, despite Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jun/19/reasons-to-be-cheerful-despite-trump-withdrawing-from-the-paris-agreement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jun/19/reasons-to-be-cheerful-despite-trump-withdrawing-from-the-paris-agreement","fields":{"headline":"Reasons to be cheerful, despite Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement","bodyText":"The United States has abdicated responsibility from the Paris Climate Agreement – going where only Syria and Nicaragua have gone before, in refusing to play by globally agreed rules. While this is a blow for the fight against climate change, recent history suggests that a new “G3” – the EU, China and India – can fill the vacuum in leadership, plus the private sector in the US is already committed to renewable energy. There are three reasons to be hopeful: 1) US private sector and finance still support renewables The US is a leading source of renewable energy technology and finance, and is at the forefront of research around emerging frontiers such as energy storage. It has pledged the largest amount to the Green Climate Fund ($3bn) of which $1bn has already been disbursed. The rest of the contribution is now threatened, which could be an impediment to technology transfer to the developing world. However the American private sector is likely to step up in its quest to reach global markets and push towards price competitiveness as well. Signals from industry support this – General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt recently tweeted: “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” On the financing side, the increasing value of renewables may mitigate the effect of any reductions to the Green Climate Fund. For example, 2016 saw deals in many countries where the cost of solar energy was well below the cost of power from coal. 2) The US is no longer leading the way There have been worries that the US exit from the Paris Agreement will trigger others to do the same. This is unlikely as narratives have shifted away from this being a zero-sum game, towards being a goal that is worth acting upon in national interest. A move away from fossil fuels used to imply losing global competitiveness, but now the prices of renewable energy now suggest otherwise. Europe and the global south, including rising powers India and China remain vocally committed to the Paris Agreement, fighting climate change and adopting renewable energy. The boom in renewable energy investments in India, China, Japan, US and EU countries have led renewable prices to plummet; this is unlikely to abate. We believe that all is not lost – the stars are aligning towards a new triumvirate, consisting of India, China and the EU, that can lead the fight against climate change. Each will bring a unique but complementary set of leadership qualities. 3) The new global leaders are making progress The EU is showing strong leadership on climate change. Several European countries have developed renewable-friendly policies; almost 90% of new capacity in Europe in 2016 came from renewables. A strong private sector has been expanding globally as well. Statements made by the leadership – such as the EU/China joint statement, and Italy, France and Germany’s refusal to renegotiate Paris – are positive signs. The combined EU pledge to the Green Climate Fund, at $4.8bn, is significant; however, financing flows towards the global south will have to increase, through the development finance or private investment. We don’t know whether that will happen, although the EU is showing signs of a more assertive foreign policy (in response to Brexit, a withdrawing America, and a more assertive Russia) and the architects of a new EU consensus on development are promising to step into the leadership gap left by the US. China has articulated its desire to lead, and has backed it up with domestic actions. While meeting domestic targets will support the Paris Agreement’s agenda, it could step into more of a global leadership role by extending its expertise and financial support for infrastructure in developing countries. This can be done by including it as a core component to its various bilateral project development initiatives (such as in Africa), as well as by leveraging multilateral institutions such as the New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. For India, a knowledge-rich and resource-lite approach may be the most feasible due to financial constraints. It has been aggressively building renewable capacity, and could well exceed Paris targets – the draft National Electricity Plan projects that 57% of electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027, compared to the Paris target of 40% by 2030. This plan projects that no new coal-based power will be required; the recent cancellation of coal-based power projects back this up. India has also pushed for a commercially sound policy framework, exemplified by its auction system. Though not without flaws, India’s experiences are invaluable and can be shared with other developing countries through research and development, capacity building, technical assistance and project development via experienced Indian firms. One promising route is through the International Solar Alliance (hosted by India), which will seek to promote innovative policies, demonstration projects, and capacity building measures, as well as leverage financial instruments to mobilise over $1tn investments by 2030. While the American exit has been a setback for the global fight against climate change, India, China and EU should view this as an opportunity to lead. This will not, by itself, close the gap to achieve the two degrees Celsius goal, but it could flip the narrative and propel a virtuous cycle of action by others. Supported by a sound commercial argument, now is the time for the new G3 to demonstrate climate leadership. Kabir Nanda is a senior consultant and Varad Pande is a partner at Dalberg.

Achieving the Paris goals requires leaving most of the world’s fossil fuel reserves in the ground. A first step must be to stop subsidising fossil fuel production. Wednesday’s budget is an acid test of the government’s Paris commitment. In last year’s budget, the chancellor gave £1.3bn in new tax breaks and direct funding to the oil industry. The UK Treasury receives a smaller share of oil revenues than most other comparable countries. Meanwhile, the government has exempted a whole new fossil-fuel industry – fracking – from half of its tax, despite huge local opposition wherever it is proposed. The government has slashed support for wind and solar energy, costing thousands of jobs. Yet its free-market rationale does not apply when it comes to the oil and gas industry, which has received continued government support even in times of super-normal profits. The chancellor has to change course. He should scrap subsidies that keep the British economy hooked on fossil fuels, and instead set out a strategy to help communities currently dependent on fossil fuel jobs to diversify and to rebuild around world-leading clean technology.

He is, of course, correct, and so we urgently need to implement an effective response. The obvious way to do this would be to cut global greenhouse emissions now, but electorates are still utterly unwilling to accept the radical lifestyle changes we need to achieve this. No western government would dare double petrol prices or remove our ability to repeatedly fly abroad for holidays. No developing-country leaders are going to tell their people they can never have a western lifestyle. The only politically feasible solutions are technological ones, such as carbon scrubbing and geoengineering. Therefore, David Cameron and other world leaders need to start making a massive investment in those areas now, possibly funded by an international financial transactions tax. Otherwise, we do face disaster. Richard Mountford Tonbridge, Kent • The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association (Budget 2016: Osborne to cut an extra £4bn, 14 March) is guilty of some very selective arithmetic. If an RPI increase in fuel duty represents an increase of £450 per truck per year, then the 40p drop in fuel prices we have enjoyed over the last few years represents a decrease of £24,000 per truck. I wonder how many hauliers have reduced their prices to reflect this. The low fuel prices are a heaven-sent opportunity for the chancellor to raise some serious revenue. If the RPI 0.75p rise would bring in £345.5m, then a 20p rise could raise over £9bn with motorists and hauliers still better off than when prices reached their peak. That would save a great deal of pain elsewhere in the economy. Keith Potter Gunnislake, Cornwall • The proposed CMA reforms in the gas and electricity distribution sector are a grave disappointment (Report, 11 March); its intention to “enable competition to grow further” may be misguided. We don’t need another layer of expensive administration the costs of which will inevitably be passed on to consumers. And it will take too long to implement. Since nationalisation, this industry has lost its moral compass and become more concerned with maximising shareholder profit than providing a minimal cost reliable service. The intention of encouraging consumers to migrate to cheaper deals is admirable, but it is optimistic to believe that this will lead to lower overall costs rather than merely redistributing the same total billing charges over the same customers. Would it not have been simpler, easier and quicker to make each major supplier improve the lot of their own existing customers that have been on a standard variable tariff (SVT) for say more than two years by moving them on to that company’s best fixed one-year tariff? The suppliers could be mandated to make this move within six months and to maintain such customers on a similarly priced fixed tariff for at least four further years. The current practice of migrating customers at the termination of a fixed price period on to a SVT unless the customer makes an effort to stay on a better tariff should be banned. The default should be to move them to another reasonably priced term tariff. Iain Oldcorn Ascot, Berkshire • It has been said that the Hinkley Point imbroglio has led to a missed opportunity to install the equivalent capacity over the period up to 2024, probably at lower cost as with power actually becoming steadily available over the construction period (Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug, 14 March). As it happens, the current cost per megawatt of providing wind and solar power is about the same as that for building Hinkley Point. But as the sale price for Hinkley Point output is inflation-proofed by the government up to 2092, wind and solar power are certain to continue coming down from today’s prices. It is of course true that wind and solar cannot be relied on for continuous electricity in all weather conditions. But nuclear power has consistently failed to function at the levels of baseload for which it has been designed. And that also requires back-up reserve plants, thus improving the relative performance of the alternative fuels. Wind and solar power consume fuel that is cost-free, and therefore uses 100% of its potential, whereas nuclear and fossil power wastes about a third of its fuel. They also lose a large proportion of the remaining two thirds in transmission costs from generating plants over long distance to connect with the grid. Wind and solar power coming from smaller generating plants can and should be connected to local networks and will therefore be able to reduce losses in transmission. This will also reduce the length, cost and viability of any new pylon lines. Thus, had we committed ourselves to a 10-year programme of non-nuclear electricity, we would have achieved a steady increase in output and eliminated the risk of the lights going out with the stubborn persistence in choosing Hinkley Point. Harvey Cole Winchester, Hampshire • In his article on Hinkley Point, your journalist writes “business solutions are often described as zero-sum, or win-win”. In fact, zero-sum (+1 -1) means the opposite: one winner, one loser.

And indeed the argument can still be heard that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will ruin our economies – even that it will return us to a pre-industrial living standard. A quarter of a century later, the approach that we took has been richly vindicated. As research published on Monday by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit demonstrates, in that period the average Briton has grown richer faster than citizens of any other G7 nation; at the same time, his or her carbon footprint has fallen faster than in any other G7 nation. While it would be stretching reality to argue that Britain’s economic success has been driven by its climate change policies, no one can seriously argue any more that our climate policies have generated economic harm. I would argue that there are three principal factors why Britain tops the G7 league in terms of growing our economy while reducing our carbon emissions. We started earlier than most, we have been consistent, and we have used market forces wherever possible. Certainly our decision now looks to have been a prudent investment. British companies in low-carbon goods and services already turn over an estimated £83bn per year; and with Brexit opening the door for a new era of free trade with major countries in Asia and Latin America, most of which are pursuing their own clean energy transitions, this sector has the potential to become a major engine of trade and growth. When I was negotiating the UN climate convention 25 years ago, the reality was that we did not know what it would cost to fulfil the treaty’s goal of preventing “dangerous” climate change. Science had not clearly told us what degree of global warming would be “dangerous”; nor did any government have a fully fledged plan for reversing the upward tide of carbon emissions. We acted in the absence of perfect information because we had to. Margaret Thatcher had warned world leaders three years previously that humanity was “changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways”, and that the only route to curbing it was a global treaty that did not constrain economic growth – because only growing economies would be able to afford the investment necessary to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. To a certain extent, her global climate treaty was a leap of faith in both the probity and the innovative capacity of humankind. Since 1992 science has shown us ever more clearly what “dangerous” climate change looks like. Meanwhile, evidence has been growing that a transition to a low-carbon economy is economically feasible, and will bring added benefits such as cleaner air in major cities. These two factors drove all governments to conclude the Paris agreement in 2015. Globally, carbon emissions have remained flat for the past three years, even as the world economy has grown by 7.5%. China and India are fast reversing their previous policies of building greater fleets of coal-fired power stations. Replacing our own use of coal with gas and renewable energy has brought UK carbon emissions down to a level last seen during the general strike of 1926. Yet neither these remarkable developments nor the Paris agreement will secure a stable climate. The latest science tells us that greenhouse gas emissions need to start declining by 2020 at the latest in order to give reasonable confidence that global warming will stay well below the 2C limit, the target governments adopted in Paris. So, having halted the once unstoppable tide, the next logical step is to reverse it – and quickly. This is the mission on which a new initiative launched by Christiana Figueres, until recently the UN’s top climate official, will embark this coming week. Figueres is to be commended for her vision. The rationale remains exactly that which the British government put forward 25 years ago: thatunchecked, climate change presents unacceptable risks for the future. Fortunately these are not risks that we have to take. Britain has proved the doom-mongers wrong: economies can thrive while emissions fall. Now let us put our collective weight behind the Figueres initiative, and finish the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T14:55:45Z","webTitle":"Robert Llewellyn's quest to spur a green energy revolution in his village","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","fields":{"headline":"Robert Llewellyn's quest to spur a green energy revolution in his village","bodyText":"Robert Llewellyn is not a typical eco-activist. “Oh, I’m absolutely un-green,” says the actor and TV presenter. “I’m as un-green as a corporate exec. I fly a lot. Though I have hugged a tree. Actually, I’ve lent against one while I was having a wee in the woods, I’m not sure if that counts?” You don’t need to wear an environmental hairshirt, however, to believe it’s possible to live in a different, more sustainable way. For the actor, who presented Scrapheap Challenge on Channel 4 and is best known for playing Kryten on BBC2’s Red Dwarf, that belief stemmed from a longstanding passion for new technologies, particularly renewable energy. Why, he wondered, were we all powering our cars, cities and homes with carbon-based energy, shipped hundreds of miles or more from big, polluting power plants? Surely technological advances meant we could be generating our power in different ways, and much closer to home? Even, perhaps, if you lived in a tiny clutch of houses in the Cotswolds countryside? So Llewellyn set out to test his thesis in his home village in Gloucestershire. The result is The Great Village Green Crusade, to be screened on Thursday on BBC4, which captures Llewellyn’s quest to persuade Temple Guiting, a community that has been around since the Domesday Book, that it could generate its own electricity and find itself at the cutting edge of the green energy revolution. That, at least, was the plan. The year-long quest was in fact filmed over two and a half, owing to the daunting and occasionally insurmountable hurdles that Llewellyn and a small band of heroically enthusiastic neighbours encountered almost every step of the way. “We didn’t have to fake any jeopardy, that’s for sure,” he says. The biggest problem, to Llewellyn’s surprise, was not convincing residents of the village where he has lived for 25 years (“another 25 and you’ll almost be local,” according to a local farmer). His pitch to the community was not moral but economic, highlighting the fact that the village could make money from the scheme. “But what was interesting was a lot of people saying: ‘We can’t treat the planet the way we have been, we have to change.’ Particularly the older members of the village, who you would think might be the most dismissive of it, were really keen.” Temple Guiting sits on a small tributary of the Thames, near pleasingly blustery low hills and under as much sun as any other spot in the south-west of England. But Llewellyn’s hopes that hydroelectric, wind or solar power would prove an easy solution to the village’s energy needs and allow them to feed a surplus to the national grid, generating income for the village, were rapidly dashed. The stream in Temple Guiting did not have enough force to make hydroelectric power feasible. The options for solar energy were also limited – not, as one might think, because of the British weather, but thanks to tree cover (“the village is built in a wood, basically”) and, inevitably, listing restrictions. But the biggest problem emerged when Llewellyn started looking into wind energy and was told he could generate all the power he liked, but because of the ageing infrastructure of their local branch of the national grid there was no practical way to upload it to the network. “That was genuinely really depressing, because it just felt like – there’s no way round this.” A solution – or a start, at least – was eventually found. Within a few months, the villagers hope, they will install their first solar panels on the roof of a farmer’s barn; he will pay them for the energy, generating a small income (“more than a jumble sale but it’s not a vast amount of money”) for the village. It is, insists Llewellyn, only the beginning. The National Grid may not be able to take their power, but huge leaps forward in battery technology mean Temple Guiting should be able to generate more energy – from a range of sources that could include small-scale domestic solar or wind generators – and store it in the village. “That’s the next phase, and that’s what I would love to do here – that we all buy electricity off each other.” Within five years, he hopes, Temple Guiting could be in a position to run its own small power company. Which might be fine in a tiny community where a local enthusiast knows everyone, but is this replicable in bigger towns and cities? “Oh it’s certainly replicable, simply because a lot of other communities have already done it,” he says. The actor cites schemes in Oxford, Brixton and even on Orkney, and the film shows Llewellyn travelling to Las Vegas, which meets all of its municipal power needs through renewable energy, leading Llewellyn to jokingly attempt to twin Temple Guiting with Sin City. “If we were genuinely the first people to try this then you could say: ‘God, it’s crazy, don’t even try.’ But there are an enormous number of examples of other communities who have done this on a much bigger scale, and it’s very successful. So yes, this is very, very doable.” After putting so much personal energy into the project, he must be looking forward to seeing the panels finally going up on the farmer’s roof? “It will be nice when it’s on there,” he says. “Though it’s been such a hard slog that rather than cheering, I might just have a long sleep.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2017 to use lower case in a reference to the national grid to differentiate the country’s electricity transmission network from National Grid, an international energy company based in the UK and US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/nov/24/adani-to-build-one-of-worlds-most-advanced-solar-farms-near-queensland-mining-town","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-24T05:57:36Z","webTitle":"Adani to build 'one of world's most advanced' solar farms near Queensland mining town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/adani-to-build-one-of-worlds-most-advanced-solar-farms-near-queensland-mining-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/nov/24/adani-to-build-one-of-worlds-most-advanced-solar-farms-near-queensland-mining-town","fields":{"headline":"Adani to build 'one of world's most advanced' solar farms near Queensland mining town","bodyText":"Adani, which is vying to build Australia’s largest coalmine, has announced the site of a $200m solar farm near a central Queensland mining town. The Indian energy conglomerate plans to build a 100-200 MW solar plant on 600ha that was formerly part of the Rugby Run grazing property near Moranbah. Adani, India’s largest solar generator, said on Thursday the Rugby Run solar farm would be “one of the world’s most advanced solar energy plants”. The company’s first solar foray in Australia has prompted rare praise from environmental groups, including one that has taken it on in court over its bitterly contested Carmichael coal project near Bowen. Peter McCallum, of Mackay Conservation Group, said on Monday the company’s latest move would bring it far more widespread support. “Adani is fundamentally an energy company, not a miner, and its expertise is shifting rapidly towards becoming a clean energy producer in India and now in Australia.” Rugby Run is the first of a number of solar projects through which Adani plans to provide up to 1500MW in Australia within the next five years. Adani said: “The solar projects are part of Adani’s balanced approach to power generation with coal-fired, solar and wind plants supporting the energy policies of the nations in which Adani operates.” Anne Baker, the mayor of Isaac regional council, said the solar plant was an “exciting” development for a local government area that contains 24 of Queensland’s operating coalmines and produces 63% of its saleable coal. “It’s fantastic to see a project that will diversify our economy from its dominant mining base,” she said. Adani said it would start building the Rugby Run plant in mid-2017 and finish within 12 months. The construction would create up to 350 jobs, while five fulltime staff would then operate the solar farm. Adani has applied to public utility Powerlink to connect the plant and feed into the state electricity network. The company has built 793MW of solar generating capacity in India to date, including one of the world’s largest solar plants, a 648MW facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/apr/18/naval-power-mauritius-looks-to-perth-base-for-renewable-energy-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-17T22:53:56Z","webTitle":"Naval power: Mauritius looks to Perth base for renewable energy solutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/18/naval-power-mauritius-looks-to-perth-base-for-renewable-energy-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/18/naval-power-mauritius-looks-to-perth-base-for-renewable-energy-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Naval power: Mauritius looks to Perth base for renewable energy solutions","bodyText":"As home to Australia’s largest naval base, it is no surprise that foreign governments are curious about the secretive goings-on at Garden Island, just offshore from Perth in Western Australia. Peering across from the other side of the Indian Ocean, the Mauritian government is not gathering intelligence on Australia’s military power, however – but rather how the military is powered. More interesting to this tiny island nation than the warships churning in and out of the HMAS Stirling port are the strange hockey puck-shaped undersea CETO 6 tidal energy buoys tethered to the ocean floor. Flush with the kind of research and development cash most Indian Ocean-bordering countries can only dream of, the Royal Australian Navy is developing a $7.5m renewables-based microgrid initially featuring a mix of solar energy (2MW), battery storage (2MW) and a desalination plant, before eventually incorporating undersea wave energy generators that will harness the power of the formidable surf that rolls past this thin fleck of land before crashing upon Perth’s famous beaches. Island nations see Garden Island as a potential template for an energy mix that could help combat the climate change that threatens their very existence. The head honchos in the Australian military are warriors, not eco-warriors, and their preference for renewables is motivated by a belief that they are simply the best strategic option: rather than rely on a vulnerable connection with the mainland power grid or on diesel generators that require the importing of fuel, the RAH has opted for a truly self-sufficient system. Impressed by what has been achieved so far at HMAS Stirling – the project will start generating energy in mid-2017 – the Mauritian government has roped in Carnegie Clean Energy, the Australian developers of the Garden Island microgrid, to draw up a renewable energy roadmap for the country backed with a $800,000 contribution from the Australian and Mauritian governments. Mauritius is targeting renewable energy production exceeding 35% of the electricity generation mix by 2025 from a 2016 level of 20% (mostly sugarcane-based generation). Yet Carnegie’s managing director, Mike Ottaviano, tells the Guardian that his company is designing a microgrid solution that could reach an even more ambitious target of 65% within a decade, vastly exceeding the targets of many major industrialised economies. “They know their solar resource, their wind resource, really well but they don’t know their surf resource, so we’ve deployed measurement buoys in the ocean at the most prospective sites, doing recordings which will allow us to model resource around the island to work out the best place to build,” he says. Ottaviano is setting up his company to serve as a “one-stop shop” for island microgrids, offering design, construction, operation and maintenance services. “I think there’s no community more ready for a renewable microgrid than an island, for a range of reasons,” he says. “The fact they feel the effect of climate change more than most is absolutely a big driver. Layer that with the cost of power on islands, reliance on diesel and the energy security point of view – that’s why they are early adopters.” Analysis released in late 2016 by Afrobarometer on opinions about renewables in Mauritius concluded the population is onboard with their government’s aggressive pushing of green energy. University of the South Pacific social scientist Andreas Kopf, who co-authored the analysis, says the biggest surprise was that 70% of the 1200 respondents supported large-scale implementation of renewables, even if it meant higher electricity bills. Just 11% were opposed. “This is remarkable in the sense that people’s concern over the environment and climate frequently makes a halt when their support requires personal real life sacrifices, for instance when they have to dig into their own pocket [even if they could afford it],” he says. “This seems to be somewhat different in the case of Mauritius, where support is still considerably high among those who experience some level of lived poverty.” The 1.3m-strong population of Mauritius are getting their way, with notable renewable energy projects to be rolled out in recent years including a 9MW windfarm by the French company Quadran in 2016 and local firm Sarako Ltd delivering a 15MW solar PV farm in 2014. Carnegie is targeting completion of design of wave energy solutions for the island within a month and Ottaviano says the company is also consulting with Nauru, Kiribati, Cocos Islands and the Seychelles. He cautions, however, that the openness of communities and governments to the technology “doesn’t make it an easy market to crack”. “One factor is they are remote – as an aggregate it is a very large market but the reality is it is fragmented with lots of small islands,” he says. “You are often dealing with poorly funded and poorly capitalised communities and governments, so there are finance challenges. Then there are climatic risks, community risks and dealing with diverse languages and cultures.” Desperate to prove to the world that renewable energy microgrids are the way forward, Mauritius and its island neighbours will be hoping companies like Carnegie determine the risks are worth braving."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/dec/06/google-renewable-energy-target-solar-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-06T16:53:11Z","webTitle":"Google, Apple, Facebook race towards 100% renewable energy target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/06/google-renewable-energy-target-solar-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/06/google-renewable-energy-target-solar-wind-power","fields":{"headline":"Google, Apple, Facebook race towards 100% renewable energy target","bodyText":"Tech giants are jockeying to be the first to hit a 100% renewable energy goal. Google, which has invested in solar and wind energy for a decade, intends to get there by 2017. Google is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, and plans to buy enough wind and solar energy to offset all the electricity used by its 13 data centers and offices in 150 cities worldwide, the company said Tuesday. Apple seems close to reaching its own 100% goal as well. The company said it achieved 93% in 2015. An Apple spokeswoman said the company has yet to set a year for when they would likely cross the finish line. For Google, hitting the 100% target means for every unit of electricity it consumes – typically from coal or natural gas power plants – it would buy a unit of wind or solar electricity. The company wouldn’t say how much electricity it will need to have purchased by the end of next year to reach its 100% goal, but did say that the amount would exceed the 5.7 terawatt-hours solar and wind energy that it bought in 2015. “We want to run our business in an environmentally responsible way, and energy consumption is the largest portion,” said Neha Palmer, head of energy strategy and development at Google’s Global Infrastructure Group. Google is taking a big leap to that 100% goal, having achieved just 37% in 2014. The company has invested in renewable energy ever since it kicked off the construction of a 1.6-megawatt solar energy system in 2006. Since 2010, it’s signed 2.6 gigawatts worth of solar and wind contracts. The tech giant isn’t alone in setting the 100% target. A global campaign to promote 100% renewable energy use in the business world includes Ikea, Facebook, Starbucks and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Businesses, like homeowners, have historically relied on their local utilities for power. In 2015, about 67% of the electricity generated in the US came from fossil fuels. Businesses would have to build and run their own solar or wind farms if they want to hit their 100% more quickly, but that will require hefty investments and expertise they don’t have. As a result, when companies set strong renewable energy goals, they often reach them by buying enough solar and wind electricity or renewable energy credits to offset their use of electricity from coal or natural gas power plants. Some companies, such as Google and Microsoft, have invested in solar and wind power plants to help increase the amount of renewable energy the local electric grids. Or, using their clout as large energy customers, they work on convincing their local utilities to invest in renewable energy. Once extremely expensive, solar and wind have seen their prices falling significantly in the past 10 years. Government tax breaks have also helped to make solar and wind more affordable to both businesses and homeowners. The price for building large solar farms, that have the scale to provide utilities, dropped 12% in 2015, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. Market analysts expect the prices to continue to fall even with the abundance of cheap coal and natural gas. The pressure on countries around the world to meet their targets from the Paris climate agreement, which went into effect last month, will make renewable energy attractive, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The research firm has projected that solar and wind will become the cheapest sources of electricity for “most of the world” after 2030. “Renewable energy has become incredibly cost effective,” said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley. “There is no company on the planet that can’t make a 100% energy target a viable, cost-effective strategy.” Yet most businesses have yet to set a renewable energy target. That’s because cost isn’t the only issue. Big companies tend to have an advantage over smaller firms because they have the resources to understand the energy markets and negotiating contracts to buy renewable energy, said Colin Smith, solar analyst for GTM Research. “You’re talking about very complex deals and arrangements with unique risk profiles that most companies aren’t fully well equipped to understand,” he said. Google currently pays for wind and solar power from 20 renewable energy projects in the US and abroad, in places such as Sweden and Chile. However, it doesn’t limit itself to buying solar and wind only in regions where it operates, and sees itself as a champion of reducing the emissions produced by the electric industry, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. “Wind and solar developers couldn’t get financing without us guaranteeing to pay for the power in the long term,” said Palmer. Setting the 100% renewable energy goal is not the only way to reduce a company’s carbon footprint, said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University. Businesses should first look at cutting down on their energy use and becoming more energy efficient, said Reicher. That will then reduce the amount of renewable energy they need to procure. “Energy efficiency tends not to sound as sexy, just as putting solar panels on your roof is more interesting than putting an efficient furnace in your basement,” he said. “But from an economic and environmental perspective, you want to start with energy efficiency.” Reicher also noted that electricity isn’t always the biggest source of energy for a business. FedEx, for example, uses far more energy in transportation, he said. “Often a big chunk of a company’s business goes beyond electricity,” said Reicher. “What are they doing on the industrial side, on the transportation side, for heating and cooling?” The election of Donald Trump as president has worried renewable energy supporters about the progress made to make solar and wind competitive against coal and natural gas. With the new administration under Donald Trump, renewable energy supporters worry that the government will stop supporting renewable energy. Trump has vowed to revive the coal industry, which has seen half a dozen bankruptcies in recent years as it struggles to compete with the cheaper natural gas. But whether the new administration will create anti-renewable energy policies remains to be seen, Reicher said. Google doesn’t anticipate changes to its renewable energy initiatives in the near future. “The results of any one election won’t change our plans,” said Palmer."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/03/its-way-past-time-to-speak-truth-to-climate-arguments-this-stupid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-03T00:16:49Z","webTitle":"It's way past time to speak truth to climate arguments this stupid | Lenore Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/03/its-way-past-time-to-speak-truth-to-climate-arguments-this-stupid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/03/its-way-past-time-to-speak-truth-to-climate-arguments-this-stupid","fields":{"headline":"It's way past time to speak truth to climate arguments this stupid","bodyText":"For precious decades experts have explained, over and over, that the science of climate change is incontrovertible, the consequences of blindly sticking with fossil fuels catastrophic and the costs of inaction far higher than switching to a low-emissions economy. But these facts had no impact on the sceptics, who cling to a worldview where they find “alternative facts”, where fossil fuel power is the only path to prosperity and mounting environmental and economic evidence to the contrary is some kind of dastardly leftwing plot. For Tony Abbott’s economic adviser Maurice Newman, global warming was a “hook” used by the United Nations to impose a new world order in opposition to “capitalism and freedom”. To Donald Trump it is a “hoax” propagated by the Chinese to undermine the US while the rest of the world rolls around laughing. The only skerrick of positive news from sceptics’ greatest victory yet – the US president’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord – is that it seems to have galvanised politicians, scientists, business leaders and economists who have grown weary from all these years talking to the hand. Because now it is clearer than ever that the economic interests Trump claims to defend can only be served by acting on global warming. It is way past time to speak some more loud, blunt truth to arguments this stupid. To make the ridiculous case that abandoning Paris was good for the US economy, Trump didn’t just have to ignore science, but also the pleading of the US business community he was purporting to defend – the 630 business leaders who wrote to him in January demanding that he keep Barack Obama’s climate plan and stick with the Paris deal, and the long list of businesses and business leaders who have attacked his decision, including the chief executives of Tesla, Goldman Sachs and Disney and companies including Nike, BP, IBM, Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Adobe, Morgan Stanley, Unilever and Mars. The truth is, he has clear evidence that renewable energy jobs in the US are booming and that his campaign promises on coal industry jobs will be impossible to keep. The contentious job figures he advanced to make his case for abandoning Paris came from a study which made some highly questionable assumptions to reach its conclusions, including that it would “not take into account potential benefits from avoided emissions”. The real-world evidence is very different. As the director of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, points out in the Conversation: “The increase in employment in solar energy alone over the past three years is more than twice the total number of jobs in the coalmining industry in the United States (which are declining).” Meanwhile in Australia, the mind-numbing years of climate “war” have ground us to a policy paralysis. Malcolm Turnbull dare not make a decisive move lest he startle the sceptics and fossil fuel advocates still lurking in his own party ranks (like the visionary Craig Kelly, chair of the Coalition’s environment committee, who tweeted he had “champagne on ice” in preparation for the Trump announcement, then celebrated it by declaring: “There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it’s just that mankind hasn’t yet worked it out yet”). And so the government continues its zigzag trajectory – quietly searching for a viable policy while periodically veering back to mouth some nonsense to calm the conservatives. It has reaffirmed its backing for the Paris agreement but still has no policy to meet its commitments and has rejected, for raw political reasons, some of the best options available to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who has been charged with finding something resembling a solution. Turnbull talks with real enthusiasm about the manifold possibilities of renewable power and pumped hydro storage, but then his treasurer fondles coal in question time. The government carefully floats the idea of a low-emissions energy target – not dissimilar to the existing renewable energy target, which could be reasonable policy but could also be risible if the emissions benchmarks allow it to cover what the minerals’ industry PR likes to refer to as “low-emissions” coal-fired power without insisting its emissions be captured and stored. It claims to understand the maths of the climate threat confronting the world and then (like Queensland Labor) considers massive taxpayer subsidies to help the enormous new Adani coalmine that would, on its own, contribute 0.5% of all the carbon that can be emitted before the globe exceeds 2C warming when its coal is burned. Like Trump, politicians tout the Queensland mine as a provider of regional jobs, “tens of thousands” of them, they say, again and again. But to believe that you have to ignore Adani’s own expert witness, who admitted in court the actual jobs figure was just 1,464 direct and indirect positions. To accept the project’s commercial viability you have to ignore the assessment of the biggest Australian banks, which have concluded they would not lend to a project of this type – or, if you are the resources minister, Matt Canavan, even try to foment a consumer revolt against them for reaching that commercial conclusion. And to argue this is the best use of a taxpayer subsidy you have to close your eyes to the many thousands of actual jobs governments are, or could be, supporting in the renewable industry in the same general region, projects such as the Whitsunday solar farm, the Longreach solar farm, the Kidston solar farm, the Collinsville solar power station or Telstra’s $100m project announced this week at Emerald. To insist that coal will play a long-term part in Australia’s new energy generation you have to wilfully ignore the reality of the targets we’ve set ourselves, the ones we say we will stick to, and the plummeting costs of renewables such as solar and wind. The truth is, we really cannot walk both sides of this street. We’re either on the side of Trump and his sceptics, or on the side of the facts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2019/may/15/may-to-face-mps-as-rebels-warn-she-is-still-facing-defeat-in-brexit-vote-in-early-june-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-15T16:17:25Z","webTitle":"UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs vote down withdrawal agreement, ministers insist – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/15/may-to-face-mps-as-rebels-warn-she-is-still-facing-defeat-in-brexit-vote-in-early-june-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2019/may/15/may-to-face-mps-as-rebels-warn-she-is-still-facing-defeat-in-brexit-vote-in-early-june-live-news","fields":{"headline":"UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs vote down withdrawal agreement, ministers insist – as it happened","bodyText":"Downing Street has hinted that the Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement bill will be make or break for Theresa May’s future as prime minister, as ministers have warned that, if she loses, the UK will face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. (See 3.20pm.) Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has urged the home secretary to introduce flexible immigration rules for skilled workers after Brexit to avoid vacancies in certain industries. As the Press Association reports, Gove claims to have called on Sajid Javid to “look flexibly in how we interpret what a skilled worker is,” and criticised the £30,000 salary threshold for immigrant workers. Giving evidence to Holyrood’s rural economy committee, Gove said that assessing whether a migrant worker qualified as skilled by their salary was not appropriate for all industries. Questioned about “significant vacancies” of approximately 30% in the fish processing sector in Scotland by the SNP’s Stewart Stevenson, Gove argued that the migration advisory committee’s recommendation of the minimum earnings for a worker to be allowed to stay after Brexit would harm businesses who rely on foreign labour. Gove said: Pitching the level at which you define a skilled worker as someone earning over £30,000 a year wasn’t actually responsive to the particular needs - not just of the fish processing sector - but the food and drink sector overall. One of the points that I have made to the home secretary and others is that we look flexibly at how we interpret what a skilled worker is in line with specific industries. Four members of the Welsh assembly - three Ukip AMs and Mark Reckless, who left Ukip in 2017 to join the Conservative group - have defected to the Brexit party. They have asked to be recognised as an official Brexit party group in the assembly. (See 3.29pm.) The consumers organisation Which? has criticised Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, for saying chlorinated chicken is not a food safety issue. (See 11.17am.) In a statement Caroline Normand, the Which? director of advocacy, said: Liam Fox is wrong to suggest chlorinated chicken is not a food safety and standards issue. One of the reasons why food-borne disease rates are so much higher in the US is that these measures are often used as a desperate attempt to make up for widespread safety problems in food production - leaving bacteria like salmonella to run rampant. Our research has shown British consumers are united in their opposition to lowering food standards as part of any future trade deal - with nearly seven in 10 saying they would be uncomfortable eating chlorine-washed chicken. Brexit is an opportunity to design a joined up food and farming policy that ensures food is produced to the highest standards - the nation’s health needs must not be used as a bargaining chip that could be given away to facilitate transatlantic trade. Labour’s plan to nationalise Britain’s energy network would make the country poorer, hinder efforts to tackle climate change, and threatens a return to the frequent power cuts of the past, the UK’s leading business lobby group has warned. Parliament is to receive an overhaul of its publicly displayed art work, with dozens of former and current female politicians and campaigners to be introduced to the walls of the Palace of Westminster. The government does not know how many British users may have been affected by a “terrifying” WhatsApp security breach, MPs have been told. As the Press Association reports, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson warned a security flaw in the messaging app could be used by states to monitor human rights groups. The digital minister, Margot James, said the likelihood of there being UK victims of the attack is being investigated but said, as yet, there is no information about how many people could have been targeted. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Anne Milton, the skills minister. Good job it’s not national literacy day ... Theresa May is now in Paris for an event with world leaders who are agreeing a plan to eliminate terrorist and violent content online. It is called the Christchurch Call because New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has worked up the plan in response to the Christchurch mosque attacks in March. Here is some new polling on the European elections from Survation. The House of Commons library often produces the best briefings on election results, and it has now published its document (pdf) on the English local elections. If you want a very detailed account, this is what you need. Here’s a chart from the report. The government’s claim that a vote against the withdrawal agreement in June will leave the UK with a choice between no-deal and no Brexit depends on the assumption that the EU will not agree to another article 50 extension. As explained at 9.52am, that assumption is not well founded. And now it has emerged that Jacek Czaputowicz, Poland’s foreign minister, has said publicly that the EU should be willing to grant another extension to allow time for the UK to change its mind about Brexit. As Reuters reports, in comments released late last night, Czaputowicz said: From Poland’s point of view, it would be good if Brexit would not happen. It’s a matter of changing the rhetoric to let the Brits rethink their decision. We should go soft on Britain, give them time, they are still in the EU, let’s give them space to take decision. Change UK MPs are criticising Labour after Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman refused to rule out the party abstaining on the EU withdrawal agreement bill at a briefing. This is from Chuka Umunna. And this is from Chris Leslie. Four Welsh assembly members are seeking to band together to form a Brexit party group. The four include Mark Reckless, who has been a Tory MP and a Ukip and Tory AM. He has resigned from the Tory group. The three others, Mandy Jones, Caroline Jones and David Rowlands, have all been Ukip AMs. They have written to the Llywydd - the assembly’s equivalent of a speaker – notifying her of their wish to form a political group. Mark Reckless told a press conference on the Senedd steps: Brexit is being blocked and the Brexit party group in the Welsh assembly from today will be supporting Nigel Farage, supporting the Brexit party in everything that they are doing to protect our democracy and to ensure that Brexit is delivered. Other parties are not happy. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: We consider this announcement today as having very serious implications for our democracy and our democratic principles here in the Senedd. The Brexit party did not stand and were not elected in the 2016 elections. They have no democratic mandate and they should not be permitted to form a group nor given access to public resources and funding in the Senedd. To permit them to form a group would make a mockery of our democratic system in Wales. The Senedd is not a playground for Brexiteer chancers, it is the home of Welsh democracy. We eagerly anticipate the Llywydd’s ruling in the full expectation that she will do the right thing and allow democracy to prevail. This is what Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told the Lords EU committee earlier about how a defeat for the EU withdrawal agreement bill at second reading would leave the UK a choice between a no-deal Brexit and no Brexit. He said: I think if the House of Commons does not approve the WAB then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the house will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue ... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke. This is what Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was also saying this morning (see 11.17am), as well as Downing Street. (See 9.52am.) Labour sources are playing down suggestions the party might abstain on the EU withdrawal agreement bill, PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield reports. HuffPost’s Paul Waugh thinks that in the end Labour won’t abstain on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Theresa May has been offered a possible lifeline ahead of a key vote on her Brexit deal next month after Labour refused to rule out abstaining. The government has announced that MPs will vote on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first week in June, in what will effectively be the fourth vote on May’s withdrawal agreement. If the government were to lose, that would be fatal to May’s Brexit strategy, and her premiership, and there is no evidence she is winning over the MPs who voted against it last time. (See 9.25am.) But Labour has refused to rule out abstaining in the second reading vote. It is highly unusual for the opposition to abstain on such a major piece of legislation, and if Labour were to adopt this approach (which is nothing more than an option at the moment, based on this afternoon’s briefing), anti-Brexit members would be alarmed. But an abstention would lead to the bill getting a second reading, with the key vote effectively postponed until MPs voted on the amended bill at third reading. Labour’s move came as ministers argued that, if MPs were to vote down the bill, the UK would face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. (See 11.17am.) The lead candidate for Change UK in Scotland’s European parliament contest has switched sides to the Liberal Democrats, in further signs the new party is struggling to consolidate itself or spread successfully across the UK. (See 10.36am.) Jeremy Corbyn has used PMQs to attack the “scandal of inequality in modern Britain”. He said: In Great Yarmouth, one has just been opened for pupils at a school, and last week the department of business established a food bank for its own staff in the building on Victoria Street. Can the prime minister tell us what is going wrong in modern Britain that a government office in the centre of London has a food bank for some of its very low-paid staff to get something to eat? In response, May argued that inequality was also a problem under Labour and that income inequality had fallen since 2010. Lone parents and their children have lost challenges against the government’s benefit cap at the UK’s highest court. Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, has said she would like a planned new law offering an amnesty on historical prosecutions for military veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan and anywhere else around the world to also cover Northern Ireland. The government has been criticised for rejecting a proposed working definition of Islamophobia that has been adopted by parties including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn will outline plans to nationalise Britain’s energy network in a move that would transfer companies to public ownership soon after a Labour election win. A catalogue of errors by the Home Office has led to a loss of access to £600,000 of EU funds earmarked for the most deprived people in Britain and has put a further £2.9m at risk, it can be revealed. Here is more on Labour refusing to rule out abstaining on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. From the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And these are from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart. PMQs - Snap verdict: Yesterday, in response to Bridget Prentice’s resignation from the party, Labour issued a statement saying its “bold and popular policies under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership have changed the political conversation in this country” and today he focused on a topic, inequality, where undoubtedly opinion is moving his way. You can argue about how much this is due to Corbyn personally - even that bastion of neoliberalism, the IMF, was warning about inequality in 2014, long before Corbyn became Labour leader - but the announcement this week that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has launched a major review of the consequences of inequality is a clear vindication of one of core political themes. The IFS has always been much more associated with fiscal rectitude than social justice, and if even it recognises there is a problem, Corbyn is winning the argument. A sensible prime minister would recognise this, and engage. But instead May just refused to accept that there is anything wrong. It was an unconvincing performance that saw her easily outmatched by Corbyn. But it was still all a bit underwhelming - largely because, with May effectively now at the point where she is working out her notice, who cares what she has to say anyway? This became painfully apparent when she had to respond to a question about the next spending round - which is one that will be overseen by her successor. In her exchanges with Corbyn, and the SNP’s Ian Blackford, it felt that May was not even trying particularly hard. But PMQs did throw up two policies issues where the debate over the coming months is likely to intensify. Corbyn proudly defended Labour’s plan to extend its real living wage to under-18s. There is a genuine debate to be had about whether this can be done without increasing youth unemployment, but the arguments did not really get much of a hearing today. Interestingly, May herself chose to raise another Labour proposal - its qualified support for universal basic income. But, again, the rights and wrongs of this were not thrashed out in today’s debate. That will have to wait for another day. Corbyn used to make a point of using the “letter from an ordinary voter” device to frame an awkward question for the PM. Today it was the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone who tried this. It allowed him to tell May she should resign, but in a manner that discouraged a blunt response (because the activists who supposedly drafted this letter would deserve a polite reply). But Bone just got the usual May brush-off. Even calls for May’s resignation can’t really enliven PMQs very much now. Stephen Kerr, a Conservative, says Scottish Tories see May as a trenchant champion of the union. Does May agree the shared prosperity fund will provide an opportunity to strengthen the union? Will it be led by needs, and not Barnettised? May says the fund will strengthen the union, and it will be led be needs. And that’s it. PMQs is over. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says he has got an incredible group of activists in his constituency who have campaigned regularly for the party. But he has a letter from them. They do not like her Brexit deal. And they have lost confidence in May. They want her to resign before the European elections. What message does May have for them? May praises all Conservatives who campaign. She thanks them for their work. This is a government that wants to deliver Brexit, she says. If MPs had voted for it, the UK would already be out, she says. Labour’s Albert Owen says a constituent died after being shot with a crossbow outside his house. Will the law on crossbows be reviewed? May says this is a very worrying story. Labour’s Louise Haigh asks about a BBC report saying four children have been killed after family courts ordered that abusive parents should have access to them. Will she order a public inquiry? May says new guidance on this was issued to courts last week. The Ministry of Justice has not seen evidence to justify an inquiry, she says, but she says justice minister will meet Haigh to discuss this. Neil O’Brien, a Conservative, asks about access to a particular drug on the NHS. May says she is pleased the NHS and Nice have reached an agreement to make it available. Labour’s Caroline Flint asks May to welcome a ruling condeming the blacklisting of trade unionists. And does she agree that trade unions play an important role? May says unions do have an important role to play. The government wants to see workers rights improved, she says. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, is asking a question about bereaved parents. But she is interrupted by an announcement from a speaker broadcasting into the chamber saying a fire alarm test has been completed. May says this is a worrying time for British Steel workers. The government struck a deal with the company last month to help it meet its obligations under EU emissions laws. Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire says the PM says it is her deal, no-deal or no exit. But MPs have voted against her deal and no-deal. So will she admit it is no Brexit or a second referendum. May says MPs should vote to implement Brexit. Labour’s Barry Sheerman says he was a passionate Eurosceptic when he became an MP 40 years ago. But he changed his mind when he saw what the EU did for peace and prosperity. Will May tell the truth about Europe, instead of echoing the lies told by Ukip? May says people voted to leave the EU. The government should implement that, she says. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks May if she backs the idea of a fund to help universities improve the way they look after students with mental health problems. May says she will ask the health and education secretaries to look at this. Rosie Duffield, a Labour MP, asks if May agrees with Labour about the need to scrap tests for pre-teenage children because they generate stress. May says simple tests that allow judgments to be made about how much children have progressed are useful and should continue. Rebecca Pow, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees Somerset schools need more funding. May says the strong economy allows the government to put more money into schools. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says the Tory backenches look a bit threadbare. The UK is looking a laughing stock. For the sake of the nation, will May go, and let Scotland to too. May says, judging by Wishart’s question, his charm offensive to become next speaker has started. Labour’s Bill Esterson says the government says it wants to tackle climate change. But the reality suggests otherwise. It is investing in fossil fuel projects abroad while denying funding to green energy initiatives. May says the government is investing in the future. She says 99% of solar energy deployed in the UK has been under a Conservative government. Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, asks May to confirm that if the UK stays in the customs union and the single market, it will not have left the EU. May says the UK will end free movement, take control of UK law and end the era of vast payments to the EU. And the UK will not pay for market access, she says. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, says the three-times-defeated Brexit deal will return in June. Has May done a backroom deal with Labour to sell out Scotland. May says it is only the SNP that wants to sell out Scotland. Blackford says the Scottish people do not know what is happening in these secret talks. At the European elections the people of Scotland will make their feelings heard, he says. May says if the SNP vote for the deal, the UK will leave the EU. If people want a party that is not only a Brexit party, but one that can deliver it, they should vote Conservative. Nigel Huddleston, a Conservative, asks if education will get more money in the next spending round. May says the government is committed to improving education for every child. Corbyn says his question was about food banks in a government office. That suggests in-work poverty is the problem, he says. He says the Trussell Trust handed out 1.6m food parcels last year, and 500,000 of them went to children. Will the government restore the link between inflation and welfare payments? May says this government introduced the national living wage. The low paid are taking home a lot more as a result. Corbyn says the IFS says child poverty will rise to over 5m by 2022 because of the government’s policies. The wealth of the richest has inceased by £50bn. But if we do not have enough money to feed people, we have failed as a society. More people are in poverty. When will the government reverse tax giveaways to the rich and end the scandal of inequality in Britain. May says the top 1% are paying more in income tax than they ever did under Labour. Labour is proposing a welfare payment for everyone. That would mean money for the rich paid for by the poor. Corbyn asks how it can be fair for executives to be paid so much more than their workers. Young people suffer in particular, which is why Labour will stop young people being paid a lower minimum wage than older people. Does May agree this is right? May says the Labour policy will cost job. Youth unemployment has fallen by 50%, she says. Corbyn says the Tories opposed the minimum wage. They said it would cost jobs. Why do the Tories continue to punish young people? Wages are lower than a decade ago, housing costs are soared, and more and more food banks are opening. In Great Yarmouth one has been opened for pupils. And the business department has opened one for its staff, he says. May says work is the best way to ensure people have a good standard of living. She says Corbyn has not acknowledged that unemployment is at a record law. She says Corbyn implies inequality started in 2010. But who said the last Labour government ensured inequality got worse. Who was it? Corbyn himself, she says. Corbyn asks about Angus Deaton, the Nobel prize winning economist investigating inequality for the IFS. He says the UK has the second worst record on inequality in the G7. May says wages are going up. Jeremy Corbyn pays tribute to Brian Walden, the former Labour MP and interviewer. He was a formidable interviewer, he says. Every MP has said that - but only afterwards. He also pays tribute to Doris Day, a Hollywood icon and animal rights campaign. He says he is tempted to quote one of her songs - whip crackaway. He says nine hedge fund tycoons have donated millions to the Conservative party. Is this a government for the many or for the few. May also pays tribute to Doris Day. She gave many hours of entertainment, she says. After Corbyn paid tribute to two Labour MPs elected 40 years ago, May says Margaret Thatcher was elected 40 years ago. On inequality, May says income inequality is down since 2010. The Conservatives want everyone to have a better life. Labour wants to bring people down. The Tories want to bring them up. Mark Pawsey, a Conservative, asks about a young carer in his constituency. May says the government has published a cross-government carers’ action plan which is intended to help young carers. The SNP’s Alan Brown asks about transplant case that went wrong. May says she will ensure the relevant minister looks at the case. Theresa May starts by saying she will be going to Paris later for an international summit about stopping terrorists from exploiting the internet. From BrexitCentral’s Jonathan Isaby From the Daily Record’s Torcuil Crichton This is from PA’s Richard Wheeler. PMQs is starting soon. I will post my snap verdict after the whole session is over. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Here is a question from below the line worth addressing. The EU and the UK have agreed to postpone Brexit until 31 October, unless the UK passes the withdrawal agreement before than, which would allow an earlier exit. A British prime minister can unilaterally revoke article 50. But there is no mechanism that would allow a new PM to unilaterally change the 31 October date and trigger an immediate no-deal. That said, a new PM could try to speed the process up by adopting a policy of non-cooperation with the EU (for example, by withholding monthly payments). Or the government could try to bring forward the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act, meaning EU law would no longer apply. But these would be seen as extremely hostile and reckless measures, which would be opposed by parliament and would could cause severe damage to long-term relations with Brussels. Unless Nigel Farage were to become PM before October they are not plausible scenarios, and even he would probably have second thoughts. However, a new PM could insist on a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even if the EU27 all wanted a further extension. That is because article 50 can only be extended again with UK agreement. Turning away from Stephen Barclay for a moment, Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, seems to have made a good impression with the speech she gave this morning. These are from the BBC’s defence correspondent Jonathan Beale. And this is from my colleague John Crace, the Guardian’s sketchwriter. Q: Can you tell us more about the cross-party talks with Labour? Barclay says they have focused on the Labour demands set out in Jeremy Corbyn’s five points. Q: Does the government accept that the MEPs elected next week will have to take their seats? Yes, says Barclay. He says the government wanted to avoid this. Barclay says British MEPs elected next week will take their seats. This means the government has given up hope of trying to pass the Brexit legislation before 2 July, when the new European parliament meets for the first time. Barclay says, if MPs do not vote for the deal next month, it will be dead. Then MPs will face a choice between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50. This is the argument we have also heard from Liam Fox this morning (see 11.17am) and from Number 10. UPDATE: Here is the clip. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Lords EU committee. He says the government is keen to publish the EU withdrawal agreement bill as soon as possible. But it is not possible to lock down the text while the talks with Labour are still going on, he says. Q: Do you accept MPs need time to see it before the second reading vote in June? Barclay says he does accept that. But he says many of the issues raised by the bill have been debated. He says he published an open letter yesterday (pdf) that he sent to the Tory Brexiter John Redwood addressing some of Redwood’s concerns about the bill. Here are the main points from Liam Fox’s Q&amp;A at the Institute for Government. Fox, the international development secretary, said that the UK would face either a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit if MPs vote down Theresa May’s deal again next month. Referring to the vote, he said: There will be an opportunity for MPs to decide, after the local elections, after the European elections, whether they want to vote for Brexit or not. MPs will need to look and see if they want to continue down a path that inexorably takes us to either the potential of revocation of article 50 or leaving without a deal, and ask if they think that’s the best course either democratically or economically for the UK. MPs will have to face that decision. Fox is assuming that the EU will not allow a further article 50 extension, which is not a view shared by those who follow Brussels politics closely. (See 9.52am.) Bloomberg’s Rob Hutton is not convinced by the latest Fox/Number 10 argument. Fox said it would be “self-defeating” for the UK to lower food safety standards after Brexit. He said: I have said repeatedly that we will not reduce our standards as we move forward ... There’s a trading reason why we shouldn’t want to change our standards, and that’s because of the impact on our exporters. Barclays did a big global survey of consumers about a year ago now and it showed that 59% of Chinese consumers, about 60% of Indian consumers, would pay more for the same product if they knew it came from the United Kingdom. Why? Because you put that little union flag on it and and it’s regarded as a sign of quality. We can’t compete globally at the low-cost, low-quality end of the market. We have too many fixed cost in our economy. We need therefore to compete at the high-quality end of the market. And therefore the maintenance of our high standards is part of that guaranteed quality in the goods that we export. It would be self-defeating to see us reduce our standards. There’s no advantage from a trading perspective in doing so. But Fox also refused to say the UK should continue to ban US imports of chlorine-washed chicken after Brexit, saying the use of this practice was an animal welfare issue, not a food safety issue. Chlorine-washed chicken was safe to eat, he argued. David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, was not impressed by Fox’s answer on this. Lone parents and their children have lost challenges against the government’s benefit cap at the UK’s highest court, the Press Association reports. Supreme court justices, sitting in London on Wednesday, rejected the appeals in cases brought against the work and pensions secretary over the lawfulness of the measure by a majority of five to two. This is what David Macdonald is saying about why he has abandoned Change UK, despite being their lead candidate in Scotland for the European elections, and is now backing the Lib Dems. (See 10.36am.) [After a] great deal of reflection on the political landscape we are facing in Scotland at present, I have come to the point where I have realised I must do what is best for the future of this country before anything else. If things continue as they are the remain vote will split in Scotland and put at risk the representation that supporters of remaining in the European Union so collectively desire. For that reason I have decided to end my candidacy for Change UK effective immediately and I am now calling for those in favour of remaining in the European Union, including all supporters of Change UK in Scotland, to do what is best for our collective voice in Europe and to support the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the upcoming European election, to better ensure that they gain representation to secure a seat in these European elections. The lead candidate for Change UK in Scotland’s European parliament contest has switched sides to the Liberal Democrats, in further signs the new party is struggling to consolidate itself or spread successfully across the UK. David Macdonald, an independent councillor in the wealthy district of East Renfrewshire near Glasgow, is expected to confirm shortly he has resigned from Change UK in a joint appearance with Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, near Holyrood. The Scottish Lib Dems said Macdonald will “endorse the Liberal Democrats as the party of remain.” Macdonald, a restaurateur, appears to have deleted his Change UK election Twitter account @davidchangeuk. Change UK have made negligible impact in Scotland, and his defection will likely quash any suggestions it will greatly affect the results on May 23. It has been planning to stage its first and only European elections rally in Edinburgh this Saturday but no venue has been announced. Rennie will hope Macdonald’s switch will boost the Lib Dems’ chances in the election. A recent YouGov poll for the Times put Change UK neck and neck with the Lib Dems in Scotland at 6% each, although there is little expectation the Lib Dems are popular enough to win one of the six Scottish seats on offer. Nikki da Costa, who used to work as director of legislative affairs for Theresa May at Number 10, says if the EU withdrawal agreement bill does get through its second reading, the government will have to accept whatever amendments get added. Q: The US has published their objectives for a trade deal with the UK. They want the UK to relax EU-style food standards. Are you happy with that? Fox says he has said until he is “blue in the face” that the UK will not reduce its standards after Brexit. It has legislation that protects food standards. That will not change. And there are trading reasons for this too. A Barclays survey shows that a majority of Indian and Chinese consumers would pay more for British produce, because they see it as high quality. The UK cannot compete on low standards. There would be no advantage lowering standards. Fox says lowering food standards after Brexit would be bad for UK exports. Q: What about chlorine-washed chicken? Fox says that is a different argument. That is about animal welfare, not food safety. From the BBC’s Norman Smith The WAB is the EU withdrawal agreement bill. It is said to be half an inch thick, which makes it an enormous piece of legislation, which explains Smith’s joke about “light reading”. Q: What would be an acceptable result in the European elections? And would you consider voting for the Brexit party in the Euros? Fox says he will be voting for the Conservatives, for various reasons. MEPs will have to deal with a range of issues, he says. He says the Brexit party is a single issue party. And anything that weakens the Conservatives is good for Jeremy Corbyn, he says. On expectations, he says he is a former Tory chairman. Anything he said on this would be expectation management, or evasive. And he says the question has reminded him to send in his postal vote today. Q: There seems to be little chance of the government winning the Brexit vote in June. So is this just a last throw of the dice? And if Theresa May loses, will she has to stand down? Fox says MPs will have to decide whether they want to take the UK down a path that would lead to either a no-deal Brexit, or article 50 being revoked. MPs will have to take that decision. Fox says UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs do not vote for Theresa May’s deal in June. This is also the line being briefed by Number 10. (See 9.52am.) UPDATE: Here is the quote. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is now taking questions at the Institute for Government. Q: Your department deals with trade deals outside the EU. But the central trade deal will be with the EU, and your department is not involved in those talks. When will you get involved. Fox says talks are currently going on about how to create a “single architecture”, so that there is not a divergence between the trade regime with the EU and the trade regime with the rest of the world. Q: What if the UK stays in the customs union? Fox says he does not want to see the UK stay in a customs union. He says other countries would not want to sign trade deals with the UK if it were in a temporary customs union with the EU, and they did not know when it was going to end. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, was on the Today programme this morning. He said that he was a “hardliner” on Brexit. But he insisted that the Lib Dems were not blocking progress on the Brexit legislation. They would be happy to vote for the deal, provided it was subject to a confirmatory referendum, he said. He also said that he thought three options should be put to the public in the referendum: the deal, a no-deal Brexit and remain. According to the BBC’s Norman Smith, Number 10 is now arguing that, if Theresa May’s Brexit plan gets defeated in early June, the UK will face either a no-deal Brexit at the end of October or article 50 being revoked. This argument is based on the assumption that the EU would not agree to a further extension of article 50. But EU leaders have never said that explicitly, and the conventional wisdom in Brussels is that a further extension, although not guaranteed, is certainly very possible. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has just published a very good paper addressing exactly this question. Here is an extract. EU officials don’t trust British MPs to prevent no deal and some of them think it could happen by accident. For example, what if a Boris Johnson-type figure became prime minister in October, and he or she was determined to leave without a deal? That person would refuse to ask for an extension and Parliament would not have time to bring down the government and prevent no deal before October 31st (to which the counter-argument is that no prime minister committed to a no deal Brexit could ever win a parliamentary majority for forming a government in the first place). Some senior figures in Brussels expect the British to receive an extension till June 2020. That is the latest possible date for the EU to agree on its next seven-year budget plan, the multiannual financial framework that starts in 2021, without serious problems arising. In the long run the UK would have to go for an election or referendum or no deal – or possibly a different kind of Brexit, said one figure. But would not Macron veto further extensions? “No, he could not resist the pressure from all the others in the room to compromise.” Another official agrees that the 27 are unlikely to force the UK out by refusing a further extension, but adds that this could change if the British elected a fearsome swarm of Faragist MPs in the European elections. Similarly, a new government led by a hard-line eurosceptic committed to starting fights with the EU could lead the patience of some member-states to snap. My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels also thinks a further article 50 extension is more likely than not. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is giving a speech at the Institute for Government. There is a live feed here. He started by saying trade policy was only a relatively small part of what his department does (accounting for 20% of staff) and he is now summarising how his department promotes trade. I will post any highlights from the speech and the Q&amp;A. After weeks of procrastination, Theresa May has now announced a date - or rather, three possible dates - for what will be her final attempt to get MPs to vote for her withdrawal agreement. It will be the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and it will take place in the week beginning Monday 3 June. But the whitsun recess does not end until the following day, and so the vote will probably take place on either Tuesday 4 June, Wednesday 5 June or Thursday 6 June. Here is the Guardian’s overnight story. So May has three weeks to construct a majority. But it is not there now. Last night the Labour party made it clear that it would not support the bill unless the government strikes a deal with the party over the Brexit outcome it wants and, in a statement, Jeremy Corbyn that was still some way off. The DUP, May’s supposed confidence and supply partners, said they remained opposed to what was on offer. And the smaller opposition parties, the SNP, the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru, also expressed their continued opposition to the plan. And what about the 34 Conservative who voted against the agreement at the last debate (when other rebels had given in)? Six of them are pro-Europeans, but the rest were hardline Brexiters and one of them, Owen Paterson, told the Today programme this morning that he remained opposed to what was on offer. He said: Sadly, we will vote against it again, as the DUP put out a statement, because it doesn’t change the essential nature of the withdrawal agreement, which is unacceptable we will have laws imposed on us by 27 different countries where we are not involved. And, very importantly for the DUP and us, it potentially breaks up the United Kingdom by creating a new entity called UKNI [UK Northern Ireland] and that means you could end with Scotland wanting to follow and that is really dangerous for the union. We’ll hear from May herself at PMQs. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.05am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, gives a speech at the FT Future of the Car summit. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech at the Institute for Government. 10am: Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, gives a speech at the First Sea Lord’s Sea Power Conference. 11.10am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.30pm: Google, YouTube and Instagram give evidence to the Commons culture committee. 4pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a walkabout in Merthyr Tydfil.

The 1MW solar farm at Karratha airport, made possible by a $2.3m grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), has been fitted with state-of-the-art CloudCAM cloud-tracking technology by Fulcrum3D – a technology also backed by a separate $545,000 Arena grant. Dips in power output from solar farms that occur when clouds pass over leads some solar farms to rely on backup energy storage to smooth out the output. The unpredictability of those dips in output also makes it difficult for the operators to predict prices and can hinder their ability to bid in electricity markets. According to the manufacturers, the cloud-tracking technology allows the solar operators to reliably predict the output of the solar farm 15 minutes ahead of time, meaning they can minimise the reliance on energy storage and can more effectively take part in market bidding. The chief executive of Arena, Ivor Frischknecht, said that the technology “makes solar cheaper and reduces intermittency by giving the operators a clearer picture of the solar resource they can expect in the immediate future”. “Cloud prediction makes solar cheaper and more reliable while reducing the need for batteries,” Frischknecht said. “That’s what makes this project so exciting.” The marriage of two separate Arena-funded projects demonstrated the effectiveness of Arena grants and how they were benefiting regional communities, Frischknecht said. Frischknecht said the Karratha airport solar plant would be a good example, demonstrating why more renewables should be connected to Western Australia’s North West Interconnected System (NWIS). The NWIS supplies electricity to Karratha, Port Headland and Goldsworth, as well as areas inland from there. “The NWIS is a smaller network that requires renewable energy to meet performance criteria that are geared towards maintaining network stability,” Frischknecht said. “Arena-supported projects like the Karratha airport solar farm and CloudCAM are important for demonstrating to network owner and operator Horizon Power that solar can provide sustainable, reliable power into the NWIS without the need for large amounts of expensive battery storage,” Frischknecht said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"How sun, salt and glass could help solve our energy needs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"How sun, salt and glass could help solve our energy needs","bodyText":"High in the stark Nevada desert, a couple of hundred miles north-west of Las Vegas, is the shimmering circular mirage of Crescent Dunes. Ten thousand silvery glass panes, each measuring 115 square metres, surround a tall central tower, which stands like a twinkling needle in the featureless landscape around it. Resembling a fabulous alien metropolis, Crescent Dunes is in fact a highly sophisticated, mile-and-a-half-wide solar power plant – “the next generation in solar energy”, according to Kevin Smith, one of the project’s founders. The glass panes, which comprise a combined area of more than a million square metres, are not photovoltaic (PV) panels like those installed on rooftops and in solar farms worldwide. Instead, they are simply vast, multifaceted mirrors, which track the course of the sun like heliotropic plants. This field of mirrors harnesses and concentrates the blazing Nevada sunshine, directing it precisely towards the top of the central tower. “The difficulty with photovoltaic is that it’s intermittent,” says Smith, who is CEO of Crescent Dunes’s parent company, SolarReserve. “When the sun goes down, you’re done.” Engineers have long sought methods of storing solar energy – in water, in batteries, in fluid-filled “parabolic troughs” – but Smith claims that Crescent Dunes demonstrates “the world’s most advanced energy-storage technology”, known as molten-salt storage. The central tower secretes a reservoir of potassium and sodium nitrate – about 25,000 metric tonnes of it – heated in advance to 288°C, at which temperature the mixture is a clear, water-like liquid. This is circulated in narrow, thin-walled tubes, rising dramatically in temperature when exposed to the fearsome, concentrated sunlight at the top of the tower. “We heat it to 560°C,” says Smith, “it flows back down the tower and we capture it in a large tank.” The molten salt efficiently maintains the heat and when the energy is required, it is converted to electricity through a conventional steam turbine. This set-up allows Crescent Dunes to provide power to 75,000 Nevada homes long after the sun has set and even, if necessary, 24 hours a day.Smith believes that concentrated solar power (CSP) is not simply a substitute for photovoltaic panels but a potential competitor to conventional fuels. “It’s really an alternative to fossil fuel or even nuclear. You couldn’t power a city with just PV and wind, but you could with CSP, because of the storage capacity.” SolarReserve is already developing cheaper, higher-capacity installations and planning to build similar solar plants in South Africa, Chile and China. Of course, the technology isn’t flawless: CSP can only efficiently operate in areas with intense, uninterrupted sunlight and birds can be burned and killed by the concentrated sunbeams. Nonetheless, Crescent Dunes emits no pollutants, uses a fraction of the water required to generate coal or nuclear power and occupies a smaller combined area than, say, a coal-fired power station. Assuming the technology proves sustainable and replicable, among the ancient mountains of the American west, a bright future may be under way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/31/rapid-decline-of-coal-use-leads-to-drop-in-uk-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-31T10:45:36Z","webTitle":"Rapid decline of coal use leads to drop in UK emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/31/rapid-decline-of-coal-use-leads-to-drop-in-uk-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/31/rapid-decline-of-coal-use-leads-to-drop-in-uk-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Rapid decline of coal use leads to drop in UK emissions","bodyText":"Plummeting coal use in 2015 led to a fall of 4% in the UK’s annual carbon dioxide emissions, according to government energy statistics published on Thursday. Coal is now burning at its lowest level in at least 150 years. The closing of old polluting coal-power stations and the rapid rise in renewable energy meant coal consumption fell by 22% compared to 2014, the biggest drop ever seen outside of miners’ strikes, according to analysts at Carbon Brief. Production of coal in the UK also fell to a new record low, dropping by 27% due to mines closing. The rapid decline in coal use is continuing in 2016, with four more stations closed in the last fortnight, including Longannet, Ferrybridge and Eggborough, leaving six operational. The government has pledged to close all coal plants by 2025 to help meet climate change targets. The future of the large new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is also in serious doubt, leading to concerns about energy security. But experts said coal plant closures would not lead to the lights going out. “We have seen at least five years of “lights out” headlines, so far without so much as a flicker caused by insufficient capacity,” said Prof Michael Grubb, at University College London. “Despite tight margins, extreme weather is far more likely to cause any household disconnections than insufficient generating capacity.” “Closure of these coal plants is both expected and necessary,” said Jonathan Gaventa, director of thinktank E3G. “The UK has plenty of options to cover the loss of coal-fired power through energy efficiency, renewables, interconnection with other countries and smart demand. This combination can deliver low-cost electricity reliably and quickly.” Renewable electricity generation surged in 2015, rising by 29%, allowing it to claim a record 25% share of all electricity. Most of this came from wind power and bioenergy, the latter being boosted by the continued conversion of Drax - once the UK’s biggest coal plant - to burning wood pellets. Solar power increased by 50% in 2015 to make up 9% of all renewable electricity. The government has been repeatedly criticised for cutting support for renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. “If anything is to blame for tight margins, it’s previous governments’ history of incoherent energy policy,” said Paul Massara, former CEO of “big six” energy company RWE npower. “Investors need long-term clarity on policy, and they simply have not been getting it.” “Look outside the UK and it’s clear that the direction of travel in is only in one direction, towards primarily low-carbon, flexible, smart energy systems,” said Andrew Garrad, senior consultant at DNV GL energy. “It’s been accelerated by the Paris climate agreement, and Britain is by no means ahead of the pack in this transition.” The share of electricity generated by gas remained unchanged at 30% while nuclear’s share rose by two percentage points to 21%. The energy used by transport rose, which the government said was probably due to lower petrol prices. Oil production in the UK was 13% higher than in 2014 and gas production 8% higher, both bucking the trend of steady decline seen since the peaks seen in 1999 and 2000 respectively. The UK is the only G7 country increasing fossil fuel subsidies, according to a report in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/27/coal-power-plan-twice-the-cost-of-renewables-route-emissions-reduction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-27T03:15:03Z","webTitle":"Australia's coal power plan twice as costly as renewables route, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/27/coal-power-plan-twice-the-cost-of-renewables-route-emissions-reduction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/27/coal-power-plan-twice-the-cost-of-renewables-route-emissions-reduction","fields":{"headline":"Australia's coal power plan twice as costly as renewables route, report finds","bodyText":"A plan for new coal power plants, which government ministers say could reduce emissions from coal-generated electricity by 27%, would cost more than $60bn, a new analysis has found. Achieving the same reduction using only renewable energy would cost just half as much – between $24bn and $34bn – the report found. The resources minister, Matthew Canavan, and the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, have been arguing for new coal power plants to be built in Australia. Last week, Canavan released analysis he commissioned from the industry department, which found replacing all Australia’s coal power stations with the latest “ultra super-critical” coal-fired power stations would reduce emissions in that sector by 27%. Frydenberg has also raised the conclusions in interviews, and promoted the benefits of coal power. Neither has responded to questions about the cost of reducing coal-fired power emissions by 27% using the latest technology. So Dylan McConnell from the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne crunched the numbers, and found that the 27% reduction in the coal sector could be achieved, but it would cost $62bn. McConnell said at a conservative estimate, achieving the reduction would require 20GW of new capacity. According to the latest estimates from the CSIRO, new ultra super-critical black coal costs $3,100 per kW to build. “No wonder no one wants to talk about the costs,” McConnell said. He said $62bn would be enough to build between 35GW and 39GW of wind and solar energy. Because that would produce less electricity than 20GW of coal power, it would not completely replace coal power, but it would reduce its emissions by up to 65%. And that would amount to an emissions reduction of between 50% and 60% in the electricity sector as a whole. McConnell found that if the 27% reduction in emissions from the coal generation sector were to be achieved with renewables, rather than with new coal, about 13-19GW of renewable energy would be needed, which would cost between $24bn and $34bn. He said the scenario proposed by Canavan and Frydenberg would end up with 20GW of highly polluting coal power stations that were unlikely to be retired for decades. On the other hand, McConnell said, if that money were spent on renewables, it would leave some coal and gas in place, which ultimately would still need to be removed to meet long-term emissions reduction targets. Neither Canavan nor Frydenberg responded to questions about the costs of building new coal power stations. In a statement, Frydenberg said only that the government was committed to a “technology neutral” approach to meeting emissions targets. “Arbitrarily excluding certain technologies for ideological reasons will lead to higher cost outcomes,” the statement said. The Opposition spokesman for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, said: “This analysis clearly shows the government is off on an economically and environmentally irresponsible frolic with their trumpeting of ‘clean coal’. “As the Australian Industry Group and many others have made clear, replacing our existing coal power with more coal power just doesn’t stack up; either on environmental or economic grounds. “This is just the latest effort of a weak government to appease its irrational extreme right wing and distract from the fact they’re simply incapable of delivering real policy solutions to our significant energy challenges,” Butler said. McConnell pointed out that the latest coal-powered fire stations were not at all “clean”. They produced about 700 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of electricity – much more than the 400 grams from new combined cycle gas turbines, and much more than the average produced by OECD countries, 420 grams per kilowatt hour in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. OECD countries will need to reduce that figure to just 15 grams per kilowatt hour if the world is to keep global temperature increases below 2C, the agency has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/24/us-scientists-launch-worlds-biggest-solar-geoengineering-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T12:39:33Z","webTitle":"US scientists launch world's biggest solar geoengineering study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/24/us-scientists-launch-worlds-biggest-solar-geoengineering-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/24/us-scientists-launch-worlds-biggest-solar-geoengineering-study","fields":{"headline":"US scientists launch world's biggest solar geoengineering study","bodyText":"US scientists are set to send aerosol injections 20km up into the earth’s stratosphere in the world’s biggest solar geoengineering programme to date, to study the potential of a future tech-fix for global warming. The $20m (£16m) Harvard University project will launch within weeks and aims to establish whether the technology can safely simulate the atmospheric cooling effects of a volcanic eruption, if a last ditch bid to halt climate change is one day needed. Scientists hope to complete two small-scale dispersals of first water and then calcium carbonate particles by 2022. Future tests could involve seeding the sky with aluminium oxide – or even diamonds. “This is not the first or the only university study,” said Gernot Wagner, the project’s co-founder, “but it is most certainly the largest, and the most comprehensive.” Janos Pasztor, Ban Ki-moon’s assistant climate chief at the UN who now leads a geoengineering governance initiative, said that the Harvard scientists would only disperse minimal amounts of compounds in their tests, under strict university controls. “The real issue here is something much more challenging,” he said “What does moving experimentation from the lab into the atmosphere mean for the overall path towards eventual deployment?” Geoengineering advocates stress that any attempt at a solar tech fix is years away and should be viewed as a complement to – not a substitute for – aggressive emissions reductions action. But the Harvard team, in a promotional video for the project, suggest a redirection of one percent of current climate mitigation funds to geoengineering research, and argue that the planet could be covered with a solar shield for as little as $10bn a year. Some senior UN climate scientists view such developments with alarm, fearing a cash drain from proven mitigation technologies such as wind and solar energy, to ones carrying the potential for unintended disasters. Kevin Trenberth, a lead author for the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said that despair at sluggish climate action, and the rise of Donald Trump were feeding the current tech trend. “But solar geoengineering is not the answer,” he said. “Cutting incoming solar radiation affects the weather and hydrological cycle. It promotes drought. It destabilizes things and could cause wars. The side effects are many and our models are just not good enough to predict the outcomes” Natural alterations to the earth’s radiation balance can be short-lasting, but terrifying. A 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption lowered global temperatures by 0.5C, while the Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 triggered Europe’s ‘year without a summer’, bringing crop failure, famine and disease. A Met Office study in 2013 said that the dispersal of fine particles in the stratosphere could precipitate a calamitous drought across North Africa. Frank Keutsch, the Harvard atmospheric sciences professor leading the experiment, said that the deployment of a solar geoengineering system was “a terrifying prospect” that he hoped would never have to be considered. “At the same time, we should never choose ignorance over knowledge in a situation like this,” he said. “If you put heat into the stratosphere, it may change how much water gets transported from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and the question is how much are you [creating] a domino effect with all kinds of consequences? What we can do to quantify this is to start with lab studies and try to understand the relevant properties of these aerosols.” Stratospheric controlled perturbation experiments (SCoPEX) are seen as “critical” to this process and the first is planned to spray water molecules into the stratosphere to create a 1km long and 100m wide icy plume, which can be studied by a manoeuvrable flight balloon. If lab tests are positive, the experiment would then be replicated with a limestone compound which the researchers believe will neither absorb solar or terrestrial radiation, nor deplete the ozone layer. Bill Gates and other foundations are substantially funding the project, and aerospace companies are thought to be taking a business interest in the technology’s potential. The programmme’s launch will follow a major conference involving more than 100 scientists, which begins in Washington DC today. Solar geoengineering’s journey from the fringes of climate science to its mainstream will be sealed at a prestigious Gordon research conference in July, featuring senior figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Oxford University. Pasztor says that most scientific observers now see the window to a 1.5C warmed world as “practically gone” and notes that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will continue rising for many decades after the planet has reached a ‘net zero emissions’ point planned for mid-late century. But critics of solar radiation management approach this as a call to redouble mitigation efforts and guard against the elevation of a questionable Plan B. “It is appropriate that we spend money on solar geoengineering research,” said Kevin Anderson, the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. “But we also have to aim for 2C with climate mitigation and act as though geoengineering doesn’t work, because it probably won’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/24/hottest-year-ever-but-no-mention-of-climate-change-by-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-24T18:56:44Z","webTitle":"Hottest year ever – but no mention of climate change by Hammond | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/24/hottest-year-ever-but-no-mention-of-climate-change-by-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/24/hottest-year-ever-but-no-mention-of-climate-change-by-hammond","fields":{"headline":"Hottest year ever – but no mention of climate change by Hammond","bodyText":"It is staggering that in 2016, the hottest year on record, the chancellor can present a budget that has no mention of climate change (Report, 24 November). Indeed, most policies and spending plans are heading in the wrong direction.

The freeze on fuel duty is another backward step and shows that the government cares nothing about climate change, air pollution or public health. Last year saw a record number of vehicles on our roads, especially in rural areas where bus services have been decimated. The government could bring us healthier air and less congestion by raising fuel duty and using the money to reverse the devastating cuts to buses.

A carbon tax is gaining favour with governments and economists worldwide. Ironically, if – as it appears – a tax is not in our immediate future, other countries could slap one on our exports. Then we might reconsider a fee-and-dividend to improve our own economy, environment, and public health rather than pay someone else’s tax. In any case progress will come, as it already has, from states, local jurisdictions, and the private sector because reducing emissions makes economic sense. Washington can at most help, or at least stay out of the way. China has a major role in this drama. It has taken praiseworthy steps to reduce its carbon emissions. It is a leading exporter of wind turbines, and its technology has made solar energy affordable worldwide. Now it hopes to wrest the mantle of climate leadership from America. You want to compete with China, Mr Trump? Then compete to save the climate. Denying reality, trashing the environment, rushing headlong toward climate catastrophe, and withdrawing from the global community won’t make America great. Our spirits, but not our resolve, may have hit rock bottom on 9 November; but mine have rebounded. We can lick this. The question is, will it be in time?

While the Palaszczuk government was determined to drive Queensland’s transformation from Australia’s biggest carbon polluter to a zero net emitter by 2050, it would rely for now on the economics of renewable energy and the “goodwill and leadership of industry” where national political leaders had failed, she said. Trad also said it would be “ridiculous” for the government to promise to stop the contentious Adani mine, given the company had stuck to legislative requirements and prevailed against a string of legal challenges. But she said Adani’s “whole future” was tied to what happened in India’s energy market, where solar power recently came in cheaper than coal-fired power. Speaking in the wake of meetings with Al Gore, who last week said it was “just nuts” to contemplate government funding for Adani’s mine infrastructure, Trad said the former US vice president turned climate action advocate had not broached the topic with her. “But we acknowledge that we need to work on transitioning our economy, and one of the things that we need to understand and know is that the global thermal coal markets will change, they will fluctuate, but they are on a general trajectory downwards in terms of relying on coal,” Trad told Guardian Australia. While there was “overwhelming support” in Queensland for climate action, there was also public demand for a “just transition” in the economy that took account of the importance of resource sector jobs. “This is an enormous challenge and Queensland does emit a lot of carbon emissions, carbon pollution,” Trad said. The state government has vowed to restore tree clearing protections if it wins the next election, something it could not do in minority government. Trad said this was “without a doubt” the least costly way of making deep cuts in Queensland’s carbon emissions, which accounted for 28.3% of the national total in 2015, more than any other state. “Yes, there will be people who don’t want to see their property rights reduced and they want to do what they want to do on their properties,” she said. “But the time is now for us to understand that there is a significant imperative that goes well beyond the boundary fence of any one property. “And quite frankly … a lot of the land clearing that’s happened has happened in Great Barrier Reef catchments [and] if we want to create a resilient reef we’ve got to reduce the amount of rubbish that is flowing into the reef.” Conservation groups welcomed the government’s 2050 zero net emissions target, announced last week as part of its climate change transition and adaptation strategies, but noted it was light on detail about how it would be achieved. Carbon cuts through tree clearing protections and a shift to 50% renewable energy by 2030 – the latter reducing total emissions by 30% – would account for less than half Queensland’s current carbon pollution. Tim Seelig of the Queensland Conservation Council said the government would have to start talking about winding down coal-fired generation or thermal coal mines within the next few years. “Ultimately, it’s hard to see how they can get there otherwise,” Seelig said. Trad said the 2030 target was an interim goal that the government’s advisory panel said did not require coal plant closures. “We haven’t talked about retiring any of our coal-fired fleet because ... Queensland’s fleet is actually quite young in terms of our power generation,” she said. It made sense in a national energy market for “the older, dirtier fleets to be retired and then work your way through and then the economy and the energy generation grid is changing, which it is doing at quite a rapid rate”. “But clearly [coal plant closures] will be an ongoing discussion in Queensland, in the national community and the local community, because we do know that in the global energy market, investment in renewable energy generation is skyrocketing.” A key takeout from her “inspirational and energising” encounters with Gore – during which Queensland signed up with other states to a “climate leadership declaration” – was his observation on “exponential” jobs growth in renewables in the US. “There is a trend happening and it is our obligation as a state government to make sure that we identify this trend because not only is it important for our planet in terms of keeping global temperatures below that 2C threshold, but also in terms of making sure that our economy transitions in a just way and we get the industry and the jobs,” she said. “That’s the sustainable economy that we need to prepare for. If we don’t prepare for it, we won’t get it.” Since the government set its clean energy target when coming to office, more than $2bn had been invested in large scale renewable energy, Trad said. Trad said in the absence of a national price signal on carbon, state governments trying to fill “a void” in political leadership were “relying on, number one, the economics of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper all the time”. “We’ve seen in places like India for example, the price of solar renewable energy generation dropped, significantly, below coal-fired generation power,” she said. “It’s that sort of economic imperative for industry, consumers and large scale corporations that are going to drive investment. “That’s what we’re relying on, that and the goodwill and leadership of industry to play a role where ... political leaders have failed. “I go to boardroom lunches and industry is preparing for it. They actually understand there is a significant trend happening globally and that if they don’t have a business plan and an idea about how they going to incorporate some sort of carbon price-type of solution, then they will be left short. “We know that Malcolm Turnbull is showing no leadership on this, that he is dithering in a deeply divided party room around action on climate change. “While he’s doing that, states and territories are getting on with the job of setting targets, working through plans, implementing policies that are actually going to make a difference.” The Palaszczuk government, in its attempts to contrast its environmental credentials with the Liberal National party opposition, has often come under criticism for its public support of Adani’s Carmichael mine. While Australia’s largest proposed thermal coal mine is a lightning rod for the conservation movement, which decries it as a “carbon bomb” to be exported to Asia, the Queensland government has been loath to stand in the way of a project promising almost 1,500 net jobs in a regional mining downturn. Trad said that “to be clear we never went to the election saying we were going to stop Adani – that would be ridiculous”. “But what we do know is that we need to find the resource sector jobs of the future. That’s what people want us to do.” But Trad said the contrast of Labor’s handling of the project with the former LNP government was obvious. “What Campbell Newman was going to do was give them $500m for their railway, and give them a royalty holiday, and dump 3m cubic metres of dredge spoil on the Great Barrier Reef. Asked whether the government could stop Adani if it wanted to, Trad said the company had “applied for mining licences under our legislation and it’s been appealed in several courts now and nothing’s been upheld”. “So that is what it is.” Trad said the “whole future of Adani is actually 100% leaning to what India does in terms of its energy generations of the future”. “The cost of solar energy in India actually came in at much less than coal-fired energy recently when they put out the auction. “That’s the stuff that’s happening because technology has improved. This is the stuff that’s going to change the global energy market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/04/denmark-josh-frydenberg-wind-energy-potential-qanda","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T21:03:12Z","webTitle":"We can't be Denmark: Josh Frydenberg plays down wind energy potential on Q&A","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/04/denmark-josh-frydenberg-wind-energy-potential-qanda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/04/denmark-josh-frydenberg-wind-energy-potential-qanda","fields":{"headline":"We can't be Denmark: Josh Frydenberg plays down wind energy potential on Q&A","bodyText":"Josh Frydenberg has pointed to South Australia’s intermittent power issues as evidence that the rest of the country is not ready to transition out of fossil fuels, calling the state Australia’s “great experiment”. The minister for the environment and energy appeared alongside Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the chief executive of Save the Children International and the former prime minister of Denmark, on the Q&amp;A panel on Monday night. Denmark derives 57% of its electricity from renewable sources – 43% from wind. Asked whether Australia could reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, Frydenberg said the transition was under way. He said there was no shortage of wind or sun in Australia but its geographical remoteness meant it could not be connected to other countries in the way Denmark was. He said producing similar figures for wind for Australia was “probably not going to be when I’m the energy minister, but it will be in time very high levels of renewable penetration into the grid”. Frydenberg pointed to South Australia as evidence of how far renewable sources had to go before they could be relied upon. “They’ve been the big experiment, not just in Australia, but for much of the world. “One of the challenges they’ve faced is on one day wind has provided 100% of the power for SA and on another day 0%. That’s a level of intermittency which is very hard to deal with … so it’s an engineering challenge.” Thorning-Schmidt agreed that a “good mix” of energies was crucial for easing the transition to renewables, but said it took a “big, conscious effort” for Denmark to get to that stage. “If you think it through in a good way, it is possible. It does require investment. And often investment will require political will.” Labor’s human services spokeswoman, Linda Burney, agreed political will was lacking. She was scathing about the treasurer Scott Morrison’s coal stunt in parliament, calling it “one of the most ridiculous things” she had seen since becoming an MP. “It seems like it’s almost back to the future and coal is king again. And it was pure politics.” Paul Kelly, the editor-at-large of the Australian, said investors would be put off the renewables sector while opposing parties had such different policies on the issue. “We’ve got to make the transition in terms of emission reductions, according to our commitments under the Paris accords. We have to try and do it in a way that doesn’t do too much damage to the economy … and we’ve got to ensure the system doesn’t falter, that we don’t have the sort of blackouts which we’ve been having in South Australia.” But politicking and investment aside, Thorning-Schmidt argued, the transition had to happen because of the threat of climate change. “Climate change is actually real. It’s happening … We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of refugees as it is; we will have to add to that climate refugees. So I don’t think any of us can back out of this discussion. “This is a real issue and no one can solve this alone. But every country can play its part.” Asked by the host, Tony Jones, whether she was making an argument against coal, she replied: “Renewable energy is not coal.” Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi Nobel peace laureate and micro-financing pioneer, echoed Thorning-Schmidt when he said Australia’s transition from fossil fuels depended on “the strength of the commitment” to renewables. “That determines everything else. If you’re not quite sure how far we want to go, how quickly we want to go, then we’ll never get there. It has to be very clear this is what we’ll do: we’ll forget about fossil fuels and everything else.” Once the objective was clear, he said, the necessary technology would follow, pointing to the uptake of solar energy in Bangladesh. Yunus founded the grassroots Grameen Bank, which has 9 million borrowers, to combat poverty through micro-loans. He said growing inequality in wealth distribution was “a ticking time bomb”, linking it to Brexit in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US. “One per cent of the population of the whole world own 99% of the wealth of the entire world … That’s not sustainable society. You can’t watch people get everything on the top and everyone else is not getting anything. The feeling passes on to politics, passes on to society, and now our politics is blaming each other.” Thorning-Schmidt criticised Australia’s foreign aid contribution as inadequate in response to Frydenberg’s argument it was the 12th-highest of OECD countries. “I’m a foreigner and I shouldn’t be telling Australia what Australia should be doing,” she said. “I know how annoying it is when someone comes in and raises their finger. “The only thing I can say is when your development budget is at an all-time low, which it is right now, it feels like Australia is not taking its place in the world.” In response, Frydenberg accused the former foreign minister Kevin Rudd of acting with “ulterior motives” in directing Australia’s foreign aid towards Africa. He said the budget had not been reduced but “refocused” towards the Pacific. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was committed to exploring partnerships with the private sector, he said. Frydenberg was invited to be a panellist at the last minute, after the cancellation of the anti-Islam activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s lecture tour of Australia. She cited a number of reasons, among them “organisational failures” by the Australian company behind the tour and “security concerns”. The energy minister said it was “very regrettable” that people had sought to prevent her from speaking in Australia, and linked her views to the debate about the 18C legislation: “I see her as the enemy of intolerance … I think we must protect and promote freedom of speech.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/27/better-election-results-ahead-for-the-green-party","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-27T20:05:25Z","webTitle":"Better election results ahead for the Green party? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/27/better-election-results-ahead-for-the-green-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/27/better-election-results-ahead-for-the-green-party","fields":{"headline":"Better election results ahead for the Green party?","bodyText":"Both John Curtice (Remain voters must now be Corbyn’s top priority, 25 February) and Jonathan Freedland (Copeland shows that Corbyn must go. But only Labour’s left can remove him, 25 February) suggest that Labour’s only hope is to champion the 48% – or, to put it more accurately, the 63% who did not vote to leave the EU. But Jeremy Corbyn has already blown that one with his tragically misguided three-line whip to crawl after the Tories in voting for article 50, even though most Labour voters backed Remain, as did most Greens and most Liberal Democrats. Labour’s last hope of avoiding electoral oblivion is to champion proportional representation, as Martin Childs says (Letters, 25 February). No one can really say what motivated a slim majority of voters to go for leave, but the most convincing argument that covers all possible shades of opinion is that people did not feel listened to. This isn’t necessarily the same as feeling “left behind”. I am not one of the left behind, but as a Green voter I am hugely underrepresented in parliament and my issues and concerns are routinely dismissed and ignored. I am definitely not listened to. Proportional representation would give a proper voice to me and to everyone else in the country who feels let down or marginalised. In fact, had we had PR in place prior to the referendum, it is almost certain that far fewer people would have felt motivated to give the government and/or the elite a kicking. Claire Lewis London • Reading John Curtice’s article confirms me in the belief that Labour’s electoral strategy appears to be “win Stoke and lose London”. In 2020 Labour remainers such as myself will have three unenviable options: either voting reluctantly for Labour, a party determined to ignore our views, despite us being in the majority among Labour voters; voting Green; or abstaining. Given Labour’s poor polling figures, it does seem a misguided strategy to alienate the majority of Labour voters. Derrick Joad Leeds • Re your editorial (Labour needs better answers to the questions voters are asking, 25 February), I would have expected better of the Guardian than to refer to “England’s four main parties (five if you count the Greens)”. The Green party is not the fifth party of British politics; it has been around since 1972, unlike Ukip, which only began in 1991 and which after Stoke and Copeland looks like it has had its day. Unlike Ukip, the Greens have an MP elected on a Green ticket rather than originally by defection from the Tories. Unlike the SNP or Plaid Cymru, the Greens cover the whole of the UK. In the 2016 London elections the Greens were the third party, on first- and second-preference votes, ahead of both the Lib Dems and Ukip. A major factor behind Sarah Olney’s Richmond Park victory was that she benefited from the Green vote, following an agreement to do politics differently and work in partnership for that particular vote. And, as the Guardian itself reported in January 2015, Green party membership was growing faster than that of the Lib Dems or Ukip. That growth has continued and, unlike Ukip, the Labour party or even the Tories, the Green party has a leadership that has its party behind it, with a coherent political vision, for a sustainable, fairer and greener society. Catherine Shelley Croydon and Sutton Green party • After a byelection, all I need is the result now and the result at the last election. I am capable of doing the sums of who is doing better or worse. As a Green councillor I am particularly interested if the Green vote is going up or down. The Guardian on 25 February was no help. Roger Stearn Old Newton, Suffolk • You used to give much more useful information in your byelection results: the votes cast and percentage for each candidate and the overall swing, plus the previous election figures for comparison. Why not revert to that approach rather than the fairly useless graphic which takes about the same amount of space while giving far less information. Joseph Webber Haywards Heath, West Sussex • Copeland voters are most worried about jobs; their main employer is the nuclear industry. They could see it had no future when a Chinese company stopped negotiations for a local buyout. That deal would have been bad for our energy bill payers because we would have had no control over pricing such electricity, but it was the last hope of a government that will not commit another penny to Sellafield. Labour’s mistake was ignoring the job opportunities to replace that industry such as wind and tidal power, solar energy, heat extraction and better use of methane. Also the thousands of long-term jobs needed to decommission such plants. The nuclear industry is paid for by taxation, but all that public money is only going in one direction, preventing “green economic growth”. Private investment follows public money into industry. Present policy stops such progress.

Narendra Modi told a press conference that as fossil fuels put the planet in peril, hopes for future prosperity in the developing world now rest on bold initiatives. “Solar technology is evolving, costs are coming down and grid connectivity is improving,” he said. “The dream of universal access to clean energy is becoming more real. This will be the foundation of the new economy of the new century.” Modi described the solar alliance as “the sunrise of new hope, not just for clean energy but for villages and homes still in darkness, for mornings and evening filled with a clear view of the glory of the sun”. Earlier, France’s climate change ambassador, Laurence Tubiana, had called the group “a true game-changer”. While signatory nations mostly hail from the tropics, several European countries are also on board with the initiative, including France. Hollande described the project as climate justice in action, mobilising public finance from richer states to help deliver universal energy access. “What we are putting in place is an avant garde of countries that believe in renewable energies,” he told a press conference in Paris. “What we are showing here is an illustration of the future Paris accord, as this initiative gives meaning to sharing technology and mobilising financial resources in an example of what we wish to do in the course of the climate conference.” The Indian government is investing an initial $30m (£20m) in setting up the alliance’s headquarters in India. The eventual goal is to raise $400m from membership fees, and international agencies. Companies involved in the project include Areva, Engie, Enel, HSBC France and Tata Steel. “It is very, very exciting to see India nailing its colours to the mast and providing leadership on this issue,” said James Watson, the director of SolarPower Europe, which represents the continents’ solar photovoltaic industry. “It will mean more opportunities for solar across the world and that can only be positive for combating climate change.” The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, placed the initiative in the context of the body’s sustainable development goals, particularly a related target, set in 2011, of achieving universal access to sustainable energy by 2030. India has repeatedly said that it wants to use cheap solar to connect citizens who are currently without access to the electricity grid in remote and rural areas. “The idea is that larger markets and bigger volumes will lead to lower costs, making it possible to spur demand,” said Ajay Mathur, India’s senior negotiator and spokesperson at the Paris summit. “This bold effort could bring affordable solar power to tropical villages and communities worldwide,” said Jennifer Morgan, the director of the World Research Institute’s climate programme. India’s pledge to the Paris summit offered to draw 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. The country is projected to be the world’s most populous by then, with 1.45 billion people. Climate Action Tracker described the promise as being “at the least ambitious end of what would be a fair contribution”, and not consistent with meeting a 2C target. But some see Modi as a clean energy enabler, having rapidly rolled out more than 900MW of solar energy across Gujarat when he was chief minister there. “India has emerged as the natural leader for this alliance, with its ambitious targets to install 175GW of renewable energy by 2022,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council for Energy, Environment and Water in India. Modi’s announcement on Monday comes hot on the heels of a pledge by the US and 18 other countries to provide $20bn for clean energy research by 2020, a doubling of current funding commitments. A separate Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which will act as an investment platform for clean energy projects, is also being launched on Monday by Bill Gates and the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. On Sunday, Dubai announced a Dh100bn ($27bn) programme to make solar panels mandatory for all rooftop buildings by 2030, part of a plan to make the city a global clean energy centre. Dubai aims to generate 25% of its energy from clean sources by 2030, rising to 75% by 2050. The Indian initiative, called the International Agency for Solar Technologies and Applications (Iasta), aims to spread cheap solar technology across the globe with pooled policy knowledge. “We share a collective ambition to undertake innovative and concerted efforts aimed at reducing the costs of financing and urgent technological deployment for competitive solar facilities throughout our country,” a membership statement by the alliance says. It adds that the alliance will “pave the way for production technologies and storage of solar energy, adapted to the specific needs of our country”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-05T07:00:33Z","webTitle":"Offshore wind, clever concrete and fake meat: the top climate change innovations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat","fields":{"headline":"Offshore wind, clever concrete and fake meat: the top climate change innovations","bodyText":"People in the US and beyond concerned about climate change may be alarmed at the Trump administration’s policies and attitudes – but there are plenty of businesses and innovators doing work at various scales. From solar to fake meat and low-carbon concrete, Oliver Milman explores some of the best examples of climate change-tackling innovations and innovators. Community solar Large-scale solar is a booming industry in the US, with the sector now employing twice the number of people involved with coal mining. But the decarbonization of America’s energy system is happening at a more local level, too. There are 25 states with at least one community solar project online, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and 2016 was a bumper year, with 218 MW added. “It’s picking up speed, and there’s a lot in the pipeline, so it’ll be a mainstream driver of solar in the future,” said Alex Hobson, a spokeswoman for the association. “There is room to grow and there’s a lot of interest from people who never thought about solar, such as those renting or who are moving out of their buildings in the near future.” Community solar works by allowing several people, such as those in a building with several apartments, to derive energy from a solar project installed on their building or elsewhere. Some utilities provide customers the ability to purchase the renewable energy from a shared facility, while in other cases groups of people band together to take advantage of state and federal incentives to make the investment themselves. California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota are currently leading the way. Vegetarian meat Agricultural activities currently contribute about 10% of America’s total greenhouse gas emissions each year, largely due to the methane expelled by cattle. Americans are eating less beef than they did a decade ago, but further reductions would be handy if the US is to reduce its emissions to levels that would help avoid dangerous climate change. A raft of new meatless meat options have been made available for those who are reluctant about going vegetarian but can’t quite stomach the impact of meat production. The Impossible Burger, a fake meat offering, has gained plenty of headlines due to the fact it “bleeds” much like the real thing. The $12 burger, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Google, has confused some diners but it’s hoped it will help make people cut down on beef, saving land, water and emissions in the process. There is plenty of competition, too, from brands such as Beyond Meat, Gardein and the venerable Tofurky. Low-carbon concrete Worldwide use of concrete is soaring, largely due to a building boom in China and, to a lesser extent, India. In fact, China has used more cement since 2011 than the US did during the entire 20th century. The greenhouse gas emissions in its production are significant, prompting researchers to come up with a greener alternative. In February, Rutgers University’s Richard Riman announced a new technology that can make a variety of materials, including concrete. Combined with cement, the product can reduce the carbon footprint of cement and concrete by up to 70%, according to the university. “I looked at how shellfish make ceramics at low-temperature, like carbonate crystals, and then looked at what people can do with water to make landing strips in Alaska, and I said we should be able to do this with ceramics, but use a low-temperature chemical process that involves water,” Riman said. “When you can develop technologies that are safe and easy to use, it’s a game-changer.” Lawn treatments A technology company called WISErg has developed a product called the Harvester, which transforms food waste into fertilizer than can be applied to lawns. The product, launched in 2014, has helped the company get more than $30m in investment. In the same area, a startup in Connecticut is working on replacing gasoline-run mowers with a solar-charged alternative that, for each lawn, saves emissions equivalent to those of a car on the road for 12,000 miles. Offshore wind Wind currently supplies around 5% of America’s electricity but the sector is on the up thanks to the introduction of offshore wind farms. In December, the first US offshore wind turbines started turning near a small island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Block Island wind farm is small – capable of powering about 17,000 homes – but has opened up the way for further developments along the coast. Donald Trump isn’t a fan – he has fought a losing battle to prevent a wind farm near one of his golf courses in Scotland – but the falling cost of turbines is making offshore wind more competitive. Maryland is currently mulling two different proposals for offshore wind which would dwarf the Block Island development. Electric cars Electric vehicle sales jumped 70% in 2016, following a disappointing previous year, with more than 30 different models on sale by the end of the year. Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan and Ford lead the way, with more than half of sales occurring in California, which mandates a certain slice of auto sales must be electric. Continued growth could depend on whether a federal tax credit is extended but the electric vehicle market is maturing from a niche oddity to a competitive international field. The Chinese government is calling on auto manufacturers to sell more electric vehicles to improve air quality, with Ford announcing it will electrify 70% of the vehicles sold in the country by 2025. There’s still a long way to go – many drivers still worry about the availability of recharging stations – but this is yet another clean energy market that America could lead in. Geoengineering Even the sober assessment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves much to guesswork when it comes to meeting emissions reduction goals. If the world is to avoid 2C or more of warming, as-yet undeveloped technology will need to be used to extract carbon dioxide from the air at some point, due to the patchy progress in cutting emissions. One desperate intervention could be solar engineering, which is being studied by a team led by David Keith at Harvard University. The researchers are looking at how chemical compounds, such as limestone dust, can be dispersed in the atmosphere, thereby scattering sunlight and sparing an area below from its heat. How this can be achieved, and whether it is even desirable to do so, is an ongoing debate. But if we continue to cook our planet, then governments may have to turn to the likes of Keith to help avert the worst."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2015/jan/29/investors-lose-millions-bond-company-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-29T17:56:52Z","webTitle":"Investors could lose millions as solar energy bond company goes into administration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/29/investors-lose-millions-bond-company-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2015/jan/29/investors-lose-millions-bond-company-administration","fields":{"headline":"Investors could lose millions as solar energy bond company goes into administration","bodyText":"Nearly 1,000 small investors who put a total of £7.5m into “secured” energy bonds which promised to pay an income of 6.5% a year are unlikely to see a penny of their money back after it emerged the cash was siphoned off to an Australian company that later went bust. Secured Energy Bonds were launched in November 2013, with the lure that they were an “environmentally friendly and locally sensitive way” to invest. Buyers were told the money would be used to install solar panels on schools across the UK. But panels were installed at only six schools of the initial 22 schools planned, as the money raised from investors went instead to shore up the worsening financial situation at the parent company, CBD Energy. Accountants Grant Thornton, administrators to CBD Energy, said: “During financial year 2014 CBD used funds of a subsidiary company, Secured Energy Bonds plc, in contravention of the purpose of these funds, to meet the group’s cashflow shortfalls.” CBD Energy is an Australian firm controlled by controversial entrepreneur Gerry McGowan, who set up the country’s first budget airline, Impulse Airlines. He later sold it to Qantas, which used it as the basis for Jetstar. But in October last year McGowan took a leave of absence while the board investigated if the accounts needed restating. Then in November, CBD Energy went into administration. In the same month McGowan sold his Double Bay, Sydney penthouse apartment for a price understood to be above AUS$7m (£3.6m). Grant Thornton said CBD was effectively insolvent from June 2014, and could not meet its liabilities as early as June 2013. Yet British investors were being told throughout this period to “Make an ethical, more secured investment in renewable energy and enjoy the financial rewards.” Investors only learned of the company’s failure when a quarterly interest payment, due on Monday this week, was missed. The investors have no rights to compensation as the bonds are treated the same as shares, and are not covered by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Hopes that there will be any assets to be recovered are dwindling. At the bond’s launch, its promoters said investors would “enjoy a level of security not previously associated with this type of bond”, as the income was secured against “the solar projects, their income flow and the company’s cash reserves. CBD will also give a corporate guarantee”. A London firm called Independent Portfolio Managers (IPM), regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, was appointed as the “security trustee” responsible for safeguarding the interests of bondholders in the event of default. It issued a statement that it only became aware of problems in November 2014, and is now seeking to put Secured Energy Bonds into administration. “The timing and amount of payments are, at this stage, uncertain,” it said. However in Australia, Grant Thornton said “the investment is likely to be substantially impaired”. The failure of Secured Energy Bonds is the first major test of the “retail bond” market that has exploded in popularity in recent years. With interest rates at rock-bottom lows, companies as diverse as Tesco Bank and the Jockey Club have issued bonds paying interest of 5% or more to investors desperate for higher income. SEB was structured as a “mini-bond” that could not be traded. Critics warned that investors were buying without sufficiently examining the risk of defaults. Trillion Fund, a popular crowdfunding platform for renewable energy projects, acted as a lead generator for Secured Energy Bonds, and its failure was “deeply disappointing”. It added that it no longer promotes mini-bonds. In October 2013, city regulators announced a clampdown on aspects of the retail bond industry, saying that they should only be marketed to “sophisticated investors” or to clients of FCA-authorised advisers and managers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-20T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"Onshore windfarms more popular than thought, UK poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds","fields":{"headline":"Onshore windfarms more popular than thought, UK poll finds","bodyText":"Public support for onshore windfarms is far higher than widely believed, according to a new opinion poll, even in rural areas. Wind turbines are also far more popular than fracking or nuclear power, contrasting with the UK government’s decision to block onshore windfarms but back shale gas exploration and new nuclear power plants. The ComRes poll, conducted for climate change charity 10:10, found that 73% of the British public supported onshore windfarms, with just 17% opposed, and the rest not sure. Strong support remained even when only considering the views of those from rural areas, who might live near windfarms: 65% support versus 25% against. However, when people were asked what level of support they thought windfarms had across the country, just one in 10 said it was more than 70%. The average level of support estimated by people was just 42%, far below the true figure. Research for 10:10 conducted by Imperial College London showed that more than two-thirds of newspaper comment and editorial articles in the last five years were negative overall about windfarms. “The UK public love wind power and they don’t even realise,” said Max Wakefield, at 10:10, which launched its Blown Away campaign on Thursday. “It’s plainly not true onshore wind is unpopular with the UK public. It’s time our politicians caught up. Onshore wind is already the cheapest tool we have to achieve energy independence, keep bills under control and tackle climate change.” The government’s own polling has consistently shown that renewable energy has 75-80% public support. But the Conservative victory in 2015, with 37% of the vote, has all but ended onshore windfarm developments, fulfilling a manifesto pledge to do so. The new poll showed even stronger public support for solar energy - 83% for and 8% against - but ministers have slashed solar subsidies. Fracking was supported by 34% and opposed by 45% in the poll. Ministers overruled Lancashire council earlier in October to grant permission for shale gas exploration, leading to accusations of double standards, as local communities have the final say over windfarm applications. Nuclear power was supported by 46% in the new poll and opposed by 37%. In September, the prime minister, Theresa May, gave the go-ahead for a new heavily subsidised nuclear plant at Hinkley in Somerset. Offshore windfarms, which are supported by ministers, are also popular with the public, with 80% supporting and 10% opposing. The ComRes poll interviewed 2,037 British adults online on 12-13 October 2016 and data were weighted to be representative of all British adults."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/29/strong-parliament-will-be-natures-last-line-of-defence-during-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-29T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"A strong parliament will be nature’s last line of defence during Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/29/strong-parliament-will-be-natures-last-line-of-defence-during-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/29/strong-parliament-will-be-natures-last-line-of-defence-during-brexit","fields":{"headline":"A strong parliament will be nature’s last line of defence during Brexit","bodyText":"When Theresa May fires the Brexit starting gun by triggering article 50, she will start a process that could dramatically reshape almost every aspect of British life – from our economy, laws, and place in the world to our natural environment. The difficult choices our politicians make in just a few years could change the face of Britain for generations to come. Even before the tough bargaining with the EU and other countries start in earnest, another, more domestic negotiation process will get underway – the constitutional power struggle between parliament and government over who will have the final say on the momentous Brexit decisions. A lot will ride on the outcome of this tug of war, and that includes the fate of many vital environmental safeguards we take for granted. Over four decades of EU membership, Britain has acquired one of the most formidable bodies of environmental law in the world. Whether it’s air pollution, water quality, or toxic chemicals, many of the environmental safeguards protecting our health and our environment are rooted in EU law. It is EU law that has chivvied a recalcitrant government into cleaning up our beaches, improving recycling rates, and banning bee-harming pesticides. The habitats and birds directives have provided stronger protection for threatened wildlife than any UK law. And it is the EU air quality laws that have allowed campaigners to hold ministers to account for their failure to tackle air pollution in the courts. All these vital protections – the fruits of decades of negotiations, campaigning, and political work – are about to come under an unprecedented amount of pressure. Along with thousands of other EU laws, ministers say that most environmental legislation will be transposed en bloc into domestic law by the “great repeal bill”. Although this might sound like an unalloyed piece of good news, it isn’t. Ministers have already warned that only two-thirds of environmental regulations can be adopted as they are, leaving the remaining third in dangerous limbo. But even the laws that are directly transferred will be put on much shakier ground. The institutions that guarantee their enforcement, such as the European court of justice and the commission, will have no jurisdiction in Britain. So who will hold the government to account? No 10 sources have suggested Theresa May favours the option of the UK remaining a member of EU regulatory agencies, but what powers these watchdogs will retain and what laws they will be able to enforce is not clear. An even greater and more immediate danger lurks in the great repeal bill. Ministers have been talking about including a so-called Henry VIII clause in the bill that would give them the power to change primary legislation without a vote in parliament. In this scenario, an all-powerful executive will be able to cherry-pick which environmental legislation they want to keep while ditching the rest with a stroke of the pen. The vital laws protecting our health and our environment from air pollution, noxious chemicals, and destructive industries will be left hostage to the whims of the government and business lobbies of the day. Clues to how these powers may be used already abound. Michael Gove has openly called for the habitat directive to be scrapped. The environment minister George Eustice is on record describing it as “spirit-crushing”. And a leading Brexiter like Jacob Rees-Mogg has argued Britain could slash environmental and safety regulations on imported products, adopting, for example, emissions standards that are “good enough for India”. Industry lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic have already sniffed an opportunity to do away with regulations that put consumers before corporate profits. A US farming lobbyist recently told Radio 4’s Today programme that any US-UK trade deal would be dependent on Britain allowing imports of US foods that have so far been banned, from chlorine-washed chicken to hormone-infused beef. Leading car makers in the US have already lobbied Trump for weaker fuel economy standards and got what they wanted. It’s hard to see why they wouldn’t attempt to do the same in Britain once the backstop of EU air quality rules has fallen away. Closer to home, the owner of British Gas, Centrica, has urged the government to drop EU targets on renewable energy unless they can be used as a bargaining chip during Brexit negotiations. Since any deployment of wind and solar energy by communities and individual households is a threat to the big six’s stranglehold, Centrica is exploiting Brexit to pull a fast one on the competition and, ultimately, on consumers too. This is just the beginning. The deeper we wade into the quagmire of Brexit negotiations, the more pressure industry lobbies are going to put on our politicians to sacrifice crucial environmental safeguards on the altar of low-standard trade deals. This is why our elected representatives have a crucial role to play in defending the values Britain holds dear. A majority of people have voted for Brexit, but they didn’t vote for a more polluted or less green Britain. This government has no mandate to tamper with the environmental safeguards protecting our parks, our beaches, and our air. If the vague promise about “taking back control” is to be at least partially fulfilled, the crucial decisions about the future of our environment cannot be made over a handshake between ministers and corporate lobbyists. Any changes to this vital legislation must be done in a democratic way – through a parliamentary vote and the thorough public scrutiny that accompanies it. A truly sovereign parliament during Brexit will be the last line of defence for our green and pleasant land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-14T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Toshiba's US nuclear problems could provide cautionary tale for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba's US nuclear problems provide cautionary tale for UK","bodyText":"The roots of Toshiba’s admission this week that it has serious doubts over its “ability to continue as a going concern” can be found near two small US towns. It is the four reactors being built for nuclear power stations outside Waynesboro, in Georgia, and Jenkinsville, South Carolina, by the company’s US subsidiary Westinghouse that have left the Japanese corporation facing an annual loss of £7.37bn. Construction work on the units has run hugely over budget and over schedule, casting a shadow over two of the biggest new nuclear power station projects in the US for years. Events came to a head last month when Westinghouse was forced to file for bankruptcy protection to limit Toshiba’s losses. Westinghouse’s problems in Waynesboro and Jenkinsville could provide a cautionary tale for the UK, which is also embarking on a nuclear power station-building programme. Experts said the delays and cost problems were due to America’s lack of recent experience in building atomic power plants. “I don’t think it is necessarily because of an inherent issue of US skills but rather the lack of practice,” said Richard Nephew, a professor at the Centre on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University. “There simply have not been as many new reactor builds in the US and this has reduced the overall pool of skilled labor, no question.” The absence of a mass production supply chain, due to the small number of the Westinghouse-designed reactors being built, played a part too, he added. Regulatory issues had also delayed construction. Toshiba’s losses stem from Westinghouse’s acquisition in 2015 of the nuclear construction business CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster, which it hoped would solve the delays on the two sites. That deal has now backfired spectacularly, pushing Westinghouse and its parent company to the brink of financial collapse. The regulator for one of the projects, Plant Vogtle, in Georgia, has said Westinghouse’s bankruptcy means the project will require more “time and money”. Meanwhile the utility company paying for the Virgil C Summer Nuclear Generating Station, near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, warned this week that abandonment of the project was one of the options it was now considering. Nephew said: “This experience may push the US into a different model, perhaps focused on smaller modular reactors, or less complicated designs.” The US energy secretary, Rick Perry, signalled the Trump administration’s support for nuclear this week, issuing a statement at the G7 summit in which he said the US backed “advanced civil-nuclear technologies”. That suggested support for next-generation reactors rather than the sort being built by Westinghouse. Richard Morningstar, chairman of the Global Energy Centre at the international affairs thinktank Atlantic Council, said: “What is happening to Westinghouse and Toshiba only emphasises the need to double down on research on new, safe, nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors. If we do not do so in the US, leadership will be ceded to other countries.” One such aspiring atomic leader is the UK, where the government wants to build a new generation of nuclear power stations to help satisfy the country’s power needs for decades to come. But there are obvious parallels between the two countries on the issues of recent experience and supply chains. The UK has not completed a new nuclear power station since Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast started generating power in 1995. EDF, the French state-owned company which has started pouring concrete at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where it plans to have two reactors operational by 2025, maintains it has had plenty of recent practice. The EPR reactor design for Hinkley is the same as that for the reactors it is building in Finland, and at Flamanville, in France, though both of those are running late and over budget. The other new nuclear projects proposed around the UK, all by foreign companies, look less certain and all are still years from construction starting in earnest. Toshiba said this week it would consider selling its shares in the consortium behind another plant planned at Moorside, in Cumbria, which would utilise three of the same AP1000 Westinghouse reactors being built for the two crisis-hit US plants. The South Korean power company Kepco last month expressed an interest in buying into the project, and the business secretary , Greg Clark, went to South Korea last week for talks on collaboration on nuclear power. However, any rescue by Seoul is far from certain. The two leading candidates in South Korea’s elections in May said this week that they favoured rowing back on nuclear power and switching to renewable energy. Kepco would also face a regulatory delay of several years if it wanted to use its own technology at Moorside. Unions in the UK said the uncertainty showed that the government should intervene more directly, by taking a stake in Moorside. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: “The big moral of the story is what on earth we are doing as a country, leaving our fundamental energy requirements to foreign companies or foreign governments?” While the government has argued that it has plans in place to keep the lights on if new nuclear projects do not materialise, others said the deepening crisis at Toshiba this week showed the need for ministers to consider a new energy policy. “It’s time to come up with a new plan A,” said Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute, at University College London, who believes the Moorside project is dead. “It’s time for a viable strategy that talks about grid upgrades, solar, energy efficiency, and energy management.” A report published on Thursday highlighted another alternative: a U-turn on the Conservative party’s manifesto commitment to block new onshore windfarms. Analysis for the trade body Scottish Renewables suggested wind turbines on land had become so cheap they could be built for little or no subsidy, compared to the lucrative contract awarded to EDF for Hinkley. But the prospect of a rethink by the government on wind power looks about as likely as new nuclear power stations being built on time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/26/australias-answer-to-tesla-indigenous-firm-allgrid-shines-in-solar-battery-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-26T00:44:30Z","webTitle":"Australia's answer to Tesla: Indigenous firm AllGrid shines in solar battery industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/26/australias-answer-to-tesla-indigenous-firm-allgrid-shines-in-solar-battery-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/26/australias-answer-to-tesla-indigenous-firm-allgrid-shines-in-solar-battery-industry","fields":{"headline":"Australia's answer to Tesla: Indigenous firm AllGrid shines in solar battery industry","bodyText":"AllGrid Energy, an Indigenous-owned company has emerged as a hopeful minnow beside corporate giants poised to drive the expansion of Australia’s fledgling home solar battery industry. The Brisbane-based upstart looks forward to the looming entry of the global industry’s marquee player, Tesla, as a shot in the arm to the Australian market. While orders for Tesla’s Powerwall have officially begun in Australia amid a reported spike in customer queries – driven by interest in the electric carmaker’s brand – AllGrid Energy is already delivering its system to customers in South Australia and Queensland. The company claims its 10 kilowatt-hour GridWatt system at $12,000 is up to 30% cheaper than the Powerwall. The GridWatt is cheaper because it features older tubular lead acid gel batteries in an aluminium cabinet that must be installed outside a home, as opposed to Tesla’s smaller, indoors package based on lithium batteries. But AllGrid’s marketing manager, Deborah Oberon, said the company hoped its “cost-effective” offering would encourage take-up, particularly in the remote Indigenous communities where its parent company operates. The company’s chief executive and majority shareholder, Raymond Pratt, is a Darwin-based Indigenous man who parlayed his trade ticket as an electrician into founding the electrical and construction services outfit Dice Australia. A key opportunity for AllGrid beckons in remote Indigenous communities which rely on costly and emissions-heavy diesel generators. “Obviously as an Indigenous company working with Indigenous communities, it’s a really big area of traction for us,” Oberon said. The end result of these “commercial scale” solar systems would be “energy wealth and energy autonomy” for those remote communities. AllGrid has a number of feasibility studies under way for Indigenous communities both on and off the national power grid, Oberon says, with plans to train local Indigenous electricians to install those systems. Tesla and AllGrid are among a broad field of players looking to capitalise on a promising market for solar batteries in Australia, where per capita take-up of rooftop solar panels leads the world. Energy storage systems give households with solar power the opportunity to further cut reliance on the nation’s largely coal-fired electricity grid, even during peak demand times when the sun has gone down. AllGrid claims its storage systems, which are assembled at a factory in Brisbane’s south, can cut household grid power consumption by 75%. Oberon said that although orders were “ticking along” thanks to the interest of early adopters, 2016 would be “the year that storage really starts to kick off in Australia”. “Once Tesla’s system is available in February, that will be the moment the game really starts to change,” she said. “With the coverage and publicity that a company like Tesla get, we’re really confident the market will heat up.” In the new year, the company was also slated to build a solar power storage system for a student housing and crisis accommodation group in Sydney, which earned an innovation grant through the city council this month to fund it. “Students are a demographic that typically experience energy stress and energy poverty so once again our clients’ commitment to community means we’re really looking for models where people who are in those kind of situations, we can advantage them through the types of systems that we supply and the types of funding models we use to get those in place,” Oberon said. Oberon said the company was about to strike a deal with an unnamed electricity retailer to offer an increased “feed in” tariff – or the price paid for surplus power fed back into the grid – a key incentive for solar panel owners who missed out on the generous rates offered to early adopters in previous years. Bendigo Bank also offers relatively cheap finance at 6.7% a year for customers buying the systems, and they can also roll that over into their mortgages. The WattGrid is being sold for about $12,000, about $3,000 less than a comparable set-up being advertised for the Powerwall. AllGrid has also released a solar energy system, the PortaGrid, for remote locations where tapping into the national power grid is not an option. It comes with the option of a weather monitor that automatically closes up the solar panels in severe weather events like cyclones. Oberon said the company was talking to the national parks and wildlife service about using the PortaGrid to replace diesel generators in remote sites. Oberon said the technology, developed with AllGrid’s second parent company, the renewable energy company Consolidated Industrial Holdings, could be particularly attractive in developing countries. AllGrid also has its sights on developing storage systems with saltwater batteries that it says could last twice as long as lead acid batteries. Oberon said the current AllGrid systems were designed so that the tubular gel batteries could be “easily swapped” with more advanced batteries at the end of their life."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2017/jan/21/batteries-included-yorkshire-village-seeks-to-solve-riddle-of-too-much-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-21T08:00:30Z","webTitle":"Batteries included: Yorkshire village seeks to solve riddle of too much sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/21/batteries-included-yorkshire-village-seeks-to-solve-riddle-of-too-much-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jan/21/batteries-included-yorkshire-village-seeks-to-solve-riddle-of-too-much-sun","fields":{"headline":"Batteries included: Yorkshire village seeks to solve riddle of too much sun","bodyText":"The bungalows of Oxspring may look an unlikely testing ground for a new technology billed as a way to help renewable power, stymie energy price rises and aid the local power grid. But later this month, dozens of homes in this South Yorkshire village will have a home battery installed as part of a £250,000 trial to see if they can make solar power more valuable to homeowners and less painful for grid managers. Smaller than the high-profile Powerwalls introduced to the UK by Elon Musk’s Tesla last year, the British-engineered batteries will be fitted for free in 30 homes with solar panels on their roofs and 10 without. The project is a response to what until recently would have seemed an improbable challenge for the UK: too much solar power. There are now 875,000 homes with solar photovoltaic panels, and that is beginning to pose issues for network operators. In Oxspring, a community energy company found it could only install solar panels at two in three homes because of constraints on the amount of power that can be pushed into the grid. Energy storage company Moixa and the local network operator, Northern Powergrid, hope their pilot will “timeshift” solar for use at peak times and show storage can reduce network bottlenecks and cut out the need for costly upgrades, which would be passed on to energy bill-payers. “In northern Europe, solar produces the most energy when you don’t need it [at midday]. The amount of solar in the UK is meaningful now, and that’s translating to challenges [to grids] and costs to customers,” said Simon Daniel, chief executive of Moixa, who sees better storage as the solution. The company has around 600 batteries in homes across the UK, which it aggregates to act like one big battery, effectively a virtual power station. The Oxspring householders will either benefit from using more of their solar power – the electricity is more valuable if consumed in the house rather than exported to the grid – while the non-solar homes will get a cheque of £50-£75 each year from Moixa for aiding the local network. The trial near Barnsley is just one sign of a growing energy storage market in Britain. Companies such as Tesla and London-based Powervault do not publish sales numbers, but Germany’s Sonnen says it has sold hundreds of storage systems in the UK. The total installed is thought to be in the four figures. Most players have so far targeted householders hoping to increase the financial gain from their solar panels. But the introduction of time-of-day energy tariffs, enabled by smart meters, mean householders could potentially store electricity when it’s cheap, for use later when it’s pricier. Combined with the advent of rebates for “grid services” to connected batteries such as the Oxspring ones, they could dramatically widen home batteries’ appeal. Industry group the Electricity Storage Network describes 2017 as a “watershed” year for the technology. Sonnen said it was receiving a surge of customer enquiries, and predicted the UK market would take off this year. Powervault, which says it wants to make home batteries as commonplace as dishwashers and washing machines, started a £625,000 trial in south-east England last month. The project with UK Power Networks involves batteries in 60 homes. “The purpose is to enable us to harness more of the solar energy that’s generated during the day, when demand for energy is low, and release it onto the network at the morning and evening peaks,” said a spokesman for UK Power Networks, the UK’s biggest network operator. “National Grid spends about £1bn a year balancing demand and supply of energy. Currently they pay that money largely to big power stations but in the future we’ll move to a scenario where it also goes to a collective of batteries,” said Joe Warren, MD of Powervault, which began selling home batteries in 2014. He said Tesla’s arrival last year raised consumer awareness and argued that the market is big enough to sustain several companies: “There’s definitely room for a British energy storage player.” However, its US rival is upping the ante with a new, higher capacity version of its battery, which is in such demand that anyone buying one today can only get it in March at the earliest. Tesla, which earlier this month switched on the first sections of its battery-making Gigafactory in Nevada, begins installing the first of the new generation of Powerwall 2s in UK homes in February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-08T18:09:46Z","webTitle":"Britain can’t preach on climate change while it dismantles its green economy | John Ashton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","fields":{"headline":"Britain can’t preach on climate change while it dismantles its green economy","bodyText":"Rule one of diplomacy is, walk your talk: otherwise people stop listening. In Paris last week David Cameron called for “action today”, not excuses tomorrow, on climate change. Back home, his ministers are already making excuses for what looks increasingly like a systematic repudiation of 10 years of successful action to build a prosperous low-carbon economy in Britain. The Green MP Caroline Lucas is right to have called this a “spectacular display of cognitive dissonance”. Not surprisingly, the world is beginning to notice. “On eve of Paris climate summit, Britain pulls plug on renewables”, read a recent headline in the Washington Post. The job of government on climate change is to ensure attractive and stable conditions for investment in the low-carbon transition. In recent months our government has hit the brakes on onshore wind and solar energy, on energy efficiency and on community renewable schemes. Its plan to sell off the Green Investment Bank will destroy a crucial financing mechanism. Its trashing of a 10-year effort to make the UK a leader in carbon capture and storage blew away more than £100m in imminent investment from China. Its surreptitious edging away from its 2020 renewables target casts doubt on all its climate promises. Meanwhile our energy secretary, Amber Rudd, has invited a new dash for gas. If implemented at the scale apparently intended, this will kill the Climate Change Act by steadily undermining our capacity to stick to its legally binding carbon pathway. The government’s unnecessary and undeliverable obsessions with disruptive fracking and expensive nuclear energy will further chill investment in renewables and energy efficiency. And as camouflage for her boss in Paris, Rudd has claimed credit for a phase-out of coal that her predecessors had already made inevitable. Our government claims to want coherent policies. So why did it slap a carbon tax, the climate change levy, on carbon-neutral renewable energy? Our government claims to want value for money. So why is it signing up for a nuclear power plant that will make our electricity needlessly expensive for 20 years while putting obstacles in the path of onshore wind, the cheapest form of carbon-neutral energy? Our government claims to want local people to decide on local infrastructure. So why is it desperate to force fracking on unwilling communities while obstructing the renewables schemes they desire? Recent dismay from the Scottish government is a warning that these policies may sow new divisions between London and Edinburgh. Scotland needs more, not less, ambition nationally to realise the potential of its abundant renewable energy resources and escape from its unhealthy dependence on North Sea oil and gas. Privatisation of the Green Investment Bank will weaken the attraction of Edinburgh, where it is based, as a centre for low-carbon finance. When our leaders speak, we should not only listen to what they say but read their lips. Reading the lips of Rudd and the chancellor, George Osborne, it is hard to escape the conclusion that these incoherent, unconvincing policies seem driven more by ideology and casual expediency than by a serious assessment of what Britain needs. Any incoming government is entitled to make changes. There were gaps and contradictions in the energy and climate policies this government inherited. But in its response there is little sign of real intent to make sure that our country does at home what our prime minister has just urged on the rest of the world. Every step it has taken has been a step backwards. Conditions for investment are now less attractive and less stable. That imposes extra risks on investors – risks consumers will be asked to pay for. That is, of course, on top of the growing risks to our people arising from climate change itself. The floods that have brought death and suffering to Lancashire and Cumbria are just the latest reminder of those. As for diplomacy, the world’s governments will probably agree this week on a new basis for global action on climate. It will be a step forward. But it will only take us, at best, to the end of the beginning. Whether we can achieve the sustained effort that this challenge really demands will depend less on deals about to be done in Paris and more on choices made globally over the next five years as governments strive to turn their promises into action and push up levels of ambition that are still inadequate. The UK’s backward lurch has, thankfully, come too late to damage prospects at Paris. But it is nonsense to claim, as our ministers have, that the choices they are making will not cut our diplomacy off at the knees. And it is rich for them to accuse other parties of weaponising climate policy when it is they who have broken the cross-party consensus that gave our diplomacy a special edge. No country has done more than Britain to spur global progress on climate. We have done that by walking our talk, with strong diplomacy based on a strong domestic base. It would be a tragedy and a betrayal of our national interest if, just as our competitors pick up the pace, we start giving succour to those nations and industries that want to slow down an endeavour on whose success all our destinies depend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/28/solar-energy-sunflower-ibm-airlight-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-27T23:05:03Z","webTitle":"Solar energy: a sunflower solution to electricity shortage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/28/solar-energy-sunflower-ibm-airlight-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/28/solar-energy-sunflower-ibm-airlight-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy: a sunflower solution to electricity shortage","bodyText":"Computer giant IBM last week revealed the prototype of its advanced solar electricity generators: a 30ft-high concrete “sunflower” fitted with wafer-thin aluminium mirrors and a maze of tiny tubes for carrying coolant through the heart of each device. The machines, which will be built in conjunction with the Swiss company Airlight Energy, can convert 80% of the sun’s radiation into electricity and hot water, it is claimed, with each generating 12 kilowatts of electricity and 20kW of heat on a sunny day, enough to supply several homes. At the device’s official unveiling in Zurich, executives for both companies said they hoped that by 2017, when their sunflower generators should be ready for the market, they could be manufactured for half to one-third of the cost of comparable solar converters today. According to IBM, the machine’s secret lies with the microscopic tubes that carry water through the cluster of photovoltaic chips at the heart of each device. This system has already been adopted by IBM to cool its high-performance supercomputers. “We were inspired by the branched blood supply of the human body,” said Bruno Michel, from the IBM Research laboratories in Zurich. The sunflower operates by tracking the sun so that it always points in the best direction for collecting its rays; these are then focused on to a cluster of photovoltaic cells that are mounted on a raised platform. The cells convert solar radiation into electricity. However, without the microchannel cooling system, which carries distilled water through the chips, temperatures would reach more than 1,000C. With the microcooling system, which carries water to within a few millimetres of the back of each chip, temperatures are kept down to 90C – a far safer, and far more efficient, operating level. Electricity is generated while the system also produces large amounts of hot water from the cooling system. “That hot water is a game changer,” added Michel. “Electricity is obviously vitally useful but so is the heat – for we can use it for desalinating water.” At present, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. However, that figure is dwarfed by the number – 2.5 billion – who have no access to proper sanitation. And according to figures supplied by Airlight Energy, that latter number is currently increasing at a rate of 9% a year. However, the IBM-Airlight sunflower is designed to tackle both problems. The electricity will have numerous uses while the hot water can be pumped through desalinators that use porous membranes to boil salt water and distil the result into pure, drinkable water. A large installation made up of several generators could provide enough fresh water for an entire town, it was claimed at last week’s launch. Apart from sites in Africa, the Middle East and Australia, it is hoped the sunflower system will be used for remote hospitals, hotels and holiday resorts. IBM says it will instal its first two devices for free in 2016 and has asked towns around the world to put their names forward to be the first to have a solar sunflower erected on their land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2015/dec/04/africa-global-warming-paris-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-04T13:48:56Z","webTitle":"Paris climate talks: Africa means business on global warming |  Akinwumi Adesina","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/04/africa-global-warming-paris-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/dec/04/africa-global-warming-paris-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"Africa means business on global warming – does the rest of the world?","bodyText":"The term “glacial pace” takes on real and literal meaning with climate change. The disappearance of our glaciers may have hastened dramatically, but our efforts to stop them doing so have moved at a truly glacial pace. This has to change, right now. Since the Kyoto protocol came into being, we have failed miserably to protect our planet. Current trajectories show the world is on track towards a temperature rise of about 3C by 2100. Climate talks in Paris this month are our last chance to turn the tide. We have long known that Africa, which causes the least environmental damage, suffers the most from the harm others cause. The World Meteorological Organisation recorded more than 1,300 climate-related natural disasters in Africa from 1970 to 2012, which claimed 700,000 lives and caused economic damage worth $26.6bn (£17.6bn). A decade ago, at COP 11 in Montreal in 2005, Africa had no common position and no common negotiators. This year, at COP 21, it has a Conference of African Heads of State on Climate Change; it has an expert team of about 200 climate negotiators; it has a clearly outlined position on the negotiations; and it has a well-articulated collective work programme to support low-carbon and climate-resilient development on the continent. So Africa means business on climate change. It comes to Paris not just with hope, but with something to offer. It brings three big “gives” to the rest of the world, and three big “asks”. First, Africa gives its own commitment – and the cast-iron evidence – that it will join the rest of the world in taking climate change seriously. Forty-seven out of 53 countries in Africa had already completed their “intended nationally determined contributions” by the 1 October deadline. Each national plan states what the country can do, from tiny Comoros committing to cutting emissions by 85% in 15 years, to Ethiopia announcing plans to cut its emissions growth by 64% in the same period. African countries have demonstrated greater ambition in cutting their emissions than the high-emitting nations. Second, Africa makes the gift – to itself and the world – of its enormous renewable energy resources. That potential is breathtaking: the continent can source an additional 10 terawatts of solar energy, 1,300 gigawatts of wind power, and 15GW of geothermal potential. That power, if used to the full and responsibly managed, will not just solve Africa’s own energy problems but also those of other countries near and far. Third, Africa gives to the world a share of the gigantic atmospheric vacuum cleaners that are its natural tropical forests. It has an estimated 650m hectares (1.605bn acres) of untouched forest, almost a fifth of the world’s stock. These carbon sinks can suck in 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – about half the carbon dioxide emissions from all the homes in the US. And they can do this, even under the threat of deforestation and forest degradation. If we can preserve our forest, for instance in the Congo basin, we can absorb more of our own and the world’s carbon dioxide. But Africa, of course, seeks support in kind from the world. It brings three “asks” to COP21, all of which are aimed at completing the circle of giving. First, Africa asks for adequate finance – at least $11bn a year – to help it adapt to climate change. Only 4% of the world’s total adaptation finance ends up in sub-Saharan Africa, a situation that demands immediate reform. Africa, which is already short-changed on climate change, must not be short-changed on climate finance. Communities that have contributed the least to climate change should not be the ones picking up the tab when Mother Earth fights back. As we write, southern and eastern Africa are suffering floods and droughts respectively, brought about by the worst El Niño – warm winds blowing off warm waters – in decades. Second, Africa asks the world to join it in investing at least $55bn a year in its energy sector up to 2030. Why? Mainly because this would bring full energy access to more than 600 million Africans who do not have that today. Patchy energy means patchy business, patchy health and patchy education. It means diminished life. The lack of energy has put the brakes on Africa’s development. Why should the rest of the world buy into this? Because, by developing clean energy in Africa, we will collectively remove billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases from the air. And because – given the returns on renewable energy – we will collectively unlock millions of dollars in new business opportunities. Witness the solar power project in Ouarzazate in Moroccowhich has generated 500MW and cut an annual 760,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The third and last ask is that the countries of the world reassess the demands they are making of one another. Limiting the global temperature rise to 2C is not enough: we stand with the International Panel on Climate Change in wanting a revised target of 1.5 degrees. The continent of proverbs reminds us that “in moments of crisis, the wise build bridges”. We are indeed in a crisis, and Africa is asking the rest of the world to join us in building bridges to a safer world. So let’s be wise in Paris. • Akinwumi Adesina is the president of the African Development Bank"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/03/hydrogen-cars-electrolysers-dawn-australia-hydrogen-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-02T19:40:58Z","webTitle":"Hydrogen cars and electrolysers: the dawn of Australia's hydrogen economy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/03/hydrogen-cars-electrolysers-dawn-australia-hydrogen-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/03/hydrogen-cars-electrolysers-dawn-australia-hydrogen-economy","fields":{"headline":"Hydrogen cars and electrolysers: the dawn of Australia's hydrogen economy?","bodyText":"The hydrogen economy has been a long time coming. The use of hydrogen as a replacement energy source for oil and gas has been talked about since the early 1970s when the term was first coined by an engineer at General Motors in the US. It still hasn’t really arrived. And doubters remain. They point to the heavy infrastructure needed to support the technology, the huge amount of energy it consumes, and wonder how it can compete with the falling costs of wind and solar energy, and the surging interest in electric vehicles (EVs) . Ironically, it is those very factors that are making the idea of a hydrogen economy appealing again. Wind and solar provide cheap energy, EVs are perfecting the drive trains [the power delivery system from engine to wheels] that hydrogen cars will use, and there have been significant technology breakthroughs making the hardware needed to make hydrogen much more cost-competitive. Now it appears that in Australia, the hydrogen economy is going to have its first home in the Australian Capital Territory. Having put in place the architecture and the contracts to ensure that the equivalent of 100% of the electricity needs are sourced from wind and solar by 2020, the Labor government in the ACT is looking at how that clean energy can be used for transport and heating. The environment and energy minister, Simon Corbell, recently announced that the two companies – Spain’s Union Fenosa and France’s Neoen – that won bids to provide electricity to build large wind farms to supply the ACT will invest $180m to develop hydrogen facilities. Union Fenosa, the developer of the Crookwell Wind Farm, will look at how to use hydrogen as a substitute for natural gas in gas-fired generators, either alone or in combination with natural gas; while Neoen will build Australia’s first commercial electrolyser to create hydrogen for vehicles and other uses. Union Fenosa will invest $125m, including a research and development partnership with the Australian National University and ActewAGL Distribution. This will focus on renewable energy power to gas, investigating efficiencies in the production of hydrogen from renewables and how it can then be introduced to the ACT gas network or provide support to the electricity network. A pilot testing facility will also be established in the ACT to produce hydrogen from water using the ACT’s 100% renewable electricity supply. For Garth Heron, the head of wind energy for Neoen in Australia, the idea of building Australia’s first commercial electrolyser came up as part of his company’s tender for the wind contract. He says there are three factors that made him change his mind about hydrogen energy. The first is hydrogen cars. These are often dismissed by EV enthusiasts as being just like petrol cars but with different fuel. That’s not exactly right. Hydrogen cars will use the same electric drive train as EVs, and because EVs are now a major focus of production, half the development problem is solved. Furthermore, in hydrogen cars, the fuel cell – which is as easy to fill as a petrol car, according to its proponents – replaces the petrol engine, while in EVs, it’s the battery that replaces the engine. The second issue is the amount of wind and solar energy used. The biggest input for making hydrogen is electricity. To make hydrogen, you need an electrolyser: electricity and water go in one end, and hydrogen and oxygen come out the other. But the process consumes a lot of power. Heron says that because wind and solar often produce excess energy, driving down wholesale electricity costs, this can then be used to power the electrolysers. The third factor is new technology which means these electrolysers can be switched on and off in an instant, taking advantage of the plunges in the wholesale price of electricity, and also providing network and load support when required. Neoen is teaming up with Siemens – which built the wind turbines for its big Hornsdale wind farm in South Australia – and will contribute $55m towards the cost of a 1.25MW electrolyser in the ACT. That’s enough to keep 1,200 hydrogen cars going each year, but initially it will power a fleet of just 20 new-generation Hyundai hydrogen cars, enough to test the infrastructure. Still, that 20 will be the first hydrogen fleet in the country. “The idea of a hydrogen fleet of vehicles sounds rather old-fashioned,” Garth says. “It was an idea in vogue about 10 years ago, and people thought that because of battery technology, it made no sense. But then we started hearing more about hydrogen – from Hyundai and Siemens, and looking at what Toyota was doing, we realised that the technology has moved quite far.” “We wanted something that was major and long-lasting and could help turn the dial. And we wanted an idea that could attract business and others to the ACT to be part of the hydrogen economy that we hope will come out of it.” Heron says using electricity at low cost means fuel for hydrogen cars might be around 75c/litre. But still, there is more work to be done. “The main thing holding back the idea of hydrogen cars is infrastructure. We are not there yet. It is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. We need infrastructure there to get cost down but without cars, there is no need for infrastructure. This plan in the ACT is to try to get around the situation. And we’re not saying hydrogen will replace every electric vehicle. We think there is lot of technology that common to both.” Currently Hyundai has a single hydrogen car in Australia as a demonstration model and plans that its fleet of 20 will come from a new, yet-to-be-released SUV-style vehicle. “This is the first order in the world for the vehicle,” says Hyundai spokesman Bill Thomas. The concept is so new it does not have a name, but could be based loosely around the Intrado concept car. “The ACT initiative is significant, because it is a forward looking and visionary statement about the potential for hydrogen for transport,” he says. And that is what attracts Corbell to the idea. He says the program to achieve 100% renewable energy for its electricity needs has made the ACT a centre for renewable energy and research. Half a dozen clean tech companies have made the ACT their home and a renewable energy hub at the Canberra Institute of Technology at Bruce has become a centre for research. Like the ACT’s groundbreaking battery storage initiative – a program to install batteries in 5,000 homes and businesses – the hydrogen initiative will attract more investment, says Corbell. And it won’t cost the local government or taxpayers a single dollar. It was Neoen and Union Fenosa who, quite separately, brought the idea of hydrogen to the ACT as part of their wind auction tenders. “This is an exciting project, and it is industry-led,” Corbell says. “We are not reaching a view that this technology will win over others. But it is a way to seize an opportunity to attract investment from companies – like Hyundai and Siemens – and grow our capacity to innovate. “That’s our opportunity. We [the ACT] are not manufacturers. But we can export ideas, innovation and skills. That’s why we are supportive of these opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/dec/21/trumps-solar-renewables-future-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-21T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Trump’s potentially toxic effect on the solar industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/21/trumps-solar-renewables-future-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/21/trumps-solar-renewables-future-industry","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s potentially toxic effect on the solar industry","bodyText":"The solar industry is wary. US president-elect Donald Trump has picked climate sceptics and oil industry executives for key positions in his administration, promising to scrap President Obama’s clean power plan and withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Underlying these concerns is a gnawing fear that the rapid expansion of solar energy generation overseen by Obama could soon be undermined. The US installed a record 4.1GW of solar power in 2016’s third quarter, 191% up on the same period last year, in a boom fuelled by investment tax credits (ITCs) that offer solar and wind firms a 30% tax rebate. Industry leaders fear the tax credits may not survive a Trump administration which has vowed to cut $100bn (£80bn) of climate spending, and will need to find more savings to fund $6.2tn (£5tn) of tax cuts. “The tax credit will cost around $50bn in the period to 2022 and might be an easy choice for Trump,” said James Watson, the CEO of SolarPower Europe. “He’s got a very sceptical climate team around him who would not be too worried about cutting back the ITCs.” Solar employs more than oil and gas extraction Any moves in this direction could increase US emissions and have a toxic effect internationally, just as the budding solar industry is nearing cost parity with fossil fuels such as coal and gas. Renewable energy companies have already been battered by Trump’s victory, with shares in one US solar giant, SunPower Corp, plummeting 14% the day after the election. However, Trump has not yet commented on the future of the ITCs and some analysts say he may be loathe to go up against Republicans in Congress who recently voted to extend the scheme until 2022. Taylor Dimsdale, the head of the E3G thinktank in Washington, said that while signals from the Trump team had so far been mixed “to put it mildly”, its planned fossil fuel renaissance could be met without axing renewable subsidies. “There’s pretty strong bipartisan support for renewable energy,” he said. “A republican-controlled Congress just extended solar tax credits after a not particularly gruelling battle, because the solar industry is important in many states that are controlled by Republican legislatures and governors.” More Americans are now employed in the solar industry than on oil rigs or gas fields so cutbacks would face resistance. Even so, Dimsdale warned that if Trump makes good on a promise to cut corporation tax to 15%, “the ITC could be one of the first things to go”. Trump won’t derail solar growth Not all solar companies are so pessimistic. Milan Nitzschke, the vice president of SolarWorld, the largest solar panel manufacturer in the EU and US, said: “I have no concerns that the US market will not grow in the next years, as it did before. Mr Trump is a businessman and will already know that solar is one of cheapest sources of electricity. In the end, we should not forget that the sun is a great American energy source.” Few analysts foresee a contraction of the US solar industry even under a Trump presidency, but many expect growth to slow. Watson said that without the clean energy plan, “at best we will be looking at maintaining installation levels of around 8-10GW a year”. Trump’s outspoken stand against Chinese trade practices could even benefit the US and European markets, by restricting cheap solar panel imports, according to Nitzschke. SolarWorld has been an outlier in the solar industry, pushing strongly for anti-dumping measures against China. While Nitzschke is also president of the EU ProSun anti-dumping lobby group. He said: “If the US and its president-elect take concrete actions against China’s breaking of WTO trade rules and destruction of manufacturing jobs, it can grow its solar market and domestic solar industry.” Most European solar firms view the current tariffs on Chinese solar panels as an unnecessary tax on the industry that constrains expansion, and postpones the day that subsidies can be dispensed with altogether. SolarPower Europe, however, expects the Obama administration’s tariffs on Chinese solar panels to be continued without change. “Trump is talking about a 50% tax on all Chinese goods entering the US but solar duties are already much higher than that,” Watson said.

In fact, with the World Meteorological Organisation stating that 2016 is likely to be the hottest year on record, it’s no surprise an estimated 1.6bn new air conditioners are likely to be installed globally by 2050. Powering all these units will be a challenge, especially on summer’s hottest days. In Australia, peak demand days can drive electricity usage to almost double and upgrading infrastructure to meet the increased demand can cost more than four times what each additional air-conditioning unit costs. Yet an emerging sector of the solar industry is turning the searing heat of summer into cooling by using solar heat or electricity. For those developing the technology, the benefits of solar cooling are obvious: the days when cooling is needed the most are also the days when solar works best. When combined with a building’s hot water and heating systems – which together with cooling account for around half of the global energy consumption in buildings – solar cooling can drastically reduce reliance on grid energy and improve a building’s sustainability credentials. According to the International Energy Agency, solar could cover almost 17% of global cooling needs by 2050. Currently, such systems are still the exception. “It hasn’t got into the mainstream yet,” says Ken Guthrie, who chairs the International Energy Agency’s Solar Heating and Cooling Program. Nevertheless, several solar cooling technologies are making their way to market. While off-the-shelf systems for most are still years away, a handful of businesses have already opted for purpose-designed solar cooling systems, which experts hope will convince others to follow their lead. Echuca regional hospital in rural Victoria was one of the first to take the leap into solar cooling. In 2010, with support from Sustainability Victoria, the hospital designed and installed a solar heat–driven absorption chiller with engineering firm WSP consultants. A 300 sq m roof-mounted evacuated tube solar field feeds hot water to a 500 kW chiller that was set to save the hospital $60,000 on energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 1,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The system was not designed to run entirely off solar (a gas-fired boiler takes up the slack on hot days), but “we have had days where we run 100% solar” for both cooling and hot water, says Echuca regional health executive project manager Mark Hooper. The benefits of solar were clear enough that a larger 1,500 kW chiller, connected to a field of trough-shaped solar collectors that track the sun during the day, was installed during the hospital’s recent expansion and redevelopment. This second chiller started operating in November and an analysis of the resulting energy and emissions savings will be assessed in conjunction with CSIRO. Meanwhile, Stockland Wendouree shopping centre in Ballarat, Victoria, is trialling a CSIRO-designed solar cooling system with funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). Trough-shaped metal collectors on the centre’s rooftop collect solar heat that is used to dry out a desiccant matrix (much like the silica gel sachets in your shoebox) that dehumidifies air brought in from outside. The hot, dry air is then directed to an indirect evaporative cooler, which delivers cool, dry air into the shopping centre. The yearlong trial is still under way and hasn’t yet seen a full summer to calculate energy savings, but “it’s going very well,” says CSIRO’s Stephen White. The system is 50% more efficient than an earlier iteration of the design – an important improvement given many buildings don’t have the sprawling rooftop spaces of a shopping centre to mount large solar collector arrays. With photovoltaic cells more affordable than ever, cooling systems that run off solar electricity are already commercially available. But solar thermal systems could still find a place in the market, according to Guthrie, especially for larger commercial buildings. “There’s no single solution,” he says. Like any solar technology, solar cooling doesn’t work 24/7. Storing the solar energy collected during the day for use overnight is possible. Stockland’s system uses thermal oil storage, for example, and Echuca regional hospital has insulated its firewater tanks to store chilled water. But there are also efforts to store heat or cooling from one season to the next using underground storage tanks. Whichever systems a building adopts, White says the benefits of solar cooling extend beyond electricity savings. “It’s not just about the cents per kilowatt hour avoided, but it’s also about the value of the asset itself,” he says. For Hooper, the motivation was even simpler: “We did it to ensure that our children have a future.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-16T14:00:33Z","webTitle":"Is Boston the next urban farming paradise?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups","fields":{"headline":"Is Boston the next urban farming paradise?","bodyText":"For those seeking mild, year-round temperatures and affordable plots of land, Boston, with its long winters and dense population, isn’t the first city that comes to mind. But graduates of the city’s nearly 35 colleges and universities are contributing to the area’s growing reputation as a haven for startups challenging and transforming age-old industries, from furniture to political fundraising. The city’s strong entrepreneurial spirit, combined with progressive legislation like the passing of Article 89, has also turned Boston into one of the nation’s hubs for urban agriculture. The inspiration for Freight Farms, an urban farming business headquartered in South Boston, was launched after co-founders and friends Jon Friedman and Brad McNamara realized that New England currently gets almost 90% of its food from outside the region, yet 10-15% of households still report that they don’t have enough to eat. The over reliance on imported produce drove Friedman and McNamara to launch a Kickstarter campaign in 2011 for their farming business, which sells freight containers to would-be farmers, many of whom aren’t necessarily farmers by trade, but are interested in contributing to sustainable living. A Freight Farms container is designed to be largely self sustained, and uses solar energy to provide the majority of electricity required to grow the crops. Julia Pope, who works in farmer education and support at the organization, says people can find the freight containers squeezed between two buildings, in a parking lot, under an overpass, or virtually anywhere in the modern urban terrain. Freight Farms has spread north from Boston to Canada, and Pope says there are just over 100 of the company’s container farms operating in the US alone. The company outfits each 40ft container with the equipment for the entire farming cycle, from germination to harvest. This equipment, which the company calls Leafy Green Machine (LGM), creates a hydroponic system, a soil-free growing method that uses recirculated water with higher nutrient levels to help plants grow. Vertical growing towers line the inside of the shipping container, with LED lights optimized for each stage of the growing cycle. Farmers can manage conditions remotely using a smartphone app called Farmhand, which connects to live cameras inside the container. Pope says that of customers who have purchased the LGM, more than 50 have started small businesses, each consistently producing two acres worth of food year-round. One of these businesses is Corner Stalk Farm, which sells locally grown leafy greens – including kale, mint and arugula, as well as more than varieties of lettuce, to cater to demand at various farmers markets in Boston and Somerville, the city’s landmark Boston Public Market, and through orders from produce delivery services (such as Amazon Fresh) that are increasingly popular in cities. It’s no small feat to own and operate the LGM: purchasing one of the containers will run an aspiring business $85,000, with operating costs adding up to another estimated $13,000 per year. Luckily, steady consumer demand, evidenced by more than 139 farmers markets across the state of Massachusetts alone, help to offset the high costs to starting and running an urban farm. Hannah Brown, a resident of Boston’s North End, regularly shops at the Boston Public Market, which sells locally sourced goods from more than 30 small businesses. “There aren’t many stores with really fresh produce in the immediate area, so it’s definitely filled a need for me,” she says. Brown also finds the small business owners who sell their produce at the market to be an invaluable resource: “It’s great to be able to talk with the people working the produce stands, because they can recommend what’s freshest and how to prepare it.” As a result, she says she’s taken to only buying produce that’s in season and adjusting her habits to align with what’s available to her locally. The growing popularity of urban farming owes much to a former mayor, Thomas Menino, and one of his final acts while in office. He signed into law Article 89, expanded zoning laws to permit farming in freight containers, on rooftops, and in larger ground-level farms. Article 89 made it possible for those practitioners to sell their locally grown food within city limits. One business that has taken advantage of Article 89 is Green City Growers, which runs Fenway Farms, is a 5,000-sq ft rooftop farm above Fenway Park. The rooftop is lined with plants grown in stackable milk crate containers, which are equipped with a weather sensitive drip irrigation system that monitors the moisture of the soil in the crates to make sure plants get just the right amount of water. Although the farm isn’t open to the general public, it is visible to fans from the baseball park, and a stop on the Fenway Park tour. Boston is far from alone in passing legislation that makes farming a possibility for city-dwellers. In Sacramento, there are even tax incentives for property owners who agree to put their vacant plots of land to active agricultural use for at least five years, while the city council of San Antonio voted just last year to pass legislation that makes urban farming legal throughout city limits. And while Boston boasts home to various agricultural startups and nonprofits, entrepreneurs in other parts of the country are contributing to a national farming movement in their own ways: Kimbal Musk, brother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, recently set up a container farm in an old Pfizer factory in Brooklyn, while Local Roots Farms is turning shipping containers into urban farms (using the same hydroponic method that the LGM uses) across the Los Angeles area. As Bostonians now find themselves with a slew of new options to grow and profit from fresh produce on rooftops and in alleyways, some nonprofit organizations are looking to use urban farming as an educational asset. CitySprouts was born in Cambridge in 2001 after executive director Jane Hirschi identified what she calls “an immense need for children to understand where their food was coming from”. CitySprouts teams up with educators to set aside class time for students to cultivate gardens on school property that they can grow their own food in. There are now more than 20 public schools using CitySprouts gardens in the Boston area, and more than 300 public school teachers participating in the fresh food program. Caitlin O’Donnell, who teaches first grade at Fletcher Maynard Academy in nearby Cambridge, says the program does a great job of giving urban kids the opportunity to interact with their environment in ways they wouldn’t have otherwise, she adds. “Whether students are digging for worms, sketching roots structures, crushing apples for cider, or sampling chives and basil, their hands are busy and their senses are engaged ...what makes City Sprouts most effective (and exceptional) is that it is collaborative and flexible by design.” Boston’s rise in the national urban farming movement also has helped to make locally grown produce more available to low-income residents. Leah Shafer recalls that she was able to use food stamps at a farmer’s market to receive half-off of her purchases of kale, blueberries, and more. “It made it possible for me to buy organic, local produce that I otherwise just wouldn’t have been able to afford. I don’t think I would have been able to support local farmers without that discount,” she says.

The clean energy industry, consumer groups and conservationists all blamed federal government actions, like reviewing the renewable energy target and maintaining the policy of axing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, despite the bills axing them being blocked by the Senate. In the most recent data from the 2014-2015 financial year, 5,100 full-time equivalent jobs had gone from the sector since the 2011-2012 financial year, a drop of 27%, leaving 14,020 people working in the industry. However, the ABS said that was still an increase from the 11,520 recorded for 2009-2010. Mark Lound, ABS director of environmental statistics, said the Employment in Renewable Energy Activities publication examines levels of employment in renewable energy by state and territory and by type of renewable energy activities. “Solar energy (including roof-top solar PV, solar hot water and large scale solar PV) is the most significant source of employment among renewable energy activities,” he said. “In 2014-15 annual [full-time equivalent] employment in solar was 8,310 or 59% of total employment in renewable energy activities. Employment in solar energy peaked at 14,350 in 2011-12.” South Australia saw the most significant drop as a proportion of their total jobs, with a 60% decrease over the four years. Western Australia was next, with a 51% decrease, followed by Queensland with a 36% drop. The drops in those states were slightly offset by small increases in employment in the industry in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the ACT. Employment in the industry remained roughly steady in Tasmania. The figures were “disappointing but not surprising” said Kelly O’Shanassy, CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation. “The federal government sets the tone for the nation and this government has not been supportive of clean energy,” she said. “The government dragged out negotiations over the renewable energy target while attempting to cut the target and has had Australia’s primary renewable energy agency, Arena, on the chopping block for this entire parliamentary term ... This is no way to instil confidence in the sector. “Unfortunately the federal government continues to throw its weight behind last century’s energy sources, approving massive new coal mines like Adani’s Carmichael mine, proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland.” Solar Citizens, a solar energy consumer group, said the figures showed Turnbull “must move from rhetoric to action”. “The Australian renewable industry is still being held back by uncertainty over government policy and investment,” said the Solar Citizens national director, Claire O’Rourke. Kane Thornton, CEO of the Clean Energy Council the peak body for the clean energy industry in Australia, said it was a tough period for the industry, during a review of the renewable energy target but said there’s been an uplift since the Paris agreement and since Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott. Thornton said when the next set of figures comes out, they would show an increase in jobs in the sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2015/oct/02/lack-of-electricity-locks-people-in-poverty-low-carbon-energy-is-the-key","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-02T13:44:21Z","webTitle":"Lack of electricity locks people in poverty – low-carbon energy is the key | Mafalda Duarte","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/02/lack-of-electricity-locks-people-in-poverty-low-carbon-energy-is-the-key","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/oct/02/lack-of-electricity-locks-people-in-poverty-low-carbon-energy-is-the-key","fields":{"headline":"Lack of electricity locks people in poverty – low-carbon energy is the key","bodyText":"Steam billows from an energy plant in a stretch of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley, about 180km north of the capital, Nairobi. But the white clouds rising from the tidy grid of pipes aren’t a sign of polluting greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. They are a signal that the country of more than 44 million, where some 65% of the population does not have access to electricity, is one giant step closer to delivering clean, reliable, renewable power to its people. The first phase of the $746m Menengai geothermal development project is well under way, with already proven steam resources capable of generating 130 megawatts of electricity and working toward commissioning the first power plants in 2016. At its full 400MW potential, the project aims to provide stable, low-cost power to about 500,000 households and 300,000 businesses, and avoid nearly 2m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The expansion of Menengai is just one of many projects the government is pursuing as part of its plan to generate 5,500MW of geothermal power by 2031. Kenya’s current geothermal capacity is 595MW, but the ministry of energy estimates the country has the potential to produce about 10,000MW. Across Africa and around the world, low-carbon renewable energy is emerging as the go-to green growth and poverty reduction strategy. Kenya’s neighbours Ethiopia and Tanzania are also pursuing geothermal power, while countries in the Middle East and north Africa are focusing their efforts on expanding solar power. Still others are exploring mini-grid and off-grid solutions in wind and solar to supply the poorest and hardest-to-reach rural communities. More than 1 billion people worldwide still lack access to electricity that could enable them to light their homes, cook or pump clean water. During my 15 years working in development in Africa and Asia, and now at the helm of Climate Investment Funds, I have seen how a lack of electricity handcuffs poor families to poverty – especially women and girls, who have to gather fuel and carry out the household chores. The success of every one of the 17 sustainable development goals, formally adopted at the UN in September, depends on a swell of renewable, sustainable and affordable energy. The greatest barrier facing Kenya and other developing countries is a lack of funding to develop their renewable energy potential. Renewable energy plants are expensive to build. But once they are up and running, they can deliver cheap flows of energy. Reaching that point, however, takes millions of dollars in investment that most poor countries cannot easily access. One way to surmount this barrier is to provide countries with the starter funds they need to get their renewable energy operations off the ground, supported by policies that inspire confidence and growth. Once countries have made progress, they can more easily convince new investors to chip in, especially from the private sector. Climate Investment Funds has provided $25m in concessional financing for Menengai in Kenya to help cover exploratory drilling – a critical but risky stage of development and a cost that most private investors are unwilling to bear. In fact, the company has earmarked $810m to advance geothermal power projects in 15 countries. This could potentially yield 3.5GW of new geothermal capacity, more than a quarter of current global installed capacity of almost 13 GW. Prospects are promising, and more than $10bn is expected from other financiers. This is a start, but so much more must be done to make geothermal and other renewable energy markets viable in developing countries. The risks are high, but so are the rewards if forward-thinking countries like Kenya and early investors, like Climate Investment Funds, are willing to lay the groundwork. Meeting the ambitious targets set in the SDGs, and fulfilling the commitments each country makes in a hoped-for global agreement after UN climate talks this winter, means developing countries have to advance along a low-carbon pathway. For the good of our planet and our people, we must invest in this progress.

Forty-eight hours before the news broke, I was on the phone trying to sort out my own little crisis. Last week I transferred a not inconsiderable sum of money from one account to another – both mine, but with different banks. It’s precisely the sort of everyday administrative pain in the arse that online banking has revolutionised: click, confirm, done. The money promptly disappeared from one account – and singularly failed to materialise in the other. I waited a day. Then another. When nothing changed, I rang the first bank to make a polite inquiry about the anomaly. After checking I had input all the numbers correctly, the man on the helpline said there was nothing more he could do – I needed to speak to the other bank. To me he sounded like an airline spokesman explaining why a plane that has vanished off the radar is actually the responsibility of the destination airport. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the helpline woman at my other bank didn’t really feel like taking responsibility for a transaction she had absolutely no record of. At this point I started to get a cold, fluttery feeling in my chest. Shuffling money around cyberspace – what had made me think that would work? The helpline woman suggested I call the first bank and ask them to put a forward trace on the money, or something. The first bank transferred me around a bit before telling me I needed to update my security settings in order to proceed further. I patiently followed instructions for changing my password to one with more numbers in it, all the while resisting the urge to shout “WHERE’S MY MONEY, MAN?” into the phone. Eventually I achieved a security clearance sufficient for them to confess they had held up my transaction on purpose because it seemed so out of character. I got a letter to that effect three days later. Solar confusion Way down the US election ballot, below Clinton and Trump, there were also all manner of local referendums to be voted on. From legalising pot to reinstating the death penalty, this is how a lot of state laws are made in America these days. You may have lately become acquainted with the notion that a referendum is a pure expression of the people’s will – preferable to representative democracy – but in most cases that depends on the relative clarity or opacity of the question being asked. Should you ever need a startling example of the latter, look to Florida. Florida’s amendment 1 promised to guarantee residents’ constitutional right to own solar panels. Sounds great. But a second part of the amendment – its true purpose, cynics might say, since the measure is supported by big power utilities – relieves residents who don’t produce solar energy from the obligation to subsidise its production. In other (less weasly) words, it would end the solar panel owner’s automatic right to sell surplus electricity back to the grid. So, yes or no to solar, voter? Quickly, there’s a queue. Glimpsed in the black mirror I experienced another sort of cyberattack this week, when Facebook dropped a picture of me “7 years ago” into my timeline, asking if I wanted to Share it. No thanks. It’s just me, sitting at my desk, staring into the webcam. I don’t even remember taking it. It felt like an invasion of privacy, although my main reaction was one of denial: that was never seven years ago. I didn’t own that shirt seven years ago. I didn’t look like that seven years ago. I was young seven years ago. That old man in the picture: that’s what I look like now. I stared at it, disbelieving, until my screen went dark, and I got a quick reflective glimpse of what I really look like now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2017/mar/14/british-scientists-us-climate-change-research-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-14T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"British scientists face a ‘huge hit’ if the US cuts climate change research","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/14/british-scientists-us-climate-change-research-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/mar/14/british-scientists-us-climate-change-research-trump","fields":{"headline":"British scientists face a ‘huge hit’ if the US cuts climate change research","bodyText":"UK scientists are warning they may be unable to carry out crucial research on climate change if Donald Trump cuts climate science funding in the US. Trump tweeted in 2014 that research on global warming is “very expensive bullshit” that “has to stop”. Scientists are braced to find out whether his administration will put these words into practice. The early signs are not good. Last month Scott Pruitt, one of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s fiercest critics, was named as its new head. There are rumours that the budget of its office for research could be cut by more than 40% as part of extensive overall cuts. Meanwhile there are reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of America’s leading climate science agencies, could have its budget cut by nearly 20%. The agency’s satellite division, a vital source of data for climate research, is expected to bear the brunt of cuts. British scientists say moves to squeeze funding of climate-related research in the US – and of facilities at government laboratories in particular – could be disastrous for work in the UK. And they say Trump’s travel ban is already harming their collaboration with scientists in America, with some researchers pulling out of commitments in the UK because of fears they may not make it back through US visa controls. Prof Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, says: “Everything we do is international, and we particularly rely on American satellite data. Perhaps we could manage if other areas were cut – perhaps the Chinese or the Indians might even step in to fill the gaps – but we would definitely miss the satellite data from the US.” Haigh uses satellite data to study how the sun influences the Earth’s climate. She is helping to disentangle the effect of natural fluctuations in solar energy from those of manmade greenhouse gases – and she is clear that global warming cannot be attributed to the sun or other natural processes. “At Imperial we use NOAA satellite data for many important climate studies. For example, it can tell us how much of the sun’s energy the Earth absorbs, how much heat energy it emits and how these values depend on other factors, particularly cloud cover.” She says cutting the NOAA’s budget would be a “huge hit” not only for science, but also for our understanding of the weather. “They are trying to get rid of everything that could be badged as climate change. But to understand the climate you need to measure the weather. You can’t separate the two. Whether you are on a climate change ‘bandwagon’ is irrelevant.” Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at Leeds University, says: “If organisations like Nasa and the NOAA are prohibited from putting up new satellites, that could be really detrimental for the entire international science community. We urgently need these data sets to be able to monitor and understand climate change.” Like many scientists Forster fears a cull across a number of US government laboratories concerned with climate change. “Our one biggest concern is the loss of raw talent,” he says. “The loss of people we collaborate with and the people producing this data that we rely on.” He says the Trump administration is already making scientific collaboration across the Atlantic more difficult. “Quite a lot of the academics we work with in America are immigrants and some of them are concerned about leaving the country in case they don’t get back in. We’ve certainly seen instances where people have pulled out of coming to scientific conferences. Four or five people I know of, speakers and so forth, have pulled out of their commitments to come here.” In a recent example a key scientist from Princeton University pulled out of a climate change workshop that Forster co-organised at Imperial College London. American research fellow Dr Sarah Batterman moved to Leeds University to work on tropical forests and climate change a year ago after doing postdoctoral research at Princeton. She is in regular contact with colleagues in the US and says: “The situation for people doing climate-related science in the US is really scary. There is so much uncertainty. I think people are trying to keep their heads down and keep their research going as much as they can until they see what is going to happen.” Batterman works closely with scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, a US government laboratory in Panama, and is concerned about whether its funding will continue. “My research wouldn’t be possible without the Smithsonian facilities. So for me this isn’t just something that is happening at a distance,” she explains. For Prof Rosalind Cornforth, director of the Walker Institute at Reading University, the anxiety about the US pulling the plug on climate science is somewhat different. Her institute works with governments and scientists in some of the world’s most fragile, conflict-affected countries, applying climate science to solve real-world problems. “So many of our fellow climate scientists from developing countries rely on access to climate data sets available in the US,” she says. “If these become restricted in the future, there would be repercussions on vital capacity development for places like Africa.” There is one potential silver lining for UK universities in this cloud of uncertainty. Vice-chancellors at some leading universities said last week they hoped to be able to woo some big-name climate scientists from across the Atlantic. Forster, whose institute is only a year old and is recruiting staff, says: “I have just got back from a trip to America to talk to people. Many scientists think it is too early to leave. They don’t know quite what Trump will do, and there is even some optimism that perhaps he won’t survive a four-year term. But they are definitely interested in talking to us about possibilities.” Prof Paul Ekins, director of University College London’s Institute for Sustainable Resources, says many climate scientists may feel forced to leave the US if conditions worsen. “If you are in a science field that depends on expensive equipment, like climate science research from space, and you can’t get that kit because the funding dries up, you can’t do anything. This is applied, practical work trying to understand what is happening to the climate. US scientists may well hope that things will change with the future administration, but they may not want to write off four to eight years of their productive lives.” However, some climate scientists point out that with Brexit looming Britain may struggle to present itself as a place of calm and stability from which to escape Trump. Batterman says: “I think early career researchers who are looking for jobs may be considering options abroad. But there is also a lot of uncertainty in the UK too, because we don’t know what is going to happen with funding after the UK leaves the EU.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/mar/10/virtual-ring-i-thee-wed-how-to-wedding-virtual-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-10T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"With this virtual ring, I thee wed ... how to tie the knot in VR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/mar/10/virtual-ring-i-thee-wed-how-to-wedding-virtual-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2017/mar/10/virtual-ring-i-thee-wed-how-to-wedding-virtual-reality","fields":{"headline":"With this virtual ring, I thee wed ... how to tie the knot in VR","bodyText":"Anyone who has planned a wedding knows the effort involved. Choosing a venue, whittling down the guestlist, writing vows, picking a colour scheme … the to-do list goes on. Remarkably, for Cardiff couple Martin Shervington and Elisa Evans, who are holding their ceremony in virtual reality in May, the list looks much the same – that is, if you don’t count the two robot avatars they’ve chosen to represent themselves as they say their vows, one pink and one blue. The wedding will take place at a virtual nightclub called the Spire, complete with a red mottled sky and lava lake. Shervington and Evans have invited 150 of their friends and family to attend – many of whom wouldn’t have been able to make it to a real-life wedding in Cardiff. More and more couples are hiring companies to record their big day using 360-degree video, but a ceremony in virtual reality has only happened once before. In 1994, a San Francisco couple, Monika and Hugh Jo, were married on the island of Atlantis. The software required reportedly would have cost $1m (£820,000), but was covered by the VR company Monika worked for, CyberMind. Hosting Shervington and Evans’s ceremony is San Francisco-based social VR platform AltspaceVR. Founder Eric Romo says the idea of a virtual reality wedding did not come as a surprise to him: “I thought it was perfect. This is exactly [...] the sort of thing we think is a really good use of the technology. What we’re trying to do is bring people together and make them feel connected in a way that we can’t on a phone call or video chat.” The virtual and augmented reality market has grown substantially since 2010, when American teenager Palmer Luckey created the first VR headset prototype, which evolved into the Oculus Rift. Two years later, Mark Zuckerberg bought the company for $2bn. Sony, Playstation and Samsung have all brought out their own headsets since. But the majority of VR’s fans and product developers have come from the gaming sector. Romo is an exception. A mechanical engineer by trade, he was one of the first employees at SpaceX – the private firm that recently announced it is committed to sending two citizens to the moon in 2018 – before leaving to study an MBA at Stanford University. He later started his own solar technology company in 2006. “That was an interesting journey for me,” he says. “[The business] went from two guys and a white board trying to figure out what they might want to do with solar energy, to raising $120m in venture capital, having 100 employees and manufacturing operations in China.” He wound up the business in 2012 after “everybody except the Chinese manufacturers went out of business,” an experience that he admits “was less fun”. But it was in the downturn of 2010–11 that his interest was piqued by virtual reality technologies and he started reading up on it in his spare time. “The idea of connecting in virtual spaces has been around as long as people have been working on computers, basically,” Romo says. “We don’t believe you’re going to turn people who aren’t interested in games into gamers because of VR. But the idea that I can connect with my friends and family all over the world, in a deeper way [than previously possible], we think that resonates with everybody.” VR technology is already being trialled by healthcare professionals to treat conditions such as Alzheimer’s; Munich-based startup Icaros is attempting to revolutionise the fitness industry; and experts are exploring VR’s potential to train workers in industries where accidents are common, such as the NHS, aviation and the military. On a more basic level, Romo holds weekly meetings in VR and has found it a particularly useful medium when there are multiple people speaking. “With VR, like in real life, you have the ability to make eye contact, to gesture, the ability to point at something, or to turn and look at the person who’s speaking. Those things that are really subtle and simple, and that just happen when you’re together. “On a phone or video call, all we can do is talk. I can’t hand you something [as I can in VR]. If you think about how you connect with someone in real life, often there are physical objects or media that facilitates your communication.” Despite the growing fascination with the industry, the number of users is still low – an estimated 43m worldwide – and sales of virtual reality headsets in 2016 were far lower than anticipated. Playstation VR, for example, was expected to sell 2.6m units but dropped this to 750,000. Consultants Digi-Capital had originally anticipated that the augmented and virtual reality sector would reach $150bn by 2020 (with VR accounting for $30bn of that), but in January 2017 downgraded its forecast to $108bn by 2021 (VR accounting for $25bn). Romo won’t disclose how many users AltspaceVR has but says they cover 150 countries. His figures show participants are typically engaged for 15–20 minutes on mobile devices compared with an average of just three to four minutes on non-social VR platforms. He believes that the restrictive nature of the available hardware – particularly the need for a high-powered desktop to run the programmes – has held back the widespread adoption of the technology. Beyond weddings, AltspaceVR has been involved with some interesting initiatives – it’s hosted an international film festival, held concerts and art shows in VR, and a comedy show with comedian Reggie Watts and actor Justin Roiland. Events are currently free but Romo sees the potential for organisers to charge in the future. AltspaceVR’s Frontrow technology makes it seem as though there are only around 30 people there, even if there are a thousand in attendance, so everyone can get close to the performers. So what does the future hold for VR? Will we all be getting married, holding business meetings and watching entertainment together in a virtual space? Romo won’t be drawn into making predictions. “People who tend to work in this space tend to come with a lot of sci-fi baggage. They’ve read all these sci-fi novels and have this vision they’ve been dreaming about for the last 30 years of what virtual reality should be that guides their product design and their idea of what is going to be fulfilling for people.” A better approach, suggests Romo, is trial and error. “The right way to find out is to test and experiment and get people using it. I’m most proud of our passion for experimentation – getting things in front of people as quickly as possible and then finding out if it’s good. We’re often really surprised at what good looks like.” Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/apr/13/vermont-maple-syrup-industry-new-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-13T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Sweet science: Vermont maple syrup industry embraces hi-tech tricks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/13/vermont-maple-syrup-industry-new-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/apr/13/vermont-maple-syrup-industry-new-technology","fields":{"headline":"Sweet science: Vermont maple syrup industry embraces hi-tech tricks","bodyText":"The late March wind tugs at the jackets of Mooretown Elementary students as they clamber after Burr Morse into a wooden sugar shack. Morse, 70, is taking a break from preparing for open house weekend, the annual Vermont maple free-for-all, where 94 farms will open their doors to the public, offering sugar-on-snow, sleigh rides, and maple treats. The sap is temporarily frozen, but sugarers are anticipating potential flow over the weekend, when the temperatures hit a high of 40 degrees. They’ll extract it using high-tech reverse osmosis machines, refine it at a level three times as efficient as a 2004 farm, and power the whole facility using wind power, solar energy and cow manure. The industry’s gains in efficiency have even offset a problem creeping up on all agriculture: climate change, which is shortening the sugaring season. The Vermont sugar industry predates European colonists, and in its current iteration is both folksy and hi-tech. Farmers across the state man their posts by expensive evaporators and thousands of miles of plastic piping from snowbound trees to the warmth of smoking sugar houses. Sugaring was a tradition started by Native American tribes and carried on by Vermont settlers who couldn’t afford processed white sugar at their general stores. Two hundred years later, it continues as a booming industry. Morse Farm Seventy years ago, Morse’s grandparents moved their dairy and maple production down the road to the current farm, but the old wooden structure stands as a reminder of the farming his family has done on hundreds of acres since the 1790s. When his father sold all of the family Jersey cattle in 1966, the Morses turned to sugaring entirely, increasing their tapping from 3,000 trees to 5,000 in 2014. Morse and his son Tom, 36, have worked to modernize the farm with reverse osmosis machines, and oil-fired evaporators that expedite the process far beyond the old method of tapping a tree and leaving a bucket hanging to collect sap. Now, 5/16-inch tubing brings sap from thousands of trees to the small sugarhouse, outlining the white snow like blue-green capillaries, and saving farmers from the task of loading hundreds of gallons of sap onto pickup trucks. Afterward, a reverse osmosis machine reduces the sap’s water content, and evaporator starts the boiling. “We bring it from 2% sugar content when the sap comes out of the tree,” explains Morse. “We get it there in a reverse osmosis machine. Then in an evaporator to get it to 66% sugar content.” The evaporator removes water from the sap before boiling increasing the sugar level, and the liquid is filtered and bottled. Boiling sap once took over 12 hours – now, it can be done as quickly as 30 minutes for a batch. When sugarers go green Chris Trudeau, 24, watches sap boil in a $100,000 evaporator. On a good day, it can process 140 gallons of syrup an hour. Trudeau’s extended family, the Harrisons, own Georgia Mountain Maples, and he works there with 26 other full-time and seasonal employees. In December, he spent a month with other workers individually tapping the 120,000 trees on the 2,000-acre property, a large mountain in the middle of Milton. Trudeau said: “I’ve been here since the start of it. I used to do buckets in high school.” Sap comes in through 500 miles of tubing to a reverse osmosis machine, into 9,500-gallon concrete holding tanks, then into the evaporator that Trudeau oversees. After being filtered, the syrup is barreled and poured into containers. Shannon, Kevin, and Cathy Harrison opened Georgia Mountain Maples six years ago. Unlike the Morses, they sell wholesale. The Harrisons’ concrete company has 100 employees. When it’s offseason for concrete, they switch over some of the staff to the sugarhouse to ensure they won’t have to be laid off. Sugarers use everything from tree taps to submersible pumps to maple cream-making machines in the 21st-century iteration of their business, and Georgia Mountain Maples uses the Georgia Mountain Community wind farm, which sends power from its 10-megawatt wind turbines back into the grid. There’s a solar component, too: “Our solar project creates enough to offset our bills,” Kevin Harrison explained. The farm itself runs on gas, purchasing “cow power” through Green Mountain Power Company, which converts methane from cow manure into fuel. Fourteen farms and 13,500 cows are part of the program, creating 73,000 tons of methane – the equivalent of burning more than 8.2m gallons of gas. Cow power powers 3,200 Vermont homes. Does all of this interest in cheap energy speak to concern about the effects of climate change? It depends on who you ask; clean power is also cheap and efficient power. Harrison said, “We made a lot of syrup in January and February, but then again, it’s only a week or two, then a stop. I don’t know what normal is anymore. It’s definitely about temperature.” In 2017, for the first time many Vermont sugarers were tapping in January due to mild temperatures. With every shift in temperature comes the high price of shutting down operations only to start up again every few weeks. Despite the earlier sugaring times, the maple season is three days shorter than it has been in the past, according to the Proctor Maple Research Center at the University of Vermont. Fifteen years ago, this would have meant a 10% smaller crop, or a major economic hit, but technology has increased yields so significantly that a briefer season is not yet a problem. New technology Although most sugarers admit that human-caused climate change exists, they don’t seem to think it is influencing them. Most farm owners mentioned the change in the season starting as their indicator that “something is off”. But if anything is amiss, it appears to be benefiting them. Timothy Perkins, director of the Proctor Maple Research Center, said: “It’s hard to say if anything is happening in one year. What we’ve seen in the past 50 is the season changing, and happening earlier in the calendar year.” He does believe that improved sap collection techniques and sanitation have improved sugaring and increased yields because they take the trees into consideration. He explained, “trees are like all living organisms; they don’t want infections. When you drill, you create a wound. For people, we develop a scab, then the wound is healed. Trees internally wall off that wound to spread infection from spreading into tree from microbes in the tap hole.” The typical maple tree tap generates .2 gallons of syrup over time, an average Proctor Center has tripled in a 13-year average to .6 gallons. Meanwhile, local news stations are buzzing about new technology that will decrease the time, cost, and amount of energy it takes to make a gallon of syrup. Usually, it takes four gallons of oil to produce a single gallon of syrup. With new a new kind of high “brix” (sugar concentration) reverse osmosis machine and evaporator, it only takes 0.18 gallons. Of course, new technology is always expensive. Farmers are worried the expedited process might change the flavor of syrup. The Proctor Center has been testing samples from Canadian maple farms, and also tried blind taste tests with consumers. “We have taste panels, some from the high brix machine, and some from normal production. People couldn’t tell the difference. We are perfectly convinced it makes good syrup.” This article was amended on 17 April 2017 to clarify that wind turbines power Georgia Mountain Maples, not Morse Farm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-08T19:14:56Z","webTitle":"'Clean' coal won't be commercially viable before 2030, energy analysis says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","fields":{"headline":"'Clean' coal won't be commercially viable before 2030, energy analysis says","bodyText":"“Clean” coal technologies won’t be commercially viable before 2030 without government subsidy and are fundamentally out of sync with the move towards more flexible power generation, according to the energy market analysis firm RepuTex. In a new analysis released on Thursday, RepuTex argues that the rising price of gas, coupled with the falling cost of energy storage, has now made renewable energy the cheapest source of reliable power generation in Australia. The long lead time before technologies such as carbon capture and storage reach commercial maturity means “clean” coal won’t help Australia meet its 2030 emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement. RepuTex used its submission to the Finkel review to argue that a market signal was required to determine the value of abatement and to allow an orderly retirement of ageing coal-fired generators. The firm said the market signal could take the form of an emissions intensity scheme, a legislated emissions benchmark, cap, or target that “better links emissions reduction objectives to the operation of the Australian electricity system”. While the debate accompanying the Finkel review has centred on the electricity industry, RepuTex pointed out energy was not the only source of low-cost emissions reduction potential in the Australian economy. “Outside of the generation sector, the effort to reduce emissions could therefore be spread across the economy,” the firm said. “This may be achieved via the design of sectoral targets for industrial emitters via the safeguard mechanism, supported by emissions offsets, which would enable companies to reduce emissions at lower cost, while incentivising investment in cleaner, more efficiency energy technology.” The call by RepuTex for a clear market signal follows similar arguments mounted by the National Farmers’ Federation, which this week reversed its once-vociferous opposition to carbon pricing. Other major organisation to champion a market mechanism include Energy Networks Australia, the retailer EnergyAustralia, the electricity provider AGL, the Climate Change Authority, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Business Council of Australia and the CSIRO. The official conducting the energy review, the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, gave implicit support for an emissions intensity scheme in his preliminary report, saying it would integrate best “with the electricity market’s pricing and risk management framework” and “had the lowest economic costs and the lowest impact on electricity prices”. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, initially signalled the government would look at the desirability of an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector as part of its scheduled review of its Direct Action climate policy – but he reversed his position after an internal Coalition revolt. A major stakeholder in Australia’s politically toxic carbon pricing debate, the Minerals Council of Australia, has used its submission to rebuke Finkel for floating an intensity scheme in his preliminary report without detailed analysis of the costs. While the MCA doesn’t rule out supporting such a scheme, noting it is appropriate to consider all policy options, it says Finkel conducted “virtually no serious analysis of the economic costs”. The council, which represents Australia’s mining giants, says modelling “relied upon by the independent review shows the costs of an EIS are very high”. “For example, close analysis of one of the cited reports … shows the total additional cost to household and industry of an EIS configured around Australia’s contribution to a 2 degrees limit on global warming would reach $128bn over the period 2020 to 2030,” the submission says. “That is a fact germane to the broader national policy debate. At the very least, the independent review should be more transparent about these costs in its final report.” The MCA blasts Finkel’s preliminary report on a range of fronts, declaring it “conspicuously fails to examine the comparable costs of available energy sources” – declaring this “an extraordinary omission for a report of this kind”. The council uses figures dating from 2015 to argue that coal and gas technologies remain the lowest cost to build and operate. It asserts the review ignored the potential contribution of high-efficiency, low-emissions (HELE) coal technologies and ignored the potential of nuclear power. The MCA submission contains new research arguing that electricity networks face significant integration costs as the relative share of wind and solar energy rises – including the requirement to keep backup generation power on standby. The research says the direct subsidies paid by electricity consumers to achieve the large-scale component of the renewable energy target “are estimated at more than $1.8bn in 2016 alone but these subsidies only represent a fraction of the costs of this policy”. The research by the consultancy BAEconomics says integration costs increase significantly as the share of intermittent generation capacity in a power system rises. The MCA argues the costs associated with intermittent capacity should be borne by renewable generators. It also argues the government should provide support “to all energy sources or to none”. It declares that the final Finkel report must make a “clear and unambiguous statement in favour” of a technology-neutral approach to policy support for both CCS and HELE coal technologies – meaning the rules should be changed to allow the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in “clean” coal. The CEFC has said clean coal plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agrees to indemnify projects against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced, and against the cost of delays prompted by likely community protest action. In its submission to the Finkel review, the CEFC noted there was no new coal-fired capacity among current proposals registered with the Australian Energy Market Operator. “Coal-fired generation tends to be relatively inflexible and not suited to a market with higher levels of renewable energy penetration and declines in daytime demand as a result of rooftop solar generation,” the CEFC said. “While the range of cost estimates for new coal-fired generation capacity are broadly comparable with new renewable energy capacity (excluding any cost for carbon emissions), negative investor perceptions mean that new investment in coal-fired capacity would be unlikely to be financed by Australian or international capital markets. “Investors perceive that new fossil-fuel generation capacity has carbon risk, which is the risk that a new asset would be stranded if a future government were to adopt tighter emissions constraints. “Further, there is arguably no longer a social licence for new coal-fired power stations in Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2016/nov/18/africa-tired-being-in-dark-bank-chief-plans-boost-energy-akinwumi-adesina-cop22","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-18T14:07:27Z","webTitle":"‘Africa is tired of being in the dark’: bank chief on plans to boost energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/18/africa-tired-being-in-dark-bank-chief-plans-boost-energy-akinwumi-adesina-cop22","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2016/nov/18/africa-tired-being-in-dark-bank-chief-plans-boost-energy-akinwumi-adesina-cop22","fields":{"headline":"‘Africa is tired of being in the dark’: bank chief on plans to boost energy","bodyText":"“We lose 5% of our potential GDP every year, and African industries cannot be competitive without access to electricity,” says Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank. “I believe that’s why we can’t break away from reliance on exporting our raw materials – new industries will only go to where there’s power.” He is speaking on the sidelines of the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, which ends on Friday. Adesina and colleagues from the bank have been using the conference to highlight its new initiatives on energy, including the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which will see $12bn (£9.7bn) invested in the sector over the next five years. “Africa is tired of being in the dark,” he says. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has also created the role of vice-president on power, and been a major player in setting up the African Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to generate 10GW of power from renewable sources by 2020 and up to 300GW by 2030. “This initiative was the major outcome for Africa of the Paris COP21 meeting last year, where G7 countries contributed $10bn towards it,” says Adesina. Adesina says he is particularly impressed by the strides Morocco has taken to develop its capacity for solar energy. The AfDB was a major investor in the 160MW Noor solar plant at Ouarzazate, which was opened this year. The complex, which uses giant mirrors to reflect the sun’s heat on to liquid that then turns turbines, is being expanded to produce more than 500MW by 2018. Morocco has also recently signed a deal to build 1720MW in new wind farm capacity. “Africa should use what it has and not what it doesn’t have. We have limitless sunshine and great potential for wind, hydro and geothermal,” he says. However, he still believes there is a role for non-renewable sources of energy in Africa. “We need a balanced energy mix. Some African countries have gas and coal, which can be used in a clean way, and they should use it.” Another major challenge is to increase the amount of money spent on climate change adaptation – or helping countries to rebuild systems when they are destroyed by the impacts of climate change. In Africa, for example, governments are coping with floods, extreme temperatures and major droughts in east and southern Africa and the Sahel. Wealthy countries have committed $100bn towards helping poorer states cope with climate change, but one of the major topics on the agenda in Marrakech has been how that money should be divided between adaptation and mitigation. Until now, only 14% of climate funds have gone to adaptation, and Africa, the continent most deeply affected by climate change, has received only 4% of the total green climate funds. “We’ve been short-changed by climate change and we should not be short-changed in financing,” says Adesina. “South Africa has spent $700m this year dealing with the impacts of the drought last year; Mozambique $200m; Namibia $13m. These emergency costs are continuously displacing public expenditure which should be going to health, education and infrastructure development, and endangering macro-economic stability. My view is that we need to increase the amount to be spent on adaptation so that we can spend money on development.” The AfDB is trying to garner support for an African insurance fund. An initiative called the African Risk Capacity Insurance has been launched, but of 32 countries that signed up, only seven have been able to pay the premiums. Adesina says the idea for the insurance fund was welcomed on Wednesday at an African heads of state meeting chaired by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, and that one way in which climate finance can be better targeted to help African countries is for green climate funds such as the GEF (Global Environment Facility) to start paying the premiums for the African countries. He hopes that this could pave the way for action. “Whenever these drastic climate events like drought, flood or extreme temperature happen, the world has words of comfort for Africa,” says Adesina. “But words of comfort cannot pay the bills and rebuild when problems start.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jul/02/america-solar-power-workforce-growing-market-solarcity-suniva","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-02T15:00:04Z","webTitle":"A good job if you can get it: America's solar workforce is heating up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/02/america-solar-power-workforce-growing-market-solarcity-suniva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/02/america-solar-power-workforce-growing-market-solarcity-suniva","fields":{"headline":"A good job if you can get it: America's solar workforce is heating up","bodyText":"Antwain Nelson held various jobs in the construction field for several years, but the work never felt fulfilling. Then an opportunity to volunteer in low-income neighborhoods introduced him to his current job and, he says, a clear career path. “The first day, I fell in love with it,” says Nelson, 25, an installer of solar energy systems and a lifelong resident of Washington DC. The people he works with, he says, feel “like another family to me”. Nelson is one of thousands of new hires in the US solar industry, which has become the fastest growing sector in the energy business. Solar employment has more than doubled since 2010, reaching 209,000 employees by November 2015, according to The Solar Foundation, a nonprofit that offers research and educational programs to promote solar. The industry created about 35,000 of those jobs in 2015 alone. In a report released in November, the foundation projects another 30,000 new jobs through the end of 2016 – a 14.7% annual increase, or 13 times faster than the overall economy. The rise in solar employment comes as jobs in the coal industry are declining sharply. There are reports of some former coal workers transitioning to new jobs in solar. But this may not be possible for the whole sector, as the top coal-producing states have not been hotbeds of solar development. Coal states such as Wyoming, West Virginia and Kentucky don’t even rank among the top 35 states for solar installations over the past two years, according to GTM Research. The top three states with the most solar jobs, from manufacturing to retail, are California, Massachusetts and Nevada, the foundation says. Unsurprisingly, job growth is taking place in states that offer generous rebates and other incentives for producing and installing solar energy equipment. The solar market is largely growing on the backs of workers who hoist solar panels up to roofs to assemble and wire them together. More than half of the solar jobs nationwide involve installation, says Andrea Luecke, the foundation’s executive director. Manufacturing is the second largest job category, which may seem surprising given that the majority of the solar panels being installed in the US come from China. But there has been a rise in domestic manufacturing, which reflects the growing demand from within the US and the impact of the tariffs that the Obama administration imposed on Chinese-made solar panels in recent years. The government put tariffs in place after determining that Chinese manufacturers were selling their products at below fair-market value. The country’s largest solar installer also is becoming a major manufacturer. SolarCity is building what will become the nation’s largest solar panel manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York. The company expects the new plant, which is set for completion later this year, to create 1,460 new full-time jobs. Other manufacturers with expansion plans include Suniva, which announced plans last September to grow its Norcross, Georgia, panel manufacturing plant and create about 500 new jobs. “The employers that we surveyed were very bullish and said we’ve had a couple of rough years but we’re planning to invest in our workforce and we’re growing,” Luecke says. That growth has come with jobs that offer good pay. Installers earn a median pay of $21 per hour, the foundation says, while factory assemblers earn a median of $18 per hour. Both are above the national median pay of $17.04 per hour for all jobs. But one of the biggest challenges posed to this new and growing market is finding qualified workers. Luecke says solar employers are able to draw workers from a variety of construction and manufacturing fields because they require employees with many of the same basic skills learned in other areas of hands-on work, from oilfield laborers to home builders. Even so, about 20% of employers polled by the foundation said it was “very difficult” to find qualified employees in 2015, a slight increase from the prior year. “What employers are looking for is experience – somebody who has been up on a roof before, has worked with electrical systems before, has been on some kind of construction crew, can follow directions and safety protocol,” she says. Nelson got into solar through a career training program offered by Sasha Bruce Youthwork, a Washington DC nonprofit that helps inner city young people lead more stable lives. In 2014, it brought a group of volunteers to help a project by Grid Alternatives, a nonprofit energy company that builds solar projects for low-income families. After gaining more training through a fellowship from Grid, the nonprofit promoted him to a full-time position on the installation team two months ago. “I feel as though I’m headed down a good path, and it’s fun,” says Nelson. “Being able to put solar on another person’s roof is great, because you’re saving them money. I love the mission.” Some employers also actively recruit military veterans, knowing that there has been a flood of them entering the workforce after America’s long military interventions in the Middle East. One of those is Sam Gulland, who was a captain in the 75th Ranger Regiment in the Army and served two tours in Afghanistan before leaving the military last December. A Princeton University graduate with a degree in public policy and international affairs, Gulland started talking to friends about their plans after military service, and many were interested in alternative energy. “I think vets are drawn to it because they come from work that carries lots of meaning,” Gulland says. “In general, I think clean energy carries that same kind of meaning. At some point, fossil fuels will run out. Global warming, if we don’t do something about it, could kill millions of people.” Gulland found the US Department of Energy’s Solar Ready Vets program, which connects veterans with jobs in the solar industry, and the research led him to Grid Alternatives, where he began volunteering. That was how Gulland recently found himself working alongside Nelson to install a solar energy system at a home in Washington DC in May this year. Gulland helped unload solar panels from a truck and tested the panels to ensure they produce the proper voltage before they go up onto the roof. Gulland, who is is mulling over his career move, says he’s interested in solar project development and financing. He’s currently a fellow with the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, a DC-based nonprofit that teaches about energy markets and policy analysis. It is still uncertain how long the solar employment boom will last because the industry heavily depends on government tax incentives to thrive. Congress recently extended a key tax credit for another five years, a move that provides near-term assurance to solar employers. But politics are as shifty as economics, and there are no guarantees. SolarCity and its major competitor, Sunrun, recently stopped selling and installing solar in Nevada when the state increased the fees that homeowners will have to pay to put solar panels on their roofs. Luecke says she expects solar employment to plateau within the next 10 to 20 years, partly because installers and manufacturers will become more efficient to keep costs down as they gain more experience in the market. In the meantime, there is still a lot of opportunity for growth, she says, because solar generation only accounts for 1% of America’s electricity market. “Our growth rates are high because we’re starting from a small base,” she notes. “We’re going to become more automated, using more snap-on technology, using more robotics in manufacturing. The growth will then be a lot more tempered.” The article was amended on 6 July 2016 to show that Sam Gulland is a fellow at the Clean Energy Leadership Institute. An earlier version of the story said Sam Gulland was thinking about applying for the fellowship."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/06/inside-glanrhyd-the-first-solar-eco-hamlet-in-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-06T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Inside Glanrhyd, the first solar 'eco hamlet' in Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/06/inside-glanrhyd-the-first-solar-eco-hamlet-in-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/06/inside-glanrhyd-the-first-solar-eco-hamlet-in-wales","fields":{"headline":"Inside Glanrhyd, the first solar 'eco hamlet' in Wales","bodyText":"Most of the houses in the Welsh village of Glanrhyd are of traditional construction – walls made out of hefty local stone, roofs of grey slate. They can get chilly when the winter winds whistle through the gaps. The six houses that make up the “eco hamlet” of Pentre Solar look and feel very different. They are built using light, bright timber sourced from a nearby valley. The houses are carefully insulated, airtight and powered by solar panels. Over the next few weeks the first tenants, local people from Pembrokeshire county council’s housing list, will move into what is being billed as the only development of its kind in the UK. Their fuel bills are expected to be a fraction of their neighbours’ – and they will even get the use of a shared electric car for the school run, the shopping trip to nearby Cardigan, or even for a jolly to one of the many glorious local beaches. “We are delighted with how it has turned out,” said Glen Peters, CEO of Western Solar, the company behind the scheme. “We can’t wait for people to come and start living here.” If the project, which has been backed by the Welsh government, does work, the hope is that similar developments could be rolled out across Wales and eventually across the UK. Western Solar’s first venture was a solar farm, five miles from the eco hamlet. Doubts that it was sunny enough in this part of the British Isles (after all, the nearby village of Eglwyswrw made headlines last year after it rained for more than 80 days in a row) proved unfounded and the project thrived. Peters began to think about the number of people living in fuel poverty – according to the latest UK government figures, 10% of households in England alone cannot afford to heat their homes – and remembered his own chilly childhood in south London when he and his immigrant parents shivered in front of an inadequate one-bar heater. Using technology borrowed from Germany, Western Solar built a prototype eco home called Tŷ Solar (Tŷ is Welsh for house). The idea was to produce a high-quality, brilliantly insulated, airtight house made of locally sourced timber and powered by solar energy. They liked the results and expected investors to be as excited as they were. When the investors failed to show, the company decided to build its own “solar hamlet” to showcase its ideas. It found an abandoned cowshed and was given a grant of £141,000 by the Welsh government to help turn it into a factory. Wood for the houses, larch and Douglas fir, was sourced from the Gwaun Valley and local people were hired and trained to build the homes. About 40% of the fabric of the houses is made in the factory; it takes a week to make each one and four or five days to erect it. Corners have not been cut. When the company was sourcing interior doors, its workers refused to countenance the idea of them being made of rainforest timber. “They said they would make them themselves and did – out of local Douglas fir,” said Peters. Using local materials and local labour is important. The company says every pound it spends stays in the local economy. The houses cost around £100,000 to build, which Peters says is comparable to a conventional build. A brownfield site – an old garage – was found and Pentre Solar (pentre means village) took shape. Peters said the solar panels would reduce power bills from the UK average of £1,300 a year to more like £200. “On the most grizzly winter’s day, they will have to draw power from the grid,” said Peters. It all means the houses are in high demand. Four of them have “affordable” rents and are being offered to people on Pembrokeshire county council’s housing register who have lived in the area for five years. Property can be hard to find here because so many houses have been bought up by wealthy outsiders as holiday homes. Would-be tenants can expect stringent interviews. As well as the normal financial and background checks, they have to show they buy into the ethos of the development. “These are high-performance houses,” said Peters. “You can’t just knock a hole in a wall if you feel like it – or put in a cat flap for that matter.” Western Solar’s ambitious plan is to build 1,000 more houses across the UK in the next 10 years and is looking for investors to help. The Welsh government is keen to see the concept work elsewhere. One of the key pledges of the current Labour-led administration is to provide an additional 20,000 affordable homes by 2021. After officially cutting the ribbon to open Pentre Solar on Thursday, Lesley Griffiths, the cabinet secretary for environment and rural affairs, said: “This scheme ticks so many boxes. We need more houses, we need more energy efficiency, we want to help people with fuel poverty. It’s been really good to hear how they have sourced local products. It’s great they’re using local people to build the houses.” Paul Oxborrow is one of the local young men who has become a proficient carpenter by working on the Pentre Solar homes. “It’s been brilliant,” he said. “We’ve all learned so much and the houses look great. They’re good for the people who live in them and good for the environment. I’d love to live in one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T13:13:33Z","webTitle":"Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult","fields":{"headline":"Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'","bodyText":"The man tipped as frontrunner for the role of science adviser to Donald Trump has described climate scientists as “a glassy-eyed cult” in the throes of a form of collective madness. William Happer, an eminent physicist at Princeton University, met Trump last month to discuss the post and says that if he were offered the job he would take it. Happer is highly regarded in the academic community, but many would view his appointment as a further blow to the prospects of concerted international action on climate change. “There’s a whole area of climate so-called science that is really more like a cult,” Happer told the Guardian. “It’s like Hare Krishna or something like that. They’re glassy-eyed and they chant. It will potentially harm the image of all science.” Trump has previously described global warming as “very expensive … bullshit” and has signalled a continued hardline stance since taking power. He has nominated the former Texas governor Rick Perry, a staunch climate sceptic, as secretary of energy and hopes to put the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) under the leadership of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who has been one of the agency’s most hostile critics. John Holdren, Barack Obama’s science adviser, said Happer’s outspoken opinions would be a “substantial handicap” for a job that has traditionally involved delivering mainstream scientific opinion to the heart of policymaking. “Every national academy of science agrees that the science is solid, that climate change is real,” he said. “To call this a cult is absurd and … an insult to the people who have done this work.” Happer also supports a controversial crackdown on the freedom of federal agency scientists to speak out about their findings, arguing that mixed messages on issues such as whether butter or margarine is healthier, have led to people disregarding all public health information. “So many people are fed up of listening to the government lie to them about margarine and climate change that when something is actually true and beneficial they don’t listen,” he said, citing childhood vaccines as an example. “The government should have a reputation of being completely reliable about facts – real facts.” Happer dismissed concerns that Trump is “anti-science”, saying he had a positive impression of the president during their January meeting. “He asked good questions – he was very attentive, actually,” he said. Climate change was mentioned but was not the main focus of discussions, according to Happer, who revealed that Trump had expressed support for solar energy in areas like Arizona “where it makes sense”. “His comments were that of a technically literate person,” he said. “He wasn’t ideologically opposed to renewables; he wasn’t ideologically in favour of them either.” Unlike many of his scientific peers, Happer is in favour of contentious legislation aimed at reining in the ability of federal agency staff to hold press conferences, give television interviews and promote their findings on official websites. The “Secret Science Reform Bill”, which is being pushed by the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science, space and technology Committee, would require federal agencies to publish all the raw data underpinning any proposed regulations and for new findings to be scrutinised extensively by outside experts before being announced. However, critics view the bill as an attempt to strip federal agencies of autonomy and reduce their regulatory powers. “There is this special need for government science to be especially clean and without fault,” said Happer. “It’s OK to have press conferences, but before you do that you should have the findings carefully vetted.” When asked for examples of where the current vetting process has failed, Happer cited a recent controversy surrounding a high-profile paper published by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) scientists showing that global surface temperatures had risen again after temporarily levelling off. Earlier this month, a retired Noaa scientist, John Bates, accused his former colleagues of rushing out the paper ahead of the UN conference, prioritising political impact over scientific rigour – although Bates later clarified that he had an issue with timing and transparency rather than “tampering with data”. “This disappearance of the hiatus in global warming, which was trotted out just before the [UN] Paris conference … it was clearly just a political fanfare,” said Happer. “We shouldn’t be doing that. They were fiddling with the temperature records to make the hiatus go away.” Happer argues that climate monitoring, such as the collection of CO2 and atmospheric temperature data, is valuable and should be continued. However, he claims that the overall threat posed by global warming has been overplayed by scientists swayed by a political agenda and power-hungry civil servants. “There’s a huge amount of money that we spend on saving the planet,” he said. “If it turns out that the planet doesn’t need saving as much as we thought, well, there are other ways you could spend the money. “When you talk about fossil fuel companies being motivated, well, there’s nobody more motivated than the people working for the federal government,” he added. “You can’t rise in the American bureaucracy without some threat to address.” However, Holdren said that the evidence that human activity is causing global warming – a view supported by 97% of active climate researchers – is compelling. “It is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans are causing climate change,” he added. Happer said he began to question the emerging consensus view on climate change while working as director of research at the Department of Energy in 1991-93 as part of the George HW Bush administration. Climate scientists would “grudgingly” present their work to administrators, he claims, while those in other fields would share their results with enthusiasm. “I would ask questions but they were evasive and wouldn’t answer,” he said. “This experience really soured me on the community. I started reading up and I realised why they weren’t answering the questions: because they didn’t have good answers. It was really at that point that I began to get seriously worried about climate as a science.” Concerns about the Trump administration’s apparent disregard for mainstream scientific thinking on climate change has triggered a wave of activism, including plans for a science march in various cities. However, Happer said that the public, who may view scientists as part of a privileged elite, may be less sympathetic. “There’s a potential downside [to the march] of them being seen as a greedy bunch of spoiled people,” he said. “I don’t think they’re that way myself, but it could be easily twisted into that kind of narrative.” David Gelernter, a Yale computer scientist who has also questioned the reality of manmade climate change, is also reported to be in the running for the role of science adviser, but was not available for interview. • This article was amended on 17 February 2017.

But injury struck and Stapleton never made it. His coach told him that he had two options – waste time feeling sorry for himself, or start training for the next season. Stapleton, who was speaking at the Guardian’s Confessions of a Small Business seminar, went on to found the New Covent Garden soup company, which pioneered the idea of fresh, chilled ready-made soups, and Little Dish, which offers healthy ready meals for children. His favourite quote, he said, is from former American football player Lou Holtz: “Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and I’ll show you someone who has overcome adversity.” But Stapleton has his own spin: “If you don’t experience adversity, you’re not putting yourself out there enough.” The event was an opportunity for small business owners to share what they had learned from setbacks along the way. For Stapleton, a strong belief in your product was key to its success: food industry experts had told him that chilled soup was unworkable and might kill someone – soups had to be sterilised. Ignorance of the scale of the challenge can sometimes be bliss, he added: “You can be halfway up the mountain before you realise what the challenges are.” Stapleton’s keynote speech was followed by a panel discussion by the owners of three very different businesses: Joanna Montgomery, who founded Little Riot, which makes Pillow Talk wristbands; Nick Edwards, founder of software company Papaya Resources; and Arpana Gandhi, who founded Disarmco, a company that has developed a safe way of disposing of landmines and other unexploded ordnance (explosive weapons). Each had faced setbacks that could have ended their business. For Edwards, whose company makes software for the food industry, the setback came in the form of human tragedy. In 2012, on the verge of signing an important legal agreement, his key developer was killed in a hit-and-run accident. Edwards, who knew little about how the product worked, decided to start again and formed a partnership with a large food manufacturer to make sure the platform met the needs of users. He learned not to rely on a single developer – he now has four. Terrible though the tragedy was, it gave him focus: “It really did shape where I wanted to take the business and now we supply quite a number of the food manufacturers in the UK.” Gandhi’s journey to bring her Dragon Torch product to market has been a long, uphill struggle. Her business partner John Reid, who invented the product, died in 2014. “The whole process almost had to start again,” said Gandhi. “We had to find another innovator, who would believe [in it], to pick up the pieces and go along with the business.” But investors weren’t interested in taking a risk on a product that might, in their view, not work. The proposition wasn’t helped by the case of businessman Gary Bolton, who was jailed in 2013 for selling fake bomb detectors. Gandhi’s decision to put £150,000 of her own money into the business did nothing to give investors confidence, so she went to crowdfunding company CrowdCube to raise a further £150,000. She was encouraged by the messages of support she received. “There comes a point in business life where you just think everything is against you,” she said. “But then something comes along to give you a little bit more hope and that’s exactly what you hang on to, and you want to fight another day.” Joanna Montgomery’s experience with crowdfunding was less successful. After five years of research and development, she used Kickstarter to raise funding for Pillow Talk, a product that transmits the sound of the user’s heartbeat, in real time, to their partner. The company quickly reached its target, but Kickstarter experienced a glitch that resulted in the business being able to collect only 60% of the money it had raised. Montgomery said there were times when she felt like quitting, but was motivated to keep going by the response she had. “Every time I thought maybe this is not going to work, I’d get another email from a retailer saying, ‘Can we place a wholesale order?’, or just another ordinary person telling me their husband is in the military and how it would add value to their lives,” she said. Two audience members shared stories of facing sudden downturns. One, Aidan Bell, had set up a solar energy business with a friend that within three years had 300 staff and was turning over £8m a month. When business stopped coming in as a result of a change to government plans, they limited the number of people they made redundant to 100 because they were “emotionally tied” to staff. Since then, Bell has set up EnviroBuild, which is a “bit leaner” and makes greater use of outsourcing rather than relying on payroll staff. Another audience member lost a customer who provided 50% of their company’s business. “We were devastated,” she said. But it worked out: “It was good for us as we had to fight back and we grew the business back up.” That customer has now returned – but provides only 5% of the business: “We declared we would not have one company we were that dependent on again.” Panelists admitted that one of the hardest things to do was knowing when to listen to other people. Montgomery said that she had often been offered conflicting advice, but had concluded that “the kind of people I want around me are those who give me advice, but then let me make my own decisions”. Because Edwards’s product covers multiple areas such as safety and HR, he has recently brought in “some key people that look after those areas. If I don’t listen to them, it’s going to be really pointless”. For Gandhi, the technical nature of her business made taking advice an imperative: “The bomb disposal experts and I have a rule of thumb. I don’t pick up a screwdriver and they don’t pick up a spreadsheet. It works very well.” While many of the topics covered practical aspects of dealing with failure, all the speakers emphasised the psychological importance of self-belief and trusting your instincts. The last word goes to Stapleton: “You need to love what you’re doing. If you don’t love what you’re doing, you’re more than likely going to fail.” Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/08/energy-companies-call-on-mps-to-save-australias-renewables-agency-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-07T20:10:30Z","webTitle":"Energy companies call on MPs to save Australia's renewables agency funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/energy-companies-call-on-mps-to-save-australias-renewables-agency-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/08/energy-companies-call-on-mps-to-save-australias-renewables-agency-funding","fields":{"headline":"Energy companies call on MPs to save Australia's renewables agency funding","bodyText":"Some of Australia’s best-known energy companies including AGL, GE and Tesla, have joined calls to halt plans to cut $1.3bn from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The 24 companies signed an open letter to parliamentarians released by the Clean Energy Council. The Coalition has introduced its “omnibus” savings bill, which wraps up savings that both major parties claimed in their election costings. It includes a $1.3bn cut to Arena, which removes its future grant-making ability, essentially abolishing the agency. “The implications of substantial cuts to Arena would be profound,” the signatories said in the letter released on Thursday. Businesses have only recently regained confidence to invest in renewable energy, they said, following the “challenging period of political instability and policy change”. “Investment is flooding back into the sector as stability returns and the fundamentals of clean energy investment start to shine through,” they wrote. “Investment confidence would be again undermined if one of the first moves of the new parliament is to cut funding to Australia’s key clean energy agency. This would damage Australia’s reputation and unsettle investors, again. The supply chains and skills that have been established could be lost and would be very difficult and expensive to redevelop again in the future.” “Clean energy is one of Australia’s best opportunities for jobs, growth and innovation. Arena’s ability to deliver new grant programs is at risk with legislation before the Australian parliament that would substantially cut its future funding. While we respect the fiscal challenges facing the government and the nation, we believe that cutting Arena’s budget would be shortsighted.” The signatories include AGL, GE, Tesla, engineering company ABB, Vestas, Goldwind, Pacific Hydro, Suntrix, Conergy, First Solar and Infigen Energy. Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said the grant funding from Arena had helped bring down the cost of renewable energy and storage, and leveraged hundreds of millions of dollars in private investment. “Hundreds of projects have been funded to date, and hundreds more are needed if we are to transform Australia’s energy system at the lowest possible cost to consumers,” Thornton said. The Guardian revealed last week the threat of cuts to Arena has already caused at least two renewable energy projects to be suspended – one in New South Wales and one in Western Australia. Analysis from the Australian Conservation Foundation suggested the cuts threatened more than 5,100 jobs, with a majority of those in Queensland. The open letter follows another from 190 solar researchers, calling on all political parties to support Arena. “If Arena is debilitated then hundreds of people would lose their jobs within a year or two,” the researchers said. “In the longer term, Australia’s leadership in solar energy would vanish. This would be completely at odds with the government’s innovation agenda and its commitment at the Paris climate conference…” Although Labor accepted the cuts to Arena, and banked the savings in its election costings, it has indicated it might oppose the measure since it does not include an extra $300m for renewable energy projects that Labor also took to the election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-25T19:00:19Z","webTitle":"A Texas startup's big energy idea: storing electricity underground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy","fields":{"headline":"A Texas startup's big energy idea: storing electricity underground","bodyText":"In a field in Central Texas, Aaron Mandell and his crew are running pumping equipment to bring a former oil and gas well back to life. But they’re not trying to extract black gold. Instead, they are developing a way to turn abandoned oil and gas wells into vaults for storing electricity. The concept behind Mandell’s startup, Quidnet Energy, sounds simple: pumping water deep into the earth to fill up the cracks in-between rocks that previously held fossil fuels. When the pressurized water is released, it acts like a spring as it races through a turbine-generator above ground, powering it to produce electricity. Mandell, co-founder and chairman of Quidnet, is part of a growing number of entrepreneurs in an emerging market to use batteries or other technologies to bank electricity when prices and demand are low, and discharge it when they are high. The US market installed 221 megawatts of energy storage projects in 2015, up from the 65 megawatts added in 2014, according to GTM Research. The market research firm expects the annual installation to exceed 1 gigawatt in 2019. The energy storage market is growing fast primarily because of the increasing amount of solar and wind energy being produced across the country, from rooftop solar panels to acres of wind turbines. Storing solar and wind energy for later use circumvents a big disadvantage of these two types of low-carbon energy: they can’t always produce electricity whenever needed because demand fluctuates, reaching a peak in the early evening when people return home and turn on appliances or during hot summer months. Utilities in states with more renewable energy are starting to pay for energy storage services or build their own. Just last week, AES Energy Storage said it will build two giant lithium-ion battery systems for San Diego Gas and Electric in California, which is the biggest solar energy state in the country. “Our goal is to allow renewables like solar and wind to penetrate the power market at much larger percentages than we have today,” Mandell said. Quidnet recently lined up a new round of venture capital, bringing the total amount they have raised to just over $1m. The company previously snagged a seed funding of $500,000 from Clean Energy Venture Group. Quidnet’s other investors include Will and Jada Smith Foundation and the Sorenson Impact Foundation, both of which invested through Prime, a nonprofit advising foundations that want to put money into technology, which isn’t a familiar territory for philanthropic organizations. Quidnet’s investors are betting on what they believe will be a cheaper alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have dominated the energy storage projects in recent years, said Daniel Goldman, co-founder and managing director at Clean Energy Venture Group, the Quidnet investor. “We view Quidnet as solving one of the most important challenges – enabling renewable resources such as wind and solar to penetrate the market while accomplishing an important goal of maintaining grid stability,” Goldman said. Quidnet plans to build and operate energy storage projects for power plant owners, utilities and industrial companies. The company’s technology is similar to a widely used and cheaper energy storage setup that pumps water from a dam to an upstream reservoir when electricity prices are low. During peak times when electricity is more expensive, the water is drained back down to run through a turbine to generate power. Instead of an above-ground reservoir, Quidnet stores water underground. The company launched a pilot project this past year in Erath County, Texas, to demonstrate the concept. Mandell and his co-founder Howard Schmidt, an engineer with oil company Saudi Aramco, used an abandoned natural gas well, which runs 2,800 feet deep, into a reservoir that could hold 50k gallons of water. The project showed that after pumping water into the well for 12 hours, their technology could generate six hours of electricity. Quidnet’s idea is so unusual that it still needs to overcome some technical challenges to make it feasible for a well-run, large scale energy storage operation. “In theory, this idea can be helpful,” said Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its atmosphere and energy program. “The technology should work so long as the reservoir does not leak and so long as the outflow can be controlled and is fast enough.” Choosing well-sealed underground reservoirs to prevent the pressurized water from leaking is one of Quidnet’s biggest concerns. Mandell said the pilot project recorded far lower water losses than anticipated: 1% of the water per week instead of per day. “We were impressed with the team and ‘pumped hydro’ concept using geologic reservoirs,” said Goldman. Next, Quidnet plans to run another pilot project, this time at an old geothermal well in northern Nevada. The well is 14 inches in diameter, larger than a typical oil and gas well, making it possible to inject a higher volume of water – and generating more power faster – at any time. The reservoir can hold up to 85k barrels of water, and produce 10 hours of electricity following a 14-hour charge. The new pilot project will store electricity from a geothermal power plant in Nevada run by AltaRock Energy, where Mandell is also CEO. The power plant sells electricity to NV Energy, the largest utility in Nevada. Nevada is a good place to be for energy storage service companies. Nevada, along with other Western states like Oregon and Idaho, recently joined the California Independent System Operator (Caiso), which manages the wholesale electricity market in the state. As part of the deal, the member states will receive excess solar energy from California, which they can store and use to provide round-the-clock clean electricity, said Mandell. Ultimately, Quidnet hopes to build its own wells in locations with a high demand for energy storage. Each of its projects will operate up to 20 wells, with each well measuring between 1000-5000 feet deep and capable of storing 35 megawatt hours of energy. The company is also working on software to automating a storage project’s operation so that a project owner can run it remotely. An energy storage project could be measured in watts or watt-hours, depending on what information a project owner wants to convey. The term “watts” (a megawatt is a million watts) denotes how fast power can be charged or discharged at any time. A watt-hour refers to the amount of energy that can be stored or released in a given hour. The cost of building each well varies by depth, said Mandell, and Quidnet aims to build a project at $50 per kilowatt-hour of energy, a cost that will include the well, turbine generator, planning and securing permits. What’s not included is the cost of drilling exploratory wells to identify the proper underground geology for storing water. “Fortunately, the oil, gas and geothermal industries have already done this exploration work for us – there are hundreds of thousands of wells drilled all over the country that we’ll use to tell us exactly where to install storage,” he said."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/13/global-water-crisis-innovation-solution","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T09:51:35Z","webTitle":"Could these five innovations help solve the global water crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/13/global-water-crisis-innovation-solution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/13/global-water-crisis-innovation-solution","fields":{"headline":"Could these five innovations help solve the global water crisis?","bodyText":"The global water crisis has many causes, requiring many different solutions. As 1.2 billion people live in areas of water scarcity, these solutions must span policy, technology, and behaviour change to make a real difference. A number of technological innovations address the crisis in novel ways. We asked two water experts – Vincent Casey, senior water and sanitation adviser at WaterAid, and Hannah Safford, an energy and environmental policy analyst – to assess some of the most creative approaches. Drinkable Book In partnership with non-profit Water is Life, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed this education and filtration tool. Each page of the book provides basic water and sanitation advice, such as the importance of keeping contaminants like rubbish and faeces away from water, often unknown in developing countries. Perhaps more novel is that the advice is printed on “scientific coffee filter” paper that can be used to purify drinking water and reduce 99.9% of bacteria. Each book has enough filtration sheets to provide its reader with clean water for four years. It’s being distributed in Ghana, Kenya, Haiti, Ethiopia, India and Tanzania, and a Farsi version of the book is in development. Casey: Many different filter products will purify water and remove pathogens, but it needs to have a demand from users. It also needs to be affordable [in the local context] or come with some credit mechanism. Filters play a crucial role in making the water safe, but if you’re not blocking other routes of transmission (eg flies on food, handwashing after toilet use) you will still have problems. In other words, any filter has to be part of a combined solution. WaterSeer It looks like a well, but instead of withdrawing groundwater, the WaterSeer uses the surrounding environment to extract water from the atmosphere. It is planted six feet below the surface, where its lower chamber is surrounded by cool earth. Above ground, wind spins a turbine which spins fan blades inside the device. These blades send the air into an internal condensation chamber where, as the warm air cools, the vapour condenses on the sides of the chamber. Water then flows down to the lower chamber and can be extracted with a simple pump and hose. In ideal conditions, it can collect 37 litres of water a day. Developed by VICI labs in the US, the project is being tested by the National Peace Corps Association and will be piloted later this year. Casey: If we take sub-Saharan Africa as an example, groundwater tends to be available in most places we work – about 20m below the surface. So it’s a management or infrastructure problem that prevents people accessing water, not a lack of it. It’s not really about fixing the problem with technology; it’s about fixing the system. With this example, I would imagine there could be problem with vandalism, as the device seems quite fragile. However, that’s not to say that technology is not part of the solution – it has a role, but it’s makes up 20% of the whole picture, along with policy and management. Graphene filters Desalination, converting saltwater into freshwater, has historically been too expensive and energy-intensive to serve as a widespread solution for improving access. However, Lockheed Martin has developed and patented a Perforene graphene filter which it claims would reduce the energy cost of conventional reverse osmosis desalination by 20%, while withstanding higher pressure and temperatures. The perforated, hyper-permeable filter is one atom thick and is said to improve the flow of water compared to conventional methods by 500%. While the technology would be hugely beneficial to the oil and gas sector, which reportedly produces 18bn gallons of wastewater each year, the company is also researching other applications for the technology, including in food and energy generation. Safford: Desalination should only be used as a last resort. Emphasis should be placed on smart water management, reducing water losses, and increasing the uptake of water-efficient technologies practices. But in regions where there is truly not enough freshwater to meet demand, a cheaper and less energy-intensive desalination method is certainly a good thing. Fog catchers Vast mesh nets capture moisture from fog, which drips into collection trays after condensation. The largest of these projects is on the slopes of Mount Boutmezguida, a microclimate in Morocco where 6,300 litres of water can be harvested per day. The water is clean, free and instant, which is perhaps why Dar Si Hmad – the non-profit responsible for the project –was awarded the UN’s 2016 Momentum for Change award. First developed in South America, fog catching systems also exist in Chile, Peru, Ghana, Eritrea, South Africa and California. Safford: Fog catching could provide a sustainable supply of drinking water for small communities in water-scarce regions, but it is unlikely to generate enough water to significantly increase water supplies. The Mount Boutmezguida project only generates enough water to serve about 160 people per day – a project of a similar size in a developed country would serve a smaller number of people [due to higher consumption habits]. Solar crop In hot and dry climates, many farmers pump groundwater to irrigate crops, and there has been a growth in the use of solar-powered pumps. A problem arises when farmers view solar energy as free, as it can cause over-irrigation. A part-technological, part policy and management solution by CGIAR’s research programme on water, land and ecosystems, and in partnership with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), incentivises farmers using solar pumps to sell excess power back to the grid. The guaranteed buy-back scheme produces a “triple win”; farmers gain income, the state gains electricity reserves, and the water source is conserved by curbing usage – all while reducing carbon emissions. The scheme is being piloted in Gujarat, and IWMI estimates that solarising India’s 20m irrigation wells could reduce carbon emissions by 4-5% per year. Casey: A good initiative addressing a serious problem through changes to policy and management, not just focusing on a technical solution. In addition, selling electricity back to the grid could generate revenue to conduct maintenance on these pumps – a good sign for the sustainability of the arrangement. What have we missed?

Sayed Mirwais Rohani had been in Australia for around two years, after more than four years on Manus Island. The 32-year-old Hazara man is believed to have taken his own life, and is the 13th death of a person sent to Manus Island or Nauru by Australia under its offshore immigration system. Rohani’s father is a refugee living in the UK with his wife, and he travelled to Manus Island in 2016 seeking his son’s release to join him in the UK. The spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, said that request was denied because Rohani was not a minor. • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78 Arthur Sinodinos, who is doing his farewell tour across the parliament (he’s off to Washington), was asked by Patricia Karvelas what message his colleagues should take from his valedictory speech yesterday: Look, ultimately it’s up to people what messages they take out of it. I think that is a message. I think one of the other messages is that ultimately this is a team game. And you have to accept in politics you can’t always do what you want, even as a backbencher. You’re part of a team and government only works if it’s a team. There will also be a lot of media bigwigs in Canberra tomorrow – the media freedom inquiry will hold a public hearing. The medevac senate report is due to be handed down tomorrow. Amanda Stoker led the committee, which is government heavy, so I think we can assume it is going to recommend the legislation be repealed. Labor and the Greens are expected to enter in dissenting reports. Then, when the senate returns in November, it will all be up to Jacqui Lambie. In the meantime, Helen Davidson had this story: The Australian Border Force transferred a seriously mentally ill man to Perth from Melbourne, where a youth mental health facility was preparing to treat him – then took almost a month to bring him back. On Tuesday, after being flown 2,700km across the country, admitted to hospital emergency or psychiatric departments six times, held in various forms of detention, then flying another 2,700km, the young man was finally taken to the facility that had originally offered to treat him. The shock early-morning transfer from the Melbourne detention centre, Mita, to Perth, was on a commercial Qantas flight – just one day after the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, proclaimed that the company would not be silent on social issues. The young asylum seeker was removed from the Melbourne detention centre in the early hours of 19 September, allegedly without warning and without consulting the external health professionals who were arranging to have him readmitted to the Melbourne facility. No reason for the transfer was given, as far as Guardian Australia is aware. This is not a sight you will see too often – an LNP senator sitting with the crossbench, against the government. Susan McDonald chaired the committee that recommended the additional maintenance requirements be removed from charity flight operators – which is what Rex Patrick is calling for. Labor voted with the government. And from this, I think you can infer from this answer on the voice to parliament, Ken Wyatt has set out that the government will be pushing to legislate, before heading to the referendum Patricia Karvelas: You do know you’ll break a lot of hearts by not putting the voice to the people? Ken Wyatt: We also have to be pragmatic and that’s a reality. PK: But do you acknowledge you’re going to break a lot of people’s hearts? KW: Some people have told me it will break their hearts. We have to think about whether we want to be recognised in the Constitution. PK: What’s the point of recognition without power, Senator? KW: Recognition was in section 127 in the Constitution but in the sense of not allowing us to be counted. 127 was struck out. The 1967 referendum created a number of myths around what it really meant to people. The reality was, was the striking out of that and then the amendment, the 51-26. This requires further work on what are the sets of words that recognise this within the Constitution. 51-26 has been predominantly used for Indigenous Australians to support Commonwealth legislation on very critical issues such as the Mabo decision, land rights, etc ... What I don’t want to see is that removed totally which then leaves a challenge in terms of the legitimacy of those. PK: Would you like to see it changed? KW: I’m going to wait to see what comes out. I’ve been meeting with people and there is a degree of willingness to have recognition. I think that once we work through whatever the voice is, and that may give us another option. What I suspect will happen is that we may legislate first and then when that’s successful, then we can go back for the next bite of the Constitution. On the legislated voice issue, Ken Wyatt says he is pushing ahead: Well, we’ve got a timetable I’m proposing to take to the PM. Once that’s been agreed to in the process that he and I will undertake, and my cabinet colleagues and certainly members of parliament, then we will announce that and we will clearly lay out the process and the structures that are within that. Patricia Karvelas: What about if people don’t want a legislated voice? KW: I suspect that if we went with a nebulous notion of a voice to the greater Australian public, it would not have the support. Constitutional recognition, with the exception of John Howard’s referendum, tends not to come back as a question to be put at a later stage. Local government is slightly different because people have fought to try and get local government recognised in the constitution and we’ve had parliamentary committees deal with that. But I don’t want to see us lose an opportunity. And that’s what we’ve got to do, do it very steadily. I don’t want this to be rushed that we get it wrong and that we lose it. When I look at the referendums that have been successful, Labor was successful with one on social services. That’s because Bob Menzies is the leader and did not oppose what Labor had done to the Australian public. In a sense there was this bipartisan support. But you need both sides to the political divide. PK: What process have you gone through now to get Labor on board? It is meant to be bipartisan. KW: I’m having dinner with my colleagues on an evening that we have chosen next week – the Indigenous members of the parliament who are predominantly Labor. PK: In terms of the timeline, I know you’re taking this to the PM, can you give me an indication of the kind of timeframe that you think is workable. KW: It is before the next election because we don’t a referendum tied in with an election. There is an unintended consequence of that we don’t need. It’s important we have this pristine space in which the question can be put, the debate’s had andAustralians make the decision. PK: You think you can have a referendum on recognition before the next election? KW: I’m optimistic. Patricia Karvelas: Many Indigenous people are opposed to this idea of legislating the voice. Have you convinced them? Ken Wyatt: No. I haven’t. But we will start a process. I’ve been talking to a lot of people as I’ve moved across the nation. Issues like sovereignty come up. Communities say, “Who will listen to our voice? We want local issues and access to health, better education.” I think Linda Burney discovered that when she travelled from Port Hedland to Uluru because I saw her and she made the very pertinent point – they were concerned about local matters that needed resolving. PK: In terms of a proposal for changing the Constitution, you’ve made it quite clear to the disappointment of many that you don’t want the voice to be in the Constitution. So what will constitutional change look like under the Morrison Government? KW: We will work through those over the next 12 months. PK: Can you give me some parameters? KW: There will be recognition. PK: What will that look like? KW: That will need to be worked through with our people. And has to be acceptable within a legal framework. What I don’t want is a section 44 issue being created. We have to be pragmatic and have many non-Indigenous Australians who are supportive but are saying, “I’m concerned until you tell us what the sets of words are because I’m not going to commit to something that creates a division between a nation that is becoming more unified.” The number of non-indigenous people who have said, “We will stand with Indigenous Australians. We want to see them recognised but get the words right.” On the ABC, Patricia Karvelas has an interview with Ken Wyatt about where the plan for Indigenous reconciliation is at. We will announce in the very near future a working group that will define the voice but will take in to consideration local, regional, state and national approaches. One of the things I’ve made very clear to state and territory ministers is they already have voices ... I don’t want to take them out of the equation. There will be a substantial piece of work that will be undertaken and as soon as I finalise it, crossing a couple of Ts and dotting some Is then we’ll start the process. PK: My understanding is you’re about to take that proposal to the PM. Can you give me an indication of what is in that proposal? KW: I can’t do that until I’ve had a discussion with my leader. PK: Am I right you are about to take a proposal to the PM for a way forward on legislation to actually establish a voice in this term of parliament? KW: What I’ll be doing is taking forward a series of propositions to do with constitutional recognition, the voice and truth telling. Each of those are separate pieces of work because they are critical in their own right. But what I also want to do is talk about the way in which government will take elements of that forward as we co-design. I’m seriously committed to working through with our people to a solution that they’re comfortable with as well, not just as we’ve always done in the past, come forward with the voices of a few. And then made a decision. Rex Patrick has been fighting to have the aviation body, Casa, reduce the number of maintenance requirements on charity aircrafts, and adopt the NZ model. Over in the Senate, new LNP senator Susan McDonald is crossing the floor to support a motion from Rex Patrick This is either “waiting for a mate”, or “sorry, it’s saved”, depending on your generation. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers Scott Morrison, playing the role of today’s mood (as captured by Mike Bowers) And we are done. The folders are very stacked though. Hopefully this means we are coming to the end. Nope. Scott Morrison just raised a finger and said “one more” to Tony Smith. It’s on the Prime Minister’s Science Prize. So at least it’s a worthy dixer. We’re at the swap sides of the chamber stage of the latest farce Luke Howarth and Andrew Laming have both made beelines for the frontbench this time round. Christian Porter seems very confused about whether or not there is a motion before the House. Tony Smith seems very confused about why Christian Porter is confused. Tony Burke is now trying to explain to Christian Porter about how the motion process works. Tony Smith is now agreeing with Tony Burke while still trying to work out why Christian Porter is confused. And now we all have to sit here for another four minutes because that whole explanation of standing orders took so long, Smith has to extend the bells. “Bring back Christopher,” Anthony Albanese yells. Christian Porter has been confused into silence, so I guess there has been some silver lining. Labor is attempting to suspend standing orders, to debate the economy. It will fail. Obviously. Joel Fitzgibbon is taking the silences in between the divisions to troll Michael McCormack about his press conference being overshadowed by the prime minister’s radio interview, where he made the same announcement, but got in first. National MPs are still sending ‘can’t believe that happened’ messages. Good times all round. Stay with me folks. My computer program is struggling. I know the feeling. After a Senate estimates session dominated by two topics – the economy and raising Newstart – Labor’s Kristina Keneally has asked Mathias Cormann three ways why the prime minister has repeatedly refused to deny that he sought to have Brian Houston invited to the White House. Cormann is keeping the answers simple - he has nothing further to add to what Scott Morrison has said. Labor MPs are calling out “what are you hiding?” Seems they’ll need Senate Estimates next week, or maybe to bring out medieval instruments of torture like thumbscrews, to get to the bottom of this. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister: Yesterday in the Parliament the Prime Minister shut down a proposed debate on the economy and organised an additional question to himself so that only he could talk about the economy. Is that because the Prime Minister only wants to listen to himself? Will the Prime Minister agree to a debate on the economy today or doesn’t he have the confidence in his own economic management? Morrison: When the Labor Party can confirm what their actual policies are, maybe that’s when they want to start asking those questions. That’s the entire answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull all facilitated parliamentary debate at this time in the parliament on important economic issues facing the nation. Does the prime minister have the confidence in his economic position to be able to swallow his pride, follow their example and agree to a debate on the state of the economy today? Morrison: Every time, almost without exempt exemption, I come to this despatch Box, I’m talking about our economic policies. And the reason I do that – the reason I did that at the last election, Mr Speaker, the reason I do that is because I know that the strong economy is absolutely central to everything. It’s ensuring that you have the right economic policies that provide the bedrock to create the budget that can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. That’s exactly what our government has been doing. In season and out, despite what the global challenges are, we have continued to be able to build the strength and capability of our budget position, but also of the Australian economy which has seen now almost 1.5 million Australians get a job. Now, Mr Speaker, that is the greatest argument when it comes to the economic policies of this government and that’s almost 1.5 million Australians who have got a job. That’s - that’s the great evidence, Mr Speaker, of 1.5 million almost lives of Australians that have been transformed because as a result of the policies of this government that has set the framework and economy for people to go and invest and take people on, Australians’ lives have been changed because the Liberal Party and Nationals believe that strong economic management, that disciplined and stable and certain financial policies are what actually at the end of the day guarantee our ability to reach record levels of hospital funding, record levels of education funding, and in the midst of what is a very severe drought, Mr Speaker, that we could again today confirm that those who would be coming off the farm household allowance will be given a $13,000 payment as a supplementary payment and just over $7,000 - $7,500, Mr Speaker, for individuals to continue to support them. And we’re able to do this within the constraints of the budget which has been brought back to surplus. As I remarked in this place some time ago, the Leader of the Opposition, he wants to have debates. I’m getting on with things. But how can the Leader of the Opposition have a debate when he can’t tell us what his tax policy is, what his climate change policy is or any other critical issues that he fails to answer questions on a daily basis. He hasn’t got a policy agenda, Mr Speaker. The reason we have to talk about their record in government and their policy agenda from the last election is they haven’t had any policies since that time. So it is absolutely fair for the Australian people, Mr Speaker, to hold them to their record of the policies they took to the last election and they were condemned for those policies by the Australian people at that time. We will continue, Mr Speaker, to deliver the policies that were confirmed at the last election - policies that over the last six years have created more almost 1.5 million jobs for Australians. To his credit, Dave Sharma manages to look a little embarrassed asking the next dixer, especially when he gets to the ‘alternative views’ part. “It’s terrible when bad questions happen to good members,” Ed Husic says. He is very much making hay from his backbench position. We are just about 3/4 through this and we have had 11 mentions of “panic” and eight uses of “crises” from government ministers in response to Labor questions. Deidre bloody Chambers! It’s almost like they ... have talking notes ... on ... a ... phrase they would like to catch on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia’s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition seems quite insistent on this point. But he obviously wasn’t insistent this morning because the matter of public importance which has been tabled today by the federal member for Barton does not mention the word “economy” at all, Mr Speaker. The word “economy”... is not even in it. So, Mr Speaker, if he can’t get his own side to agree about something, and that’s not uncommon at the moment, Mr Speaker, it’s not uncommon... I know that the Labor Party’s penchant is for panic and crisis, Mr Speaker, but honestly - he’s got to try to resolve the panic and crisis that is going on within his own party on so many issues. Whether it’s on - their response to climate, which they say is an emergency, but we’re not going to know their policy about it until the next election. And in between times, we’re going of the constant infighting between the member for Hunter and the member for South Australia... What is it again? Hindmarsh. The member for Hindmarsh, or member for Sydney or any other members. Or whether the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is going to tear itself apart. Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I’ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia’s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition seems quite insistent on this point. But he obviously wasn’t insistent this morning because the matter of public importance which has been tabled today by the federal member for Barton does not mention the word “economy” at all, Mr Speaker.

The member for Hindmarsh, or member for Sydney or any other members. Or whether the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is going to tear itself apart. Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I’ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Angus Taylor actually just uttered the words “we are unified on energy and climate policy on this side of the House,” with a straight face, and honestly, I now understand how he got that Rhodes scholarship. It’s Peter Dutton HOW SAFE ARE YOU time! How safe are we today, Peter Dutton? Well, Australia, I’m really glad you asked. You are as safe as we can make you. BUT JUST IMAGINE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. THE CHAOS. THE PANIC. THE KRAKENS! WHY, THE TRIFFIDS WOULD RISE UP. Thankfully Australia, you have Peter Dutton. So it’s all cool beans. Dutton finishes. Ed Husic: “Yeah, but you choose Greg [Hunt] as your deputy leader. It’s TRUE.” Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister. Given wage growth is the lowest it’s ever been, household debt is at record highs and consumer confidence is at a four-year low, why does the prime minister dismiss the role that this parliament has to play in debating the economic policy direction of the nation? Or doesn’t he have the confidence in his own position to be able to do so? Morrison: It’s all about you, isn’t it?! Through you, Mr Speaker! It’s about the Australian people, Mr Speaker. We debate these matters in the parliament everyday as the measures that we ... Apparently, Mr Speaker, when we bring legislation into this parliament that deals with economic measures, they’re apparently not debated in this place. The Leader of the Opposition has been here long enough to know that this debating chamber deals with copious pieces of legislation, Mr Speaker, and there is ample time. Now, before the election - next election, Mr Speaker, there will be the opportunity for the types of things that the Leader of the Opposition is speaking about and I have no doubt that will be the case as it is on every other occasion. But, Mr Speaker, it seems the debate he needs to have is within his own party because within his own party, they have got the climate fight club going on over there with umpteen different positions on climate change and, Mr Speaker, he’s got his own problems when it comes to the distractions of the New South Wales branch where I see compensation payments are measured in how many Aldi bags they’re handing out. [This bit was very, very loud.] Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance. Morrison: I’m in this place every single day talking about the economy. When we came to government, the real wage growth through the year was 0.5% and now today it’s 0.7%. I note the comments of the most recent RBA minutes and it says this, “Despite the level of high household debt in Australia, relative to other countries, the risks from household debt appear to have been mostly contained. Members noted that households continue to have large repayments on their housing debt and aggregate mortgage repayments equal to 2.5 years of repayment.” Mr Speaker, whether it comes to what we’re doing on jobs, whether it comes to what we’re doing in restoring the budget to surplus to ensure we’re there not only to meet the needs of today but we’re thinking ahead to meet the needs of tomorrow because we know how to keep our heads, to keep calm, Mr Speaker, and to ensure we continue to lay out the policies which we know are having the impact that they need to have and particularly in relation to employment. Employment in this country is the beginning of everything. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and the longest three minutes of all our lifes begins anew. Empires have risen and fallen in this time. It’s amazing how he can make every minute feel like an hour. It’s Bob Katter time. He wants to know about a drought/dam plan. Are you aware that the PM after the north’s flooding cattle deaths came, listened and delivered two dams and $200m. At the drought summit in contrast, did you not say that the free market is not necessarily benevolent, we must learn to accept climate change, we cannot carry you forever. Ideology – where is the survival plan? Isn’t this the policy of the corporate elites when you buy up owner-operator Australia and the city suits enriched by selling to foreigners. Have you stopped a single sale? Minister, who is the master that you serve? He directs the question to David Littleproud, who tells him that was a question for the treasurer, but that the government is working to do what it can, but needs the states to come on board. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the Prime Minister confirm that since 2002 only two Australian Treasurers have presided over an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average? Will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate in this Parliament on Australia’s economy today? And will he admit the only two Treasurers who have had an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average are the current Treasurer and himself? Morrison: I’m interested in the jobs of Australians. Hear, hear. That’s what I’m interested in. The Leader of the Opposition is clearly only interested in his own job because all he wants to do is have a talk-fest in this place. I’m interested in the jobs of Australians. And taking action to ensure Australians are in work. Mr Speaker, more and more Australians in work and more Australians are in work today as a share of the Australian population than at any other time in Australia’s history. So, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition may be thinking that this place, Mr Speaker, and the chatter that goes on here is terribly important to him and his position. I’m going to remain focused on those Australians, Mr Speaker, who simply want us to get on the job, on with the job, of ensuring we’re providing the stable and the calm and the responsible financial management which has brought the budget back to the surplus. Albanese stands up for a point of order, and Morrison goes to sit down, but not before saying what sounds like ‘another spurious point of order’ Albanese: There were two parts to the question. One part went to whether the current Treasurer and the current Prime Minister are the only two Australian Treasurers who... Yeah... He hasn’t mentioned that. The second is if he’s confident let’s have a debate about it. Tony Smith: No, I was just going to say to the Leader of the Opposition - whilst there’s additional tolerance extended to him because of his position and to the Prime Minister, points of order are not going to be used to ask another question or to make a political statement. There were two parts to the question. The Prime Minister can address one or the other or both. That’s the way it works. The Prime Minister has the call. Morrison: The Leader of the Opposition may want to come into this place and throw a tantrum at Question Time. Over whether or not someone’s going to agree to what he wants to do. He’s entitled... Mr Speaker, the tantrums of the Leader of the Opposition in this place only re-enforce their addiction to panic and crisis on the Labor Party. They love panic. They love crisis. And even when, Mr Speaker - even when circumstances don’t bear their argument out, they seek to create them, Mr Speaker, because they will look to any excuse to put their hands in the pockets of the Australian people and to rapidly increase spending to a reckless level. I referred earlier, Mr Speaker, to the catalogue of Labor Party failures in government when it came to policy. And the reason they engaged in those failures is they could never break their cycle of panic and crisis. They put in ill-considered measures, they didn’t think them through, they just smashed them through and in the Australian community and Australians have been paying for them ever since. At the last election I said, “You vote Labor once, you pay for it for the next decade”, and it seems exactly the same thing is true under this Leader of the Opposition. He can throw as many tantrums that he likes, we’ll just get on with the job of good government. There are quite a few high school students in the gallery today, who are looking very bemused at how they arrived at this place. Samesies. It’s another lickspittle to the prime minister on the economy. But rest assured - Michael McCormack will get his moment to pretend he still has ownership over drought policy as the Nationals leader. He’s just got to wait his turn. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Given that since May the Reserve Bank, the OECD, and the International Monetary Fund have all downgraded Australia’s growth forecast for this year, will the prime minister agree to have a debate in this chamber today on the economy? Morrison: I note – I understand from my colleagues that – they have listed for the MPI today [it] isn’t about the economy. So I’m a bit puzzled why they want one but they’re not prepared to table one, Mr Speaker. I tell you what – what our government is going to do, it’s not about debating the economy, it’s actually about implementing the policies that make our economy stronger and that’s what our government is doing. That’s what we’re doing, Mr Speaker. And we will continue to implement those sound and carefully-managed disciplined and stable and certain policies that as I have said today, Mr Speaker, has resulted in three years of consecutive increased in employment every single month, the longest run of jobs growth on a monthly basis this country has ever seen. So what we will do is not talk about it, we’ll get on to do it. I mean, government does job is a weird flex, but cool. You do you, Morrison government. We are now hearing the same answer again, but as a dixer. Dante obviously missed a circle. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. Yesterday the prime minister refused to debate the economy in this House. Will he debate today whether the IMF was wrong to downgrade Australia’s economic growth forecast? Morrison: As I confirmed yesterday, the IMF ... midyear budget update and of course at budget time. So that is the normal process in terms of budget forecast and other forecasts that are presented here or elsewhere. And so that is a matter of public record, Mr Speaker. We have made no commentary regarding the accuracy of others’ forecasts because the government provides forecasts of its own as part of the midyear budget process. We’ll be doing that when it comes to the end of the year in the normal course of events, but given I have been asked about forecasts and economic data, Mr Speaker, I’m very pleased to report to the House today that employment has increased by 14,000 jobs in the month of September. And that was in line with the expectations – around 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, and I can say that we are rapidly approaching a 1.5m jobs since this government was first elected and I can also inform the House that this monthly increase in jobs in this last month, jobs have increased every month for the last three years under this government and that is the longest run, I’m advised, of consecutive monthly jobs growth ever, Mr Speaker. This government has reduced the level of unemployment from 5.7 to 5.2% and also decreased the level of youth unemployment by also a full percentage point, Mr Speaker, over that period of time. This government is doing the work through patient, through methodical, through stable, through disciplined economic policies whether it’s ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn, or investing $100 billion in the infrastructure that the Australian economy needs to grow, investing and ensuring that we’re putting the right skills programs in place to enable people in this country to get the skills they need for the jobs that are there, Mr Speaker, and supporting business in the same way. Reducing the costs for business whether it’s in the industrial relations area, and I commend the minister for the work he’s doing, looking through all the things that are preventing people from getting jobs and costing unnecessarily the process of getting jobs and the work that the assistant minister is doing in stripping away regulations that is cost investment in this country. We’re expanding our trade horizons, lifting the percentage of trade agreements that cover our trade from 26% to 70 %. Our economic plan, the calm, measured, stable certain plan just gets on with the job of delivering for Australians and the increase of almost 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, 26,200 full-time jobs, bears that out. Given the Indigenous recognition push, this will be interesting. Scott Morrison has walked into the chamber with David Littleproud. See? EVERYTHING IS FINE Who’s that MP? It’s Ken O’Dowd. I’ll be heading to the chamber for question time – hit me up with your predictions (but I would say drought and the economy would be on the money). This is an interesting story from AAP: The Canberra bubble is truly full, with countries looking to set up shop in the capital being turned away because of a lack of available land. The National Capital Authority, which manages federal land in Canberra, told a parliamentary briefing they couldn’t offer much to those seeking land for diplomatic missions. “We’ve had a number of countries where we’ve basically said, ‘No, we can’t offer you anything’,” chief planner Andrew Smith said. He also told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their vacant land was ongoing. Smith said new embassies could be built for a number of reasons, including the beginning of a new diplomatic relationship with Australia or countries already stationed in Canberra looking to move out of rented premises. But some countries were also requesting larger premises for missions. “We are actually at a situation where we really can’t effectively offer anything much,” Smith said. He said there were a couple of vacant sites but the authority couldn’t offer them due to “reasons associated with terrain or soil conditions”. When contacted by AAP, the authority said it was up to the individual missions to confirm whether they had been turned back. The authority manages vacant sites but countries then have to look after it once they pick up the lease. It also has a “use it or lose it” policy where countries may have leased land taken away from them if they show no signs of developing it. Smith told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their own missions were continuing. Last year, the committee was told that Kuwait, Iran, Brunei, Russia and Bangladesh had stalled or inactive development on their land. At the time, Iran attributed delays to the unexpected death of their embassy’s new architect. It also said it was holding discussions with the ACT government on the shortage of diplomatic land. Just for a bit more context on that spat Sky’s Thomas O’Brien has been reporting on – the Nationals have been annoyed about how the drought policy has been handled for quite some time. There was agitation within the party when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister, with members pushing Michael McCormack to do more. Then, when Scott Morrison took over the leadership, he also took over on the drought, which furthered angered a group of National MPs, who thought the Liberals should not be leading on a policy area which traditionally, has been theirs. So there has been angst, but a truce was called, given the drought was, from a PR point at least, a headline issue for the government. Then the announcement happened – and those tensions boiled over again. For the record, none of the National MPs are willing to go on the record to say this. But yes, they are *annoyed* Labor and the Greens are teaming up against an expansion of the fast-track visa process which among others would cover asylum seekers who arrived by plane. Contrary to some reports this morning, it is not a motion to scrap the controversial process altogether – although the Greens’ position is that it should be scrapped. What is the fast-track process? It’s complicated and has changed over the years but essentially: The fast-track assessment and removal process was introduced in 2014, and later expanded. It applies to the group of people who sought asylum in Australia by boat from August 2012 to January 2014 (and any of their children) commonly referred to as the “legacy caseload” and numbered more than 30,000. Under the process, asylum seekers can only apply for three-year temporary protection visas (TPV) or five-year Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (Shev), and are denied access to a full administrative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A refusal will automatically receive a limited review by the Immigration Assessment Authority (which was established for this purpose and sits within the AAT), but the IAA won’t hear new information. Some fast-track applicants are excluded from this. The process is controversial, with some legal and refugee experts criticising it as being more focused on speed than fairness. The Greens and Labor motion seeks to scrap an expansion of the process to cover people from the legacy cohort reapplying after their TPV or Shev expires, as well as anyone who arrived by air and who applies for temporary protection. It applies to any application made after 1 April this year. Immigration minister David Coleman told the Australian this would result in application assessment times blowing out from an average of 23 days to 504 days and would put more strain on the AAT. Labor disputes the figures, claiming that as of February last year the average time (from lodgement to a primary decision) was 415 days for TPVs and 316 for Shevs. “Labor does not support the government’s unfair fast track process because it is neither fast nor fair – if it was the third term Liberal government would have been able to process these applications by now,” said a spokesman for shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally. Greens senator Nick McKim said the fast track process was neither fast nor fair. “It should be scrapped altogether, not expanded,” he said. “It was set up with the clear aim of reducing people’s chances of claiming asylum and denying them avenues of appeal. This government continues to demonise people who have fled persecution.” A group of ex-judges, anti-corruption commissioners, and experts have laid out a blueprint for improving political and democratic integrity in the wake of this year’s election. The Centre for Public Integrity used a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to argue there was “ample evidence” of the need for integrity reform, pointing to the $70m campaign spend by Clive Palmer and the post-political appointments of Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop. The centre, chaired by former NSW judge Anthony Whealy QC, wants parties and candidates to report all single donations of $1,000 or above or aggregated contributions of $3,000 over three years. The current threshold is $14,000. Donations should be disclosed to the public in real-time and include income from “party fundraisers, corporate sponsorship of business forums, and membership fees over $600 per year”. Electoral expenditure should be capped, and advertising limited by the finance or attorney-general’s department, which would purchase advertising space and distribute it to parties, candidates, and third parties. The centre also wants to see stronger post-separation employment bans apply to former ministers and parliamentary secretaries, preventing them from lobbying-related activities for five years in any area linked to their former portfolio. The ban would be enforced by an independent parliamentary integrity commissioner. “The Commonwealth has the weakest integrity laws in the country. Reform is crucial in the wake of the 2019 federal election,” Whealy said. The Centre for Public Integrity board includes ex-judges Tony Fitzgerald QC, David Ipp QC, Stephen Charles QC and Whealy, professors George Williams and Joo Cheong Tham, and barrister Geoffrey Watson SC. Mike Bowers has been very busy this morning. This would be the moment the Nationals gathered to announce the farm household allowance changes, but were overshadowed by the prime minister who was on not-Alan Jones radio doing exactly the same thing. Some colour in parliament, thanks to a Mongolian dance troupe. A very fed up Jacqui Lambie And that Senate light Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp have put together exactly what happened when Labor voted against the Greens motion to stop the government from scrapping the education infrastructure fund, in favour of redirecting it to emergency disaster responses: Labor has done a deal with the Morrison government to pass legislation redirecting education infrastructure money to disaster relief despite significant objections from the education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek. The opposition made the decision to sign on to the emergency response fund in a special shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday night, which also considered Labor’s stance on the free trade deal with Indonesia. But Guardian Australia understands Plibersek objected, and concerns persist within the caucus that the decision will blunt Labor’s ability to pursue the Coalition over cuts to education funding. Labor MPs, including the former research minister Kim Carr, have expressed concern that the redirection will deliver a significant blow to investment in research infrastructure. I have been flipping through some annual reports this morning. The Department of Employment provides us an update on the progress of its struggling $250m PaTH internships program. You might remember it’s the scheme where the government pays businesses like Hungry Jacks and Woolworths $1000 to host young welfare recipients. The interns get an incentive payment, which unions say equates to about $4 a day. The program was supposed to offer 30,000 internships a year – instead there have only been 6,464 since April 2017. The report does say that 65% of those internships led to a job. “Those who have completed Youth Jobs PaTH have achieved strong outcomes, but take-up continues to be a challenge,” the report says. The government poured another $10m into the scheme in August. Nick Martin (the doctor from the post a few down) approves this message Here’s the dairy industry inquiry motion Pauline Hanson put up and won (with the support of most of the Senate, excluding the government). That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the third sitting day in March 2020: the performance of Australia’s dairy industry and the profitability of Australian dairy farmers since deregulation in 2000, with particular reference to – (a) the ability of Dairy Australia to act independently and support the best interests of both farmers and processors; (b) the accuracy of statistical data collected by Dairy Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics; (c) the funding of Dairy Australia and the extent of its consultation and engagement on the expenditure of levies revenue; (d) the merits of tasking the ACCC to investigate how it can regulate the price of milk per litre paid by processors to dairy farmers to ensure a viable dairy industry; (e) alternative approaches to supporting a viable dairy sector; (f) the introduction of a mandatory industry code of practice; and (g) any related matters. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has also unleashed on Labor for its decision not to back a motion to save the education fund (Jacqui Lambie was also very, very angry at the move). Labor and the Government have teamed up to stab education in the back by abolishing billions in education funding. I don’t expect any better of the regressive Liberals who have cut education funding at every turn, but Labor used to be the party of education. Now they are just selling out communities and young people to remain politically relevant. Labor are so eager to please the Liberals they voted to abolish the infrastructure fund they themselves established. The reality is unis, Tafes and research have all suffered under this Liberal-National government. Education in Australia is being dangerously underfunded. The official Labor press conference on the free trade agreement decision is out. From Madeleine King’s office: We will back these agreements, although we are concerned about how this Government will implement them. We have consulted widely on these issues with stakeholders in the union movement, industry, academia and the public service. I have written to Trade Minister Simon Birmingham seeking firm commitments to ensure that the implementation of the agreements safeguard Australian jobs and maximise market access for Australian businesses. We are seeking: A guarantee that these agreements protect Australian jobs. An assurance that working holiday makers are not exploited and are appropriately qualified for the work they undertake. The termination of the existing bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia. The termination or updating of out-dated bilateral investment treaties and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses. A review of recent ISDS mechanisms in trade agreements. An inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) into Australia’s treaty-making process. An assurance that there is no inference from the agreements that would require the privatisation of government services, nor restrict any future decision to bring acquire public assets. Labor’s call for the Government to pursue the termination of the existing Bilateral Investment Treaty between Australia and Indonesia was recently backed by JSCOT’s recent review of these trade agreements. This old treaty contains ISDS clauses with poor safeguards. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements, but the report noted that the provisions in these new agreements include strong safeguards. Labor MPs on the JSCOT committee were instrumental in ensuring that these recommendations were included in the final report. Back in the Senate, One Nation put forward a motion to set up an inquiry into the “performance of Australia’s dairy industry and the profitability of farmers since deregulation in 2000”. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench all supported the inquiry. The government opposed it. Ayes - 33 Noes - 28 It is not often you see that section of the chamber supporting something One Nation puts up, but there you go. Just on Peter Dutton’s latest intervention on medevac, I have been reminded of this story from earlier in the year: A doctor on Nauru who blew the whistle on the deliberate medical neglect of refugees and asylum seekers on the island has been awarded a global award for free speech. Dr Nick Martin, the former senior medical officer for International Health and Medical Services on Nauru, spoke out publicly against what he described as Australia’s “inflexible, unswerving, and shameless” offshore immigration regime, that deliberately harmed asylum seekers and ignored doctors’ recommendations to treat dangerously ill people. In London on Wednesday night, he was awarded the 2019 Blueprint for Free Speech prize, an award previously won by Chelsea Manning, who revealed US military abuses and suspected war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA intelligence officer who revealed information about torture techniques including waterboarding. Martin is a veteran military doctor. The drug testing bill is on its way to the Senate. Labor is supporting the government’s call to abolish the $4bn education investment fund (the Coalition has wanted it gone since 2014 and, when it couldn’t get rid of it, just stopped spending the money from it, meaning it has sat there untouched), mostly because it doesn’t want to be seen as standing in front of emergency response fund (which is where the government wants to put this money). Jacqui Lambie has been calling for more Tafe funding for Tasmania since returning to the Senate. That’s why she is so angry. The money that is there, for that purpose, is now being officially taken away. Oh FFS. From AAP: Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has claimed Australian war veterans want refugee medical evacuation laws scrapped. Mr Dutton is locked in negotiations with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, herself an army veteran, as he seeks to repeal the so-called medevac laws. “I believe very strongly that most Australians and certainly the vast majority of veterans would want us to abolish this law,” he told 2GB Radio on Thursday. There does not seem to be any evidence for this, other than Dutton is courting Lambie’s swing vote on this. We were expecting a press conference on the party’s position on free trade agreements after a lively caucus debate this morning, but it has now been called off. We are still waiting to get the details of what has been agreed upon, but expect something on scrapping old investor state dispute settlement clauses with Indonesia, independent economic analysis of the trade deals, and a concession on future labour market access. The unemployment figures are out That vote Paul Karp has been telling you about, on the $4bn education investment fund, is happening. Labor created it when it was in government. The Greens put in a motion to protect it. Labor is voting against the motion. Jacqui Lambie is ESPECIALLY pissed about it. Jacqui Lambie has just got stuck into the deal struck between the Coalition and Labor – describing it as “pretty pathetic” that Labor has agreed to abolish a $4bn education investment fund in return for $50m for Tafe. “I can get more out of the government with just one of me, than all of you put together,” Lambie said. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says the $50m is “measly” and criticises Labor, which she said “used to be the party of public education”. Mathias Cormann has moved the bill out of the committee phase and is now setting a limit on the time for debate – so we’re going to have a final vote by 11.45. Is there anyone in this building not having a tantrum right now? If so, feel free to swing by the Guardian office for a chocolate. Because this whole place is one giant sulk right now, on all sides. Like I said, totally and absolutely, fine. Everything is fine. The Labor senator Murray Watt has revealed that the opposition has done a deal with the government to pass the emergency response fund bill, which abolishes the education investment fund and redirects it to “future emergency response and natural disaster recovery”. The bill is now being debated in the Senate – where the Greens attempted to stop its progress with amendments saving the education investment fund, and Jacqui Lambie has an amendment that limits the amount that can be taken to three-quarters of the education investment fund. Watt has moved opposition amendments that reflect the deal – to increase the quantum of the emergency response fund and lift the amount it can pay out each year from $150m to $200m, with the extra $50m to be spent on “disaster preparedness and mitigation infrastructure”. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, thanked the opposition for their “constructive engagement” on the bill, indicating that the government will support the opposition amendments. Cormann explains that an extra $50m will be given “to establish a $100m Tafe revitalisation grants program in partnership with the states”, with 50/50 funding from the states. It seems the same $50m is being characterised as about disaster mitigation infrastructure and upgrading Tafes! But – in any event – a deal has been done so we expect the bill to pass this morning. It’s safe to say not all members of Labor’s movement are happy with the party’s decision to support the Indonesian free trade agreement. Joel Fitzgibbon also notes that while the FHA changes are being put into the parliament today, the Senate doesn’t sit again until November. He says the lump sum payments are not enough and the government’s response has not been enough. It is putting its budget surplus in front of the livelihoods of Australian farmers. Joel Fitzgibbon continues: Labor will use ... every mechanism available to it to try to prevent the government from taking people of the modest Farm Household Allowance and obviously they could be constitutional restrictions on what we can do in the parliament because it is effectively a money bill, proposition to spend more money, but I will make this point about that, while we may be barred from making amendments which have fiscal implications, restoring the payment for these families until this drought breaks, and we all pray outcomes in the not too distant future, is a modest amount of money, a very modest amount of money, in proportion to the total commonwealth budget. And if the prime minister wants to maintain this fiction, so loose with the truth is he, that he is spending $7bn on drought, then people everywhere will be asking well, why prime minister do you find it necessary to cut, cut these farming families’s of this modest payment. Joel Fitzgibbon: The time for in action and talking is behind us. It is time now to act in a meaningful way and I make the appeal to the prime minister again. Establish a bipartisan rural cabinet, drought cabinet, drought advisory committee – whatever he wants to call it – because the opposition understands the seriousness of the situation the country now faces. This really is approaching a wartime-like situation. And we stand ready to work with him to make the decisions that will be necessary to ensure another farming families can stay on the land, that rural communities can survive, and we can secure our food sources in this country without becoming too dependent on the importation of our food and fibre. Joel Fitzgibbon says the government’s response to the farm household allowance was “not good enough”, describing it as “modest” and “inadequate”. Dipping into state politics for a moment, because of the review Anthony Albanese has ordered into NSW Labor: Earlier today, Kaila Murnain tendered her resignation as General Secretary of the NSW Labor Party. The terms of the separation agreement are confidential, but consist of Ms Murnain’s basic legal entitlements. The full terms of the settlement will be reported to the next meeting of the Administrative Committee. The Party is actively considering seeking the recovery of all of its costs related to the Inquiry, including the sum payable to Ms Murnain, under its insurance policies and from its previous lawyers. A new branch secretary will not be elected until the review into the branch currently being conducted by Professor Michael Lavarch has provided its recommendations on the role of the General Secretary. Joel Fitzgibbon will hold a press conference at 10.45 today to give Labor’s response to the government’s latest drought announcement. Speaking of Ed Husic, you might remember that yesterday’s blog included a speech he made to the federation chamber about the rise of rightwing extremism – which is exactly what Asio warned about in its public annual report, released late yesterday. Ed Husic, talking to Sky, says there is “very little modelling” done on the trade agreements but Labor will “support them, because it is the right thing to do”. He says Labor wants to keep a close eye on “what they do to jobs” but that the agreements open up markets in way they haven’t been previously. Today’s announcement also might help explain why Josh Frydenberg yesterday called the drought the “biggest call on the budget”. Obviously, as the treasurer, he knew this was coming. From a money point of view, it’s still not – but it is certainly the reason he has had to rework quite a few figures lately. Bridget McKenzie gets to put the release out on it: Today the Australian Government introduced improvements to the Farm Household Allowance (FHA) that will help more farmers through periods of hardship. This is our next step in responding to the Independent Review of FHA which will see more than 30,000 farmers able to access this immediate support. Minister for Agriculture, Senator Bridget McKenzie said the changes extended farming families’ access the FHA from three years in their lifetime to four years out of every 10, recognising that farmers experience hardships, including droughts, more than once in their lives. “...A one-off drought relief payment of up to $13,000 for a farming family, and up to $7,500 for an individual is designed to help people determine whether they will be sustainable, should look at succession options or, in some instances choose to sell. “For the first time, we’ll link farm enterprises with their directly-related businesses and consider income and losses together – not just income – a big change in how Government support payments are provided to families. “Our Government had already made changes to make the FHA quicker and easier to access by reducing paperwork by a third and by temporarily increasing farm assets threshold to $5 million from 1 July 2019. “It is all part of the radical simplification of the FHA application process and key policy settings that the Prime Minister announced on 27 September.” These improvements include: a simplified assets test a significant redesign of the application process and form, including allowing farming couples to apply using the same form a strengthened case management approach to better support farmers in hardship through periods of financial difficulty. ...The FHA has been supporting Australian farmers since July 2014. It has paid more than $365 million to around 12,700 recipients in that time. David Littleproud, who had some interesting things to say about “metropolitan commentators” who were “frothing at the mouth” this morning *cough*, is now introducing those FHA changes in the chamber. Scott Morrison has announced changes to the farm household allowance – on the John Laws Sydney radio 2SM (who is not Alan Jones, you might note) show. At the end of the four years (the current time allowed for the payment, which essentially is welfare for farmers, and is paid at the same rate as Newstart) farmers will receive a lump sum payment of $7,500 for singles, and $13,000 for couples. Peter Dutton is speaking to the media and he says he feels there may be “some complacency” around security, because “thank God”, Australia has not been the scene of a major terrorist attack within its borders. He’s addressing Duncan Lewis’s parting call – to publicly request more money for Asio, noting that the resources were strained in the *public* report, as well as warning of a growing rightwing terrorism threat. Dutton blamed Labor for cutting Asio’s budget (Labor has not been in power since 2013) and said the government had been putting that money back. The prime minister is talking to John Laws on 2SM, but none of us can listen in, because the 2SM site is down. AAP on the NDIS announcement: The next boss of the agency responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a former senior NSW bureaucrat. Martin Hoffman, who has been both a commonwealth deputy secretary and secretary of the NSW Department of Finance, Services and Innovation, will take up the job from November 4. He has also held roles in the private sector, including as chief executive of Ninemsn. NDIS Minister Stuart Robert said Mr Hoffman has the “dedication, vision and expertise” to lead delivery of the transformational scheme. “He will build on the ground-breaking work already underway and will make a real difference in delivering on the government’s commitment to realising the full benefits of the scheme for participants,” the minister said. Labor had this week put pressure on the coalition to appoint a new leader for the National Disability Insurance Agency, with its previous chief executive Robert De Luca resigning in April. “It is literally leaderless,” opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten told the lower house on Monday night. The organisation’s deputy chief executive Vicki Rundle had been acting in the top job since Mr De Luca’s resignation. Mr Hoffman has been appointed for a three-year term. Labor has voted to support the Indonesian free trade agreement, at the end of its shadow caucus meeting. Jim Chalmers was asked about Josh Frydenberg’s interview on his way into parliament his morning: The weakness in the Australian economy isn’t primarily because of weakness in the global economy, it’s primarily because the Morrison government doesn’t have a plan. Too many Australians are looking for work or for more work because the economy is floundering on the Liberals’ watch. Business knows, and the community knows, that we won’t get the economic growth we need to create good jobs while the government continues to sit on its hands. The call to parliament has sounded. Huzzah. Stuart Robert has called a doorstop to discuss this at 9.45. Asked for some of those specifics, Fiona Simson told the ABC it was about planning for the future, while looking at ways farmers could diversify their businesses: So, certainly, I think it’s about looking at how we farm now in Australia. How sustainable that is. It’s about looking at add to those income streams. It’s about supporting. We’re looking at, for example, at the moment we can create perhaps energy, we can create income streams from energy on underground gas … We know that there’s, you know, for example, solar energy can save farmers enormous amounts of money. It’s about looking at planning for drought on a regular basis. [It’s about] how can we make sure that farmers have access to, to to infrastructure on farms, and there’s a whole suite of measures that we want to discuss with the government, but it’s not just about farmers. It is also about rural regional communities. Because if we’re going to relieve the population pressures in the city, if we’re going to really truly build our regional communities at the moment – we’re talking about indoor agriculture, for example, with vertical farming … There’s many things we need to look at, Hamish, and that they need to be done together collaboratively, not in this sort of one government at a time, with the industry out of the room and communities out of the room. We need to plan for it. Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, also had a chat to ABC radio this morning. Here is some of what she had to say about the drought policy: [Policies] are being developed in a vacuum because there’s no real effective way of measuring whether or not these these measures have been robust. When we get to the end of a drought, and we’ve done it before, we’ve done it recently in the millennial drought, then we just sort of seemed to go that one’s over, pick up our pieces and and wait for the next rather than thinking every day – how can we make a rural and regional communities more resilient? How can we make our farmers, our really important food- and fibre-growing people, more resilient? How can we keep jobs in the in the country areas? How can we make sure that people have access to fresh water, which is just a first world sort of thing? And these are things that our strategy, which involves all levels of government, working together hand in hand on a regular basis with the community, with farmers, to actually get, you know, put in a new way, a new paradigm of dealing with drought in Australia … I’ll just finish the that no other government has been able to do this yet. It is an incredibly difficult space to work in. And look, we are really grateful for the Morrison government’s commitment to look at this and to work with us in developing this new strategy. And this new way of treating drought in Australia. There has also been a bit of chatter this morning about Josh Frydenberg’s interview with Phil Coorey in the Fin, in the lead-up to his attendance at the IMF meeting in Washington. It’s an extension of what he was saying yesterday, in response to calls for stimulus after the IMF’s downgrade of Australia’s economic growth outlook. The promised surplus is now being billed as an “economic buffer”. “A strong budget position helps build the resilience of the economy for external shocks, whenever that may occur, and your ability to respond to those shocks with a fiscal response,” Frydenberg told the Australian Financial Review. I am not sure that is going to calm the calls for stimulus, given the economy’s position, but you can start to see the narrative they are building – stimulus is coming, but it will be after the surplus, and what the government considers “good” stimulus (“bad” stimulus, in this scenario being painted, was Labor’s response after the GFC). The attorney general, Christian Porter, will introduce amendments to native title today. From his release: The native title legislation amendment bill 2019 implements a range of measures recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). It was also informed by extensive consultation with native title claimants who said they wanted more flexibility and efficiency built into the system. The bill will provide claimant groups with:  Improved pathways for dispute resolution following a determination of native title;  Increased transparency and accountability for prescribed bodies corporate (the corporations set up to manage native title);  Greater flexibility for bodies corporate to set their own internal processes. Importantly, the bill also seeks to end the uncertainty created by a 2017 full federal court judgment that cast doubts over the validity of hundreds of what are known as “section 31” agreements, which are negotiated between claimant groups and industry to facilitate land access. The McGlade decision found that such agreements were only valid if they were signed by all representatives of a claimant group, rather than by a majority – even if the only reason for not obtaining every signature was because a single representative had died. The bill will validate all affected agreements and ensure that a majority of representatives can negotiate on behalf of a claimant group in the future. For some history on this issue, you can head here. I told you drought was going to be the issue of the day. I’m listening to Hamish Macdonald interview David Littleproud on RN, and it sounded as though Littleproud just took a swipe at some city media types, saying that “while I get a lot of metropolitan commentators are frothing at the mouth at the moment” in regards to the drought and what needs to be done, says we “need to be careful” not to scare the next generation from entering agriculture as a career. Macdonald pulled him up on the “metropolitan commentators ... frothing at the mouth” comment. HM: To be perfectly fair, having spent a fair amount of time in drought-affected regions recently, I mean, that is what you hear when you go there – I mean, I don’t think it is just metropolitan commentators saying this sort of stuff [that more needs to be done], people on farms are quite desperate at the moment; are you sort of diminishing their plight by suggesting that? DL: Totally not, Hamish. I don’t have the comfort of tucking myself into a bed in a metropolitan [area], I actually live and breath it every day, my friend. I actually see these people and I know them by face and by name. These are resilient people. And they believe in what they do and they know what they are doing is the best in the world. Now we are going through a tough time and we’ve continued to have these conditions over our whole agricultural history, but we’ve faced up to them, and we’ve continued to work through them. So we will get through this, and when people say they want hope, then it is about leadership of hope and saying we will get through this, your government will stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this, and we will get you through, in the here and now ... the community and the future, that is why we are going to prepare to get them through this one and prepare them to get through the next one. While it is not unusual for National MPs to talk down about metro journalists with the “latte sippers” line alive and well in Michael McCormack’s world, Littleproud’s comment is interesting given its timing. The conservative Sydney 2GB radio host Alan Jones had quite the combative interview with Scott Morrison on Monday on the issue of the drought, loudly interrupting with “how is that going to feed cows?” as Morrison detailed his government’s spending, and then, when talking about the drought on his Sky News show the next night, broke down crying. I’m not sure if that counts as “frothing at the mouth” but I’m also pretty sure there will be some raised eyebrows when the comment gets back to some of those metropolitan offices. Meanwhile, Paul Karp had this story late yesterday, after taking a look through the Asio annual report: The threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased in recent years and will remain an “enduring threat”, according to Australia’s spy agency. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation issued the warning in its latest annual report, adding that “extreme rightwing groups in Australia are more cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years”. The comments amp up the agency’s concern about rightwing extremist terrorism, after Asio boss Duncan Lewis told Senate estimates in April it was an important issue but the Christchurch massacre had not changed the agency’s calculus. Asio has also reported a strain on its resources, with more calls for advice. Kristina Keneally told the ABC the security agency had sounded an “alarm bell”. “It’s an incredibly important agency in our national security framework and for them to be reporting in this time when the challenges they face are quite complex, that they are stretched for resources, well that’s an alarm bell,” she said. Labor MPs have been called to a special meeting of caucus at 8.30am this morning to decide their position on three new free trade agreements. The meeting comes after a working group of shadow ministers and union leaders held meetings on Wednesday afternoon to try to work through concerns over the Indonesian FTA. Labor is expected to endorse the enabling legislation but a number of MPs from both the left and right factions will push for the party to demand concessions on labor market access and skills testing. It’s expected to spark a heated debate in caucus, particularly given that elements of the agreements are at odds with the party’s national platform. The ACTU has been spearheading lobbying efforts to get the deals knocked off, raising fears about future market access for temporary visa holders under the Indonesian deal. The shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, has been clear that she wants the party to support the agreements but may be forced to adopt a new negotiating position to appease the concerns of caucus. We will know more later this morning. Welcome to the last sitting day for this week. After the parliament rises today, senators will turn their attention to Senate estimates next week, while the House will sit alone. But the ongoing drought looms large over everything being done in this building at the moment, with the government repeatedly forced to defend their strategy. Yesterday, on Sky, Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon called for a drought “war cabinet”. The government says it is working with everyone it can to deliver its policy. The National Farmers’ Federation released its own drought plan late yesterday, after repeated calls to plan for the future. From Sarah Martin: Under the policy, the NFF framework proposes that industry, community groups and the three tiers of government all work together in developing a drought strategy. This would identify specific drought measures that need to be maintained, amended or reviewed; and to propose new drought measures, build on the Coag national drought agreement and incorporate lessons learned from past droughts, create a drought forum and establish a drought committee. “While this national drought policy comes too late to help those managing this drought, the NFF is determined to see that we don’t find ourselves, once again, without a plan for drought,” the NFF’s Fiona Simson said. “We continue to consult with the government about further measures to assist farmers during this drought, including recommendations for commonwealth support for local government rate relief.” David Littleproud, speaking to the ABC this morning, says the government “already has” a drought strategy. “Our response has been one of being responsive to the situation,” he said. This is not an issue that is going anywhere. And it is only going to get bigger, with no rains in sight. We’ll bring you that, as well everything else that happens today. Mike Bowers is, as always, up and about, cameras in hand, while Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp will also be burrowing away on stories. You’ll catch me on the socials, and, when I get a chance, in the comments. And of course, the coffee line. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/presidents-paris-climate-speech-annotated-trumps-claims-analysed","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-02T01:42:40Z","webTitle":"Fact check: Trump's Paris climate speech claims analyzed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/presidents-paris-climate-speech-annotated-trumps-claims-analysed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/presidents-paris-climate-speech-annotated-trumps-claims-analysed","fields":{"headline":"Fact check: Trump's Paris climate speech claims analyzed","bodyText":"So we’re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine. So that’s that. After months of fevered speculation and lobbying, Trump sticks to his campaign pledge to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. He does so with a caveat that’s delivered rather casually – the US will renegotiate this pact, or maybe some other pact, aimed at ensuring the future liveability of the planet. But if it doesn’t work out, that’s OK. Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7m lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates. Trump’s vision of a hobbled America, ransacked by pointless environmental regulation, draws upon a highly disputed study published in March. National Economic Research Associates has done work for front groups for coal companies in the past and this study was at the behest of the American Council for Capital Formation, which counts Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and Charles Koch as major donors. The Paris agreement itself places no “energy restrictions” on the US – it’s a voluntary agreement that leaves it up to countries to decide how to cut their emissions. But several economists have warned that leaving the Paris agreement will stymie clean energy investment and ensure the production of solar panels and wind turbines – the very blue-collar jobs Trump claims to value – will take place in China rather than the US. It could get worse still – some countries are mulling a carbon “tariff” on US goods over Trump’s decision to swim against the energy transition that is underway. None of this will help a coal industry that was in decline long before the Paris deal. This is perhaps why business support for Paris is broad, uniting the likes of Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Apple and even BP. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years – 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. Trump repeatedly touches on a familiar theme of the US being taken advantage of by foreign ingrates. The Paris deal was considered a breakthrough because it required all nations to curb their emissions – including, crucially, China and India. Given that both these countries do not have more than a century of mass industrialization behind them, unlike the US, their commitments should be seen in context. Indeed, recent analysis has shown that China may have already peaked its coal use and will be reducing its emissions sooner than expected, although suspicions linger over its accounting methods. Either way, both China and India have reiterated their commitment to the Paris deal in recent weeks and are investing heavily in renewable energy. That they are doing this with tens of millions of their people still without electricity and other basic services shows that perhaps it isn’t terribly unfair to expect the world’s wealthiest nation to do likewise. In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. According to the Department of Energy, there are about 373,000 Americans working in solar energy – more than double that of the coal industry. The coal sector has been shedding jobs for decades, driven by automation of work and, more recently, the abundance of cheap natural gas. Major coal mining firms have conceded those jobs aren’t coming back and it’s not quite clear how American mining jobs can be shifted overseas given the US isn’t a coal exporter and US power plants aren’t crying out for extra minerals to keep the lights on. What’s more likely, according to economists, is that growth in renewable energy innovation and construction jobs will tip overseas, probably to China, which has committed to investing $360bn in the sector in the coming years. Our country will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. This dark vision would perhaps approach reality if a.) the only source of electricity in the US was coal, rather than a mix of nuclear, gas, coal and renewables, b.) the Paris agreement set any sort of binding limit on energy sources, and c.) the US government followed through with this by shutting down power plants rather than asking states to submit plans to transition away from polluting fossil fuels (as the Obama administration did). None of that has actually happened or was slated to happen. Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree – think of that; this much – Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. White House “talking points” distributed before Trump’s speech cite MIT research for the 0.2-degree reduction. This prompted a swift rebuttal from the actual source, a collaboration between MIT and Climate Interactive. The researchers point out the reduction in expected warming from emissions cuts promised at Paris will be 0.9 degrees by 2100, not 0.2 degrees. This still won’t be enough to avoid breaching the warming limit set out in the Paris deal but it’s worth considering that 0.9C is roughly the global temperature rise experienced since the industrial revolution. People living in southern Florida, or Bangladesh or beside a coral reef that provides food and a livelihood would have radically different lives if the global temperature increase was double its current level. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We’ll be the cleanest. We’re going to have the cleanest air. We’re going to have the cleanest water. Under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has paused or scrapped rules that prevent the dumping of mining waste into streams, curb emissions from vehicles and power plants and stop mercury and arsenic seeping into waterways. The EPA’s proposed budget also cuts measures that prevent lead in drinking water and also scraps clean-ups of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico and shrinks the funding of enforcement of pollution rules. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement. In common with some other policy areas, Trump seems to be believe his negotiating skills can overcome issues that leaders have grappled with for years. Paris came about after 20 years of often painful incremental manoeuvrings that included the disappointment of Copenhagen in 2009, and world leaders have already made clear they aren’t “thrilled” at the prospect of reversing this breakthrough. France, Italy and Germany released a statement saying that the Paris deal can’t be redone, while the EU and China jointly declared the agreement was “irreversible”. The UK, Canada and Australia all reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement with Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, saying he is “deeply disappointed” with Trump’s decision. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called it a “major disappointment.” The US may return to Paris, with Trump or a future president, but there will be lingering diplomatic damage that will haunt the country on the international stage far more than the Kyoto reversal under George W Bush. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? Well, at this point there’s certainly not much laughter. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Here, Trump seems to confuse the venue of the UN climate agreement signing for the actual subject of the accord. It’s also worth noting that Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh, committed the city to the Paris deal, along with dozens of other US municipalities, after Trump’s announcement. About 65,000 people in Pennsylvania work in the renewable energy industry, more than mining, oil and gas combined. Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated. Again Trump portrays the Paris deal as an onerous ball and chain around the ankle of a struggling America, which somehow isn’t now one of the world’s leading polluters. The climate fund is voluntary and Barack Obama pledged about $3bn to it. Given the scale of the climate challenge – rising seas, drought and disasters are already estimated to displace about 20 million people a year, according to the UN – even this funding is likely to be insufficient. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. One of the – ultimately successful – arguments put by opponents of the Paris deal to Trump was that his domestic agenda of revoking Obama-era environmental regulations would be jeopardised by the agreement. Architects of the deal have disputed this, pointing out that it is voluntary and non-binding and would carry no weight in a US court. Ultimately, the only recourse to Trump’s decision will be through the ballot box. The notice period for withdrawing from the Paris deal expires in November 2020 – the month of the next presidential election. Climate change will likely be, for once, a live issue at the election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jan/18/neither-trump-nor-turnbull-can-turn-back-the-tide-on-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-17T22:43:54Z","webTitle":"Neither Trump nor Turnbull can turn back the tide on renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/18/neither-trump-nor-turnbull-can-turn-back-the-tide-on-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/18/neither-trump-nor-turnbull-can-turn-back-the-tide-on-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Neither Trump nor Turnbull can turn back the tide on renewables","bodyText":"The inauguration of President Trump this Saturday (Australian time) marks a radical change in the world as we know it. It ushers in the beginning of four years where progressive issues as far reaching as race equality, women’s health, nuclear and foreign policy, and of course climate change will be under sustained attack. Less than a year after the world agreed a historic climate pact in Paris, the US – the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter – elected a man who wants to revive the glory days of coal, oil and gas. To less fanfare here at home, the Turnbull government is pursuing a similar trajectory. Ploughing through the headwinds is our resources minister, Matt Canavan, who is seeking a $100bn investment in coal and is the biggest campaigner for a new mega-coalmine in Queensland’s Galilee basin run by the Indian company Adani. The truth is that try as they might, neither Trump nor the Australian government can turn the tide on renewable energy, nor resuscitate an ailing coal industry with a clear expiration date. This is not a moral or political case, but a purely economical one. This is why I remain quietly optimistic about the continued global transition away from fossil fuels despite the hostile political climate. Renewable energy is rapidly becoming the cheapest and easiest way of producing energy in countries around the world. Investors everywhere are watching these changes and the market is responding rapidly. China has recently announced that it will invest US$361bn into renewable energy over the next four years, creating 13m jobs in the process. This is as much as the entire globe spent on renewables over the past four years. This makes good financial sense as well, since the cost of building large-scale solar has decreased by about 40% since 2010, making it cheaper than coal. Meanwhile, fossil fuels have become a leading cause of death globally, just behind tobacco. Indeed, air pollution from coal caused 770,000 premature deaths last year in China and India alone. Tell that to Matt Canavan next time he waxes poetic about the virtues of coal in developing economies. Together these factors add up to what a University of Queensland economist, John Quiggin, says is a continuing trend away from coal that will only pick up speed. “Until relatively recently, coal-fired electricity generation has been commercially successful,” he says. “That’s changing fast around the world due to the combination of carbon prices, competition from renewables and restrictions on particulate emissions. Taken together, these factors make it uneconomic to build a new coal-fired power station anywhere in the world.” Bypassing government, many investors and businesses in Australia and around the world are now asking just how quickly this transition will happen. Over the past few decades it has been almost commonplace for new technologies in a range of sectors to erode the competitive advantages of incumbents incredibly quickly. A great example that could provide an interesting case study for the potential of renewable energy is LED lighting. In 2010 LED lights had only 1% of the US market. With clever government incentives and regulation encouraging the transition, almost overnight the market shifted. Within five years, LED lights had moved into almost 60% of the market, making it one of the fastest technology shifts in human history. The trajectory was remarkably similar to what we are seeing with renewable energy now. While the Turnbull government’s bungling of federal energy policy is stifling some of the potential for clean energy developments, many Australian business leaders are steaming ahead regardless. Australia is the best country on the planet for solar energy and the former BHP executive Phil Galloway is looking to capitalise on that. He has plans to roll out 220,000 solar panels across the empty space on an almond farm in regional Victoria, generating enough electricity to power about 30,000 homes. Inspired by the model adopted in the US by companies such as Google and Apple, Galloway would look to negotiate power-supply agreements directly with large local companies rather than energy retailers. This is just the sort of project that is not only becoming more viable but, with a bit of clever government incentivisation, could transform Australia’s energy future and create a clean energy transformation that would create countless new, sustainable jobs across the country. A similar project is under way in the sleepy Victorian town of Yackandandah. Residents there have come together under the banner of 100% renewable energy and energy sovereignty to pursue a transformation of their own. Working with AusNet, which runs the Victorian grid, the town will trial new storage technology along with setting up a renewable energy farm to power it, with profits from the energy generated being ploughed back into their community. This is one of dozens of community renewable energy projects that are quietly driving Australia away from polluting energy. Likewise, in the northern rivers region of New South Wales, a community-owned energy company is seeking to offer a clean alternative to the dirty energy produced by Australia’s big three energy retailers: AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia. Enova Energy is making inroads not only to kickstart renewable energy but also to empower energy consumers. Headed by former executive heavyweights disillusioned by the government’s inaction on renewables, including Alison Crook, a former Monash University deputy chancellor and Qantas businesswoman of the year, Enova’s mission is to offer the country’s highest feed-in tariffs and lowest GreenPower price while working with social welfare groups to tackle energy poverty in the region. Our governments may now be held hostage by visionless representatives more determined on prosecuting their narrow ideological agenda than helping Australia find solutions to its most pressing issues but, elsewhere, leaders in other fields are transforming the way we generate, share and manage our energy needs and addressing climate change. Bellicose political rhetoric can’t hide the economic fact: renewable energy is the future. My advice for Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull is this: find an economic reason to justify being part of the clean energy revolution to the deniers around you or watch as investors, businesses and communities steamroll right over you."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/09/australians-fear-coalition-is-not-taking-climate-change-seriously-poll-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-09T14:01:03Z","webTitle":"Australians fear Coalition is not taking climate change seriously, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/09/australians-fear-coalition-is-not-taking-climate-change-seriously-poll-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/09/australians-fear-coalition-is-not-taking-climate-change-seriously-poll-shows","fields":{"headline":"Australians fear Coalition is not taking climate change seriously, poll shows","bodyText":"Australians are deeply worried the Abbott government is underestimating the importance of climate change, new polling shows, as cabinet debates crucial long-term targets for greenhouse gas reductions. The annual polling by the Climate Institute thinktank reveals Australians overwhelmingly support wind and solar energy – as the Coalition seeks to limit support for both – and see it as inevitable that coal-fired power stations will have to be phased out and replaced. But at the same time, almost half those surveyed (47%) think Labor’s carbon policies will “just increase electricity prices and not do much about pollution”. Labor has not announced a costed or detailed policy but has said it will reintroduce an emissions trading scheme and aim for 50% renewable energy by 2030. Federal cabinet will on Monday decide on the post-2020 emissions reduction target Australia will take to the UN Paris talks in December and the decision will then be presented to the Coalition party room. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who leads the climate negotiations, and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, have been arguing that Australia needs to adopt an emission reduction target broadly in line with those already tabled by the US and Canada – a reduction of between 25% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030 – but others in cabinet have expressed concern that the government won’t get any political credit from taking on an ambitious goal. And once the government commits to a target it will be under pressure to explain the policy it intends to use to meet it, with business groups, thinktanks and market analysts all arguing the Direct Action policy would need substantial modification before it was up to the task. Business groups have been lobbying fiercely for the government to drop its opposition to the purchase of carbon credits from overseas. Labor has not promised bipartisan support to a “lowball” target but has also not yet outlined a costed policy to reach a long-term climate goal. Findings from the Climate Institute research include: Australians are concerned that the seriousness of climate change is underestimated by the government (59% agree, 32% strongly agreeing, 16% disagree). 63% think the Abbott government should take climate change more seriously, up six points from 2014. 71% of Australians agree “it is inevitable that Australia’s current coal-fired generation will need to be replaced” (13% neutral, 5% disagree, 11% don’t know). 72% agree governments need to implement a plan to ensure the orderly closure of old coal plants and their replacement with clean energy (7% disagree and 14% neutral). 65% agree that “reducing the investment in windfarms and householder solar power is the opposite of what is needed” (39% strongly agree,11% disagree). Solar is the most preferred energy source: when presented with eight sources, 84% of respondents place solar energy within their top three preferred options. This is up 2 points from 2014. Wind energy is the second most preferred option, with 69% supporting it in their preferred energy mix. Coal and nuclear are least preferred with only a 13% backing each as a top three choice. The polling, and the decision on Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction target, come after the Abbott government wound back the renewable energy target, instructed the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (which it had unsuccessfully tried to shut) to stop investing in solar and wind, and announced it would appoint a “wind commissioner” to handle complaints about noise from wind turbines and new scientific committee to investigate, again, their alleged impacts on human health. “This week’s decision on Australia’s initial post-2020 climate commitment comes as nearly two-thirds of Australian believe that the Abbott government should take climate change more seriously, a surge of 6% from last year,” said John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute. “Our research also shows the carbon tax spectre still has some sting but perhaps less than would be expected. A third (36%) agree they won’t vote for the ALP because they will bring back the carbon tax, with a quarter (24%) neutral and 28% disagreeing. “The government and the opposition have an opportunity to join mainstream Australian attitudes with climate commitments and policies which can limit carbon pollution, encourage renewable energy and clean up our energy system.” The US has said it will reduce greenhouse emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels in 2025 and aim for an 80% reduction by 2050. Canada says it will reduce its emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030. The EU says it will reduce emissions by 40% by 2030 relative to 1990 levels. The poll was a nationally representative online survey conducted by Galaxy Research 27-29 July 2015 among 1,016 Australians aged over 18. Its margin of error is +/- 3%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/31/biogas-projects-suspended-amid-uncertainty-about-renewable-energy-grants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-31T05:08:47Z","webTitle":"Uncertainty about Arena halts renewable energy projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/biogas-projects-suspended-amid-uncertainty-about-renewable-energy-grants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/31/biogas-projects-suspended-amid-uncertainty-about-renewable-energy-grants","fields":{"headline":"Uncertainty about Arena halts renewable energy projects","bodyText":"Renewable energy projects in Australia are already being suspended as a result of the two major parties’ plans to effectively abolish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). In an announcement this week to the Australian Stock Exchange, Geodynamics announced it was suspending two large biogas projects in Goulburn, New South Wales, and Mindarra, Western Australia. It told investors it was doing so because of uncertainty surrounding the possibility of getting grant funding for the projects in the future. “In light of recent announcements regarding policy changes to key federal government grant programs, the availability of grant funding is increasingly uncertain,” it said. “Without grant funding these two projects will not meet the targeted investment returns. As a result, following consultation with our customers, work on these projects has been suspended until there is certainty on grant funding availability.” Guardian Australia understands that if the cuts to Arena go through, Geodynamics will cancel the projects. The company said it calculated that the suspension of the two projects would impose a $4.69m hit to its value. The Coalition announced before the election it would save $1.3bn by removing the ability of Arena to make grants – essentially abolishing the organisation. Labor didn’t oppose the cuts, and included them in the savings it took to the election. The cuts now form part of the “omnibus” bill the government will introduce to parliament, which it says contains all the budget savings agreed to before the election by both parties. But Labor has indicated it might oppose the measure, since it doesn’t include an extra $300m for renewable energy projects that Labor took to the election. The project at Goulburn was planned to generate up to one megawatt of renewable energy from manure and other organic waste produced by a nearby sheep processing facility. It would have converted that waste into methane, which would then be burned in a power station built on the site to create electricity. The company said the project would have been the first biogas plant that generated electricity that offset grid-supplied electricity. The Mindarra project was similar, set to be built at a piggery, and would produce more power than was needed by the piggery, exporting the excess to the grid. Tom Quinn, executive director of the Future Business Council, said the issue affecting Geodynamics was likely to be already impacting a lot of other businesses trying to pursue renewable energy. “It’s surprising how early it is, but it’s also inevitable,” he said. “If they do go ahead with the Arena cuts, this is just the beginning. We’re going to see the best and the brightest of Australia’s renewables business going overseas unless we can keep Arena and have strong bipartisan support for it. “It’s very easy to talk about innovation but this is what innovation looks like in practice.” On Wednesday 190 members of Australia’s solar research community signed an open letter calling on both political parties to not proceed with the cut to Arena. “If Arena is debilitated then hundreds of people would lose their jobs within a year or two,” the researchers wrote. “In the longer term, Australia’s leadership in solar energy would vanish. This would be completely at odds with the government’s innovation agenda and its commitment at the Paris climate conference to double clean energy R&amp;D by 2020 under the international Mission Innovation program, and with the ALP’s climate change action plan launched in 2015 at UNSW Australia, and reinforced by opposition leader Bill Shorten at ANU also in 2015.” Geodynamics declined to comment on the announcement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/27/what-is-the-future-of-foreign-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-27T13:31:38Z","webTitle":"What is the future of foreign aid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/27/what-is-the-future-of-foreign-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/27/what-is-the-future-of-foreign-aid","fields":{"headline":"What is the future of foreign aid?","bodyText":"Should foreign aid continue? It’s a complex question. There are so many types of aid, and different countries have different models. The Chinese, for example, are committed to vast infrastructural programmes, particularly to do with transport and communications. Other countries take other approaches. No one is suggesting humanitarian aid should end. Catastrophe evokes a human response to help fellow creatures. When help is not possible, for example in ending the carnage in Aleppo, we feel frustration and despair that people suffer without respite. But the debate over the extent of aid and whether it should continue is concerned with wastage, corruption and dependency. It recognises that while much of western aid cultivates markets for exports, the overall effect appears to be enrichment of an elite. Poverty has been greatly reduced over the last decade, but the discrepancy between rich and poor seems to be growing. And, in many countries, the rich seem still to be committed to accumulation rather than to the circulation of capital and its investment in new enterprises that would generate employment. Where a proportion of aid leaks, it facilitates an elite that is not economically dynamic, merely rich. Critics, such as the global economist Dambisa Moyo, have long accused aid regimes of retarding rather than developing. Her critique is that aid creates dependency, and the sub-text is that this is precisely because western donors prefer it that way. An Africa, for instance, that develops through the vibrancy of its trade – in particular its manufactured products – would threaten western industries and the voter base of governments from both left and right. Aid is expressed in terms of a pious commitment, but is in fact a long-term selfishness. This is a powerful critique, but not every developing country has something to trade. Some are merely impoverished. Others are the site of intense competition for resource extraction: west and east seek Africa’s mineral resources for future industrial capacity. Africa sells those resources because it has been discouraged from developing industrialisation of its own. This discouragement has perverse and arcadian aspects – forms of romanticism. If Africa industrialised, it would add to world pollution. But this ignores the possibility of a generation jump in technologies. Africa as a leader in vast solar energy plants, for instance, requires a leap in imagination, and often involves skills not plentiful even in the west. The debate on aid comes down to this kind of lack of imagination. We have cemented in our minds the idea of a hierarchy in the world’s nations: the developing world is below us and we need to help them, preferably to our advantage. But we do not want them to rise above us. How many new Chinas can the west bear? Aid to this extent becomes a solidification of the current status quo. But if the mantra of “trade not aid” took off, the left would complain as industrial workers lost their jobs because of cheap imports from new manufacturers, while left and right would complain as new economic centres of power reduced our international capacity to influence others. It is we who would then become dependent. This is a debate worth conducting. No transformation will occur overnight. Certainly, Britain’s aid contribution seems set to diminish as it leaves the EU – and the multilateral funding schemes that have delivered quantities of aid to the outside world. But humanitarian aid should certainly not diminish. Here, the public can sometimes lead the governments of the west. I remember in 1991 walking by the Red Sea in front of the bombed-out ruins of the entire city of Massawa in Eritrea. As part of Ethiopia, the region had suffered greatly from the terrible famine of 1984. A young boy came to walk with me. In broken English he asked where I came from. When I replied, he said: “My father tells me that when I was born, we had terrible famine. He said a singer from your land tried to help us.” Bob Geldof’s name had disappeared, but a memory of him remained. If aid is often fearful of the future, and selfish, it is not always so.

On the other side of the Atlantic, a more modest, quieter challenger plans to take on the US electric car giant. Based within a railway arch, with the sound of trains running overhead from nearby London Bridge station and surrounded by other ecologically minded startups, the offices of Powervault are a far cry from Tesla’s showpiece Californian stage. The similarity lies in the product – the Powervault battery, which stores energy from domestic solar panels. “Some people, especially if they don’t have solar panels, just assume solar panels come with a battery,” says Joe Warren, Powervault’s managing director. They don’t. Home energy generation has blossomed in the UK over the past four years, with an estimated 650,000 homes fitted with solar panels. In 2010, the government introduced the feed-in tariff scheme to pay householders who produce and supply energy. The scheme aims to push renewable energy in the UK towards 15% of total energy by 2020. In 2009, the figure stood at 2%. Powervault, Tesla and other players in the emerging solar battery market aim to supply the means for householders to store energy produced during the sunniest part of the day for use at peak times, when more people are at home but the sun is down. “A lot of people are not at home during the day, they are at work,” Warren says. “The solar system is generating energy which is all exported. We thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you could store that energy and use it when you are at home in the evening?’ Our system stores energy during the day when it is sunny and then gives it back to the customer in the evening.” The Powervault unit is about the size of a washing machine and weighs about 150kg (330lbs). Inside are batteries, chargers and electronics. A charger takes the energy from the solar panels and transforms it into energy which is then stored in the batteries and discharged around the home when needed. “Typically the system works on a daily cycle so it charges up when it is sunny and then on that same day discharges,” Warren says. “It would typically store the energy for less than 24 hours. “It has a control system and a monitoring system which works out whether you are importing or exporting [electricity]. If you are exporting, it will charge the batteries until they are full and if it notices that you are importing electricity, it will start to discharge energy and reduce the amount of energy being imported from the grid by offsetting that with the energy in the battery.” The unit stores 2 to 4 kilowatt hours, enough energy to watch television for 14 or 28 hours or wash two to four full loads in the washing machine. Priced between £2,000 and £2,800 per unit, it is cheaper than rivals, says Warren, and it has been reduced in size to tailor it for the British home’s energy needs. “The main purpose is to reduce people’s electricity bills, to charge up during the day when it’s sunny, discharge it in the evening when people are using power. If you made the battery bigger, you could store the energy for longer but the problem with that is it would cost a lot more. What we have tried to do is size the unit so it is just right for a British house.” Savings from the device depend on consumption, the number of solar panels installed and how much energy they produce, although the company estimates that it could lower electricity bills by up to 15%. Warren said sales started in September, with devices snapped up by early adopters and people enthusiastic about green technology. Powervault is aiming to cut the cost to £1,000, making the savings on evolving battery technology and economies of scale. Warren says some estimates put the number of households with solar panels at 2m by 2020, by which time the company hopes to have sold 50,000 units. “What we are trying to do here is change the electricity market, change the way people consume energy,” says Warren. “The country and everybody [in it] are facing big challenges, we have got huge electricity cost increases that are affecting homeowners, are affecting the country. We need to get the carbon emissions of the country down, we need to ensure security of supply – all those things affect people and affect the country as a whole.” However, competition is expected to be harsh. Tesla’s wall-mounted Powerwall batteries are designed to store up to 10kW hours of wind or solar energy; units have sold out until mid-2016. It aims to have its batteries in the UK by the end of this year. Last month, Mercedes-Benz also entered the battery market for home and business use. Eco-entrepreneur Dale Vince, chair of the renewable energy firm Ecotricity, said the home battery market remained undeveloped until now because energy had been “too cheap for too long for it to matter”. Ecotricity is also developing a product – expected to be launched next year – with a working title of “black box”, a 2ft to 3ft-high device that will control power coming in and out of the home. The missing link Energy storage has been described as the missing link of solar energy adoption. A report from Deutsche Bank this year said solar energy storage would be cheap enough to be deployed on a large scale within five years as a result of a yearly cost reduction of 20% to 30% in the price of lithium-ion batteries. • You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/nov/14/hostels-to-high-end-the-australian-hotels-embracing-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-14T00:36:43Z","webTitle":"Hostels to high-end: the Australian hotels embracing renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/14/hostels-to-high-end-the-australian-hotels-embracing-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/14/hostels-to-high-end-the-australian-hotels-embracing-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Hostels to high-end: the Australian hotels embracing renewable energy","bodyText":"When it comes to the carbon impact of holidays, the focus has long been on the journey, not the destination. Yet a growing stable of accommodation providers in Australia are on a mission to change that, switching over en masse to renewable energy in a bid to attract eco-conscious holidaymakers. Hospitality operators are cottoning on to the fact that the natural features that draw tourists in also have the potential to power their hotels and hostels – from the solar and tidal capacity of beach getaways to the wind and geothermal power potential of mountainside hot spring resorts. Dozens of destinations have taken up solar PV in recent years, such as Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort in Queensland, which promotes its solar as part of an effort to save the Great Barrier Reef that guests are coming to visit, or the 1.8MW of solar panels installed at Ayers Rock Resort (with assistance of financing from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation) in a bid to capitalise on the desert heat. Tucked away in the Bass Strait separating mainland Australia from Tasmania, ecotourism destination Flinders Island is installing a tidal energy system to make the most of the waves that batter its coastline. Representing the wind sector is Wolgan Valley Resort up in the Blue Mountains near Sydney, where a turbine pumps water for guests from a nearby dam. Thomas Hillig, the managing director of THEnergy sustainable consulting, says the more far-flung holiday destinations of Australia are leading the way for a very practical reason – guests don’t want their downtime disrupted by noisy small-scale fossil fuel power sources. “At remote hotels that generate their power onsite with diesel generators, the advantages of renewables are most obvious,” he says. “Diesel gensets are loud and emit hazardous exhaust gas. In addition, trucks that transport the diesel to the hotel cause additional annoyance. “Wind and especially solar energy are clean and less noisy than diesel gensets. After they are constructed, fuel deliveries are not required.” Of course, just because the green credentials of the destination are suddenly a factor, it doesn’t mean the journey no longer counts and such remote destinations tend to involve long gas-guzzling car voyages or extended carbon-intensive flights. More accessible physically if not financially, high-end urban accommodations with the budget to do so are also going green, such as the solar thermal-powered Accor Group hotels at Sydney Olympic Park. Outside the luxury market, hostel chain YHA Australia has found a way to invest in renewables on a budget by following in the carbon footsteps of airlines that allow customers the option of paying extra to offset the emissions of flights. YHA’s Tom Smith says guests can opt to chip in towards the chain’s sustainability efforts, pointing to recent efforts by Sydney Harbour YHA as an example. “They’ve won award after award for sustainability and they’ve installed a great new PV solar panel system only in the last month or so – the panels were installed with 50% funding from YHA’s Sustainable Hostels Fund, which is generated by guests’ donations and matched dollar-for-dollar by YHA,” he says. Donations from the fund have gone towards solar hot water systems at YHA locations at Adelaide Central, Byron Bay, Cairns Central, Glebe Point, Pittwater, Grampians Eco Lodge, Melbourne Metro and Alice Springs. YHA has also been active on the sustainable front in New Zealand, where their hostel servicing the bubbling mud pools of Rotorua harnesses geothermal energy through a down-bore heat exchanger. The New Zealand YHA has also not forgotten about the journey, with its Low Carbon Traveller initiative having given away over 4,000 discounted nights to backpackers travelling on foot or by bike since 2011. Such efforts could prove lucrative for the hostel chain – the 2013 study Green Retail and Hospitality Report – Waste Management by McGraw-Hill Construction found that the core business of hotels is positively affected by green efforts. Hillig, whose THEnergy consultancy offers workshop and marketing programs to businesses within the hospitality and renewable-energy sectors globally, cautions that, despite all the progress down under, the region is by no means a world leader. “What we have not seen so far is a commitment from a hotel chain to fully switch to renewables such as the Melia group has done in Europe,” he says. He also thinks that the marketing potential of green energy in the tourism industry has not yet been fully harnessed by those taking it up. “The use of renewable energy also offers a great opportunity regarding communication and allows for attracting new target groups,” he says. “However, we see that many hotels do not play that card very actively. “Especially chains seem to be aware that they are still at the beginning of a development and that active communication on their first flagship renewable energy projects might raise questions regarding other establishments where they have not done anything yet.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-27T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"10 years on from the Stern report: a low-carbon future is the 'only one available'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","fields":{"headline":"10 years on from the Stern report: a low-carbon future is the 'only one available'","bodyText":"Clean, green development is the sole route to future global economic growth, according to British economist Lord Nicholas Stern, with a continuation of polluting, high-carbon growth only leading to self-destruction. There is a strong argument that China is now leading the world in action on climate change, Stern said, making the country both a competitor and inspiration for other nations. Stern, speaking ahead of two lectures to mark the 10th anniversary of the highly influential Stern report, said the cost of not acting to halt global warming had risen while the costs of doing so had fallen. The 2006 Stern report, commissioned by the UK government, found that the economic damage caused by unchecked climate change could be 5-20% of global GDP each year, but that cutting carbon emissions would cost just 1% of GDP. The report warned against delaying action, but this has not been heeded, said Stern on Thursday. “We have delayed action,” he said. “The potential damages now look bigger than I suggested then. In that sense I underplayed the consequences of not getting on with it. But the costs of action are a good deal lower than I indicated then, in that technical progress has been faster that we thought. The cost of solar power [for example] is not far off a factor of 10 less than in 2006.” Today, he said, a low-carbon future is the sole option for prosperity. “It is the only one available and it is a very exciting growth story,” Stern said. “Any attempt to follow high-carbon growth will eventually be self destructive due to the very hostile environment it creates. There was an old alleged tension between growth on the one hand and climate responsibility on the other, but it’s a completely fake horse race.” Stern said other drivers of economic growth, such as using interest rates, tax changes and structural reforms, had limited potential. “Sustainable development of infrastructure and cities is the growth story of the future,” he said. “We are winning the arguments intellectually and politically, but it has all been much too slow.” Stern foresees economies in which people travel using efficient self-driving cars, bicycles and walking, homes and businesses are powered by green energy, materials are widely recycled and ultrafast broadband supports home working. “It is a very attractive future if we just put our minds to it,” he said. “Cities where you can’t move and breathe make no sense.” Stern said China could be seen as the leader in climate action today. “You can make a strong case for that,” he said, noting Chinese coal use peaked two years ago. “You have radical change in energy and very big structural change in the economy, moving very strongly towards service sectors and high-tech.” He said a key driver is the threat to China from fossil fuel burning, both in terms of climate change impacts, particularly droughts and floods, and air pollution. “I wish the whole world had known [in 2006] how big an issue air pollution was. We kill millions a year, so delay on that has resulted in probably the deaths of tens of millions of people,” he said. “The double gain – both reducing the risk of climate change and reducing air pollution – is now seen as a very powerful and attractive argument for action. This argument has been particularly strong in its attraction in China, which has probably moved the most in the last 10 years.” Stern said China was also driven by the desire to be the biggest player in the green economy: “If there is a race in green products, China rather fancies itself to do well.” China already leads the world in wind and solar energy installations and also has a major nuclear power programme. “The future of nuclear will be determined in China as it is the only country doing it at scale,” Stern said, suggesting 100-150 new nuclear power plants could be built there in the next 15-20 years. The UK has been a leader on climate change, he said, both in its pioneering domestic laws passed in 2008 and in international negotiations towards the global Paris climate change agreement. “But the UK wobbled in 2015 in terms of support for renewables and that has created some uncertainty,” he said. Since coming to power, the Conservative government has drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power, leading the UK to fall down league tables ranking national energy sectors and attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Stern said all low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear, would be needed in the UK but that “solar and wind with storage is particularly promising”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/aug/22/alec-enterprise-car-rental-environmental-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-22T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"Enterprise Rent-A-Car becomes paid Alec member despite green efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/alec-enterprise-car-rental-environmental-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/alec-enterprise-car-rental-environmental-laws","fields":{"headline":"Enterprise Rent-A-Car becomes paid Alec member despite green efforts","bodyText":"It’s not easy enough being green for Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Though the auto rental service has trumpeted tree-planting initiatives and its fleet of hybrid vehicles, the Guardian has learned that Enterprise recently became a paying member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), the business consortium that sends legislators prefabricated drafts of laws tailored to obscure scientific discovery that might damage its members’ revenues, and help those members avoid environmental regulations. The Center for Media and Democracy’s Nick Surgey brought Enterprise’s membership in Alec to the Guardian’s attention. Surgey said that Enterprise initially claimed not to know about Alec’s positions on renewable energy and that he found those claims “frankly implausible”. “For us, the argument over whether global warming is a problem or not is over,” said Andy Taylor, at the time Enterprise’s CEO, in 2007. By contrast, the group of conservative businesses published an article called “A Review of Global Warming Science” expressing skepticism and promoted an article by the Competitive Enterprise Institute that same year that said there was “no ‘scientific consensus’ [quotes theirs] that global warming will cause damaging climate change.” Climate models characterized as inaccurate by climate change skeptics are currently accurately predicting changes in ocean heat accumulation. Alec has also vigorously attacked sustainable energy programs, proposing financial penalties for people who supply solar energy to their neighborhoods. Enterprise is a subsidiary of Enterprise Holdings, the company that also owns the auto rental services Alamo and National. Enterprise confirmed to the Guardian that the company pays for the anti-regulatory group’s advocacy to lawmakers. The company’s given reason was the avoidance of specific sales taxes. Spokeswoman Laura T Bryant said: “[P]lease understand that our relationship with Alec is solely focused on the car rental excise tax issue.” “As the world’s largest car rental company and a leader in the global travel industry, we are in a strong position to help drive sustainable travel solutions and policies around the globe,” writes Enterprise Holdings CEO Pam Nicholson in the letter that opens Enterprise’s 2015 sustainability report, which lists Enterprise’s accomplishments in the realm of renewable and sustainable energy. “That’s why customers and employees look to us to be responsible stewards of our business and the communities where we live and work.” In 2013, the Guardian revealed that Alec had promoted legislation financially penalizing people who installed solar panels on their homes, including charging homeowners with solar power for feeding electricity back into the grid where it could be used by other people. “They should be paying to distribute the surplus electricity,” Alec analyst John Eick said at the time. Last year, Alec brass told the group’s annual conference that reports of the decline of insect pollinators due to pesticides was overblown in a talk called “Beepocalypse Not” in San Diego. In February, a United Nations report jointly authored by dozens of experts from across the world found that exposure to pesticides and saturation in pesticides was a “well-established” cause of decline in populations of pollinators such as bees. Several high-profile donors including Ford, BP and Expedia have left the group despite its hardcore anti-tax stances. Enterprise wants to avoid taxes on car rentals; local politicians often tout those taxes as a way to transfer part of the tax burden from local residents to tourists and businesses in the area temporarily."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/24/favelas-solar-energy-projects-brazil","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-24T11:06:43Z","webTitle":"From the favelas: the rise of rooftop solar projects in Brazil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/24/favelas-solar-energy-projects-brazil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/24/favelas-solar-energy-projects-brazil","fields":{"headline":"From the favelas: the rise of rooftop solar projects in Brazil","bodyText":"Sunny days have long been considered a competitive advantage for Brazil. Before the 2014 World Cup, the country’s tourist board set up a website allowing visitors to compare the number of sunny days in US and European capitals to cities in Brazil (eg Brussels 103, Rio de Janeiro 212). But while tourism may have been capitalising on the sunshine, the solar industry has not. According to statistics from the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency, Aneel, solar accounts for just 0.02% of the country’s energy. The bulk of the country’s energy generation (70%) is from hydropower. However, while demand for energy is increasing, multi-year droughts and widespread blackouts have created serious concerns about energy security for millions of businesses and homes. Despite a traditional lack of support (unlike Europe, China and the US, Brazil has not implemented feed-in tariffs or tax breaks), the government is now making efforts to diversify (pdf) the country’s energy mix with recent public auctions for solar and wind. Its 10-year energy plan released in 2014 estimates that 7GW of solar projects will be installed by 2024, making up 3.3% of Brazil’s energy mix. Yet as Brazil struggles with deep recession, increasing public deficit and political paralysis, it could be smaller companies and social startups that fuel the spread of solar, especially in the favelas where access to electricity is not widespread. Boost for community solar New regulations that came into effect in March aim to clear the way to make people into both consumers and producers of clean, low-cost electricity. They allow people to set up co-operatives to install grid-connected solar systems and be financially rewarded for contributions to the grid. The regulations also seek to cut red tape by simplifying and speeding up procedures for setting up and connecting solar systems. One organisation likely to be a key beneficiary of the new regulations is Revolusolar. Located in Babilônia, a Rio de Janeiro favela in the Leme region of the city, it was founded in 2015 by a group of six local residents, aiming to bring green power to the people of the favela. Currently a non-profit, Revolusolar is hoping to become a co-operative later this year and is already supported by the Organization of Cooperatives in Brazil. “We live in an energy dictatorship dominated by big companies like [Brazilian oil giant] Petrobras. But this might soon change,” says Revolusolar co-founder Pol Dhuyvetter from the roof of his house, where he has just installed a set of 12 solar panels that he expects will supply 50% of his energy consumption. So far, 10 families have contacted the organisation to evaluate the eligibility of their homes for the grid-connected solar electric system. “It is difficult to understand how a country with such potential is not developing its solar energy system,” says Dhuyvetter. Solar’s promise for Brazil If panels were installed on the rooftops of every house in the country, solar energy could supply more than double the Brazilian residential demand, according to Rodrigo Sauaia, president of the Brazilian Solar Power Association (Absolar). He believes that the new regulations – for the first time establishing clear rules for community solar - combined with skyrocketing electricity costs due to droughts and over-dependence on hydropower energy will stimulate distributed generation in the coming years. “In 2015 we had only 1,731 small-scale solar systems connected to the grid, but we expect this number to grow to 1.2m in 2024,” he says. Environmental and social organisations such as Greenpeace have recently campaigned to push the Brazilian government to provide tax breaks for panels and loans to buy solar equipment, as high interest rates – currently 14.25% – threaten investment in renewables that take time to pay off. “There is a degree of reluctance from the government, but also a strong lobby [against solar] from major construction companies that finance political campaigns,” says Barbara Rubim, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil. These companies, some of which have an interest in the construction of huge, controversial dams such as the Belo Monte, have also become one focus of the country’s Lava Jato corruption investigation. Sauaia is confident society and small- and medium-sized companies will lead the charge. One such innovative small business is Sao Paulo-based Axis Renovaveis, which offers clients a solution to cut their energy bills: install tailor-made solar systems on their rooftops without investing a single cent. “We just ask them to sign a 10- to 12-year contract to commit to buy the electricity produced by the solar system, which could represent up to 50% of their total demand,” says Luiz Pacheco, one of the company founders. “We guarantee a cheaper price than the market and we assume all financing, installation and maintenance costs.” Axis Renovaveis has funding from banks and private investors to cover upfront costs. Pacheco argues that commercial clients – such as a major pharmacy retailer network – benefit from a 15% discount in their electricity expenses compared with previous bills. This creates an opportunity for a booming expansion of Pacheco’s business. “[Clients] have realised that they can easily save money in each of their hundreds of branches in the country. At the same time, they also contribute to the environment.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/07/why-coal-fired-power-handouts-would-be-an-attack-on-climate-and-common-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-07T00:48:42Z","webTitle":"Why coal-fired power handouts would be an attack on climate and common sense","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/07/why-coal-fired-power-handouts-would-be-an-attack-on-climate-and-common-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/07/why-coal-fired-power-handouts-would-be-an-attack-on-climate-and-common-sense","fields":{"headline":"Why coal-fired power handouts would be an attack on climate and common sense","bodyText":"The recent coordinated push for new coal-powered electricity generators in Australia comes as the industry is on its last legs. The intensified push for government handouts can be seen as a last-ditch attempt for the coal industry to squeeze some money out of the unwise investments it made at the end of the mining boom. Here are the facts and figures that point towards that conclusion. The coal industry knows that to stop runaway climate change all coal-powered generators need to close Australia joined 174 countries and the European Union in 2015, signing the Paris agreement. In doing so, Australia agreed to do its part in keeping the global temperature rise “well below” 2C. It also commits countries to achieving net-zero emissions “in the second half of this century”. That agreement, designed to stop runaway climate change, requires that all of Australia’s coal-fired generators close. According to the International Energy Agency, OECD countries such as Australia need to shut down almost all of their coal-fired power stations by about 2035. And the rest of the world will need to phase out coal power by 2050, it says. With coal-fired power stations taking up to a decade to build, and designed to last 30 or 40 years, building new ones now is obviously inconsistent with those commitments. In particular, Australia has committed to reducing its emissions by 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 – a commitment that is not strong enough to limit global warming at 2C and will need to be “ratcheted up”. But the Australian government recently released projections of the country’s carbon emissions showing that current policies are going to cause emissions to rise to 2030, not drop, leaving Australia overshooting that commitment by a long way. In producing those projections, the Department of Environment and Energy assumed that 2,000MW of coal capacity would retire between 2020 and 2030, and that the generation would be taken up by existing coal and some gas. (That’s equivalent to about two large power stations.) If, instead, even more coal is built, the already rising emissions would get even worse. Demand for coal for electricity has been dropping Meanwhile, even before coal generators begin to close, the demand for their power has been dropping as renewables enter the mix. According to data from the Office of the Chief Economist, the demand for coal-generated electricity has dropped by more than 15% in the past eight years. Moreover, New South Wales budget papers show that the state government has recently downgraded its projections for domestic consumption by a whopping 20%. Last year it estimated domestic consumption would be 30m tonnes a year for the next five years. This year it changed that estimate to just 24m tonnes each year. In response to the new figures, the NSW Greens’ energy spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, said: “Coal power has been in decline for nearly a decade and it is clear that no one is going to build a new coal-fired power station anywhere in Australia. “Coal is the whale oil of the 21st century and should be phased out as rapidly as possible for the sake of the climate.” New coal is the most expensive form of energy While the proponents of coal talk about coal power being “cheap and reliable”, they are wrong on both fronts. Coal is now the most expensive form of new power. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the cost of energy from a new coal power plant would be $134-$203/MWh. That’s more expensive than wind, solar or highly efficient combined-cycle gas (costing $61-$118/MWh, $78-$140/MWh and $74-$90/MWh, respectively). Coal is not ‘reliable’ anymore Whether or not an energy source is “reliable” depends on what you’re relying on it for. The only people who still think we need the old-fashioned sort of “baseload power” that coal provides – power that is always running regardless of whether you need it – are those in the coal industry. Coal power stations are slow to start up and so can’t respond efficiently to fluctuations in supply and demand. Old energy systems were built assuming coal would always be running. It was the “baseload” energy and other forms of energy such as gas would switch on to satisfy the peaks in demand. In a world where wind and solar energy can produce a lot of energy, but not constantly, baseload needs to be replaced with flexible power that can smooth out the spiky energy supply created by variable sources of renewable energy. In the short term, that can be gas. But, in the longer term, to stop runaway climate change, that service will need to be supplied by renewable sources such as battery storage, hydro, solar thermal with storage or geothermal. When competing with renewables, coal generators end up burning costly fuel, even when they are giving the electricity away for free. Leonard Quong from Bloomberg New Energy Finance said when releasing a recent report: “In the grid of the not-too-distant future coal’s baseload operation becomes a curse, not a blessing.” And Steven Holliday, the chief executive of the UK’s National Grid, recently said: “The idea of baseload power is already outdated.” The coalmining industry has a backlog of projects it can’t get off the ground According to the Office of the Chief Economist’s most recent Resources and Energy Major Projects Report, there are 37 major coalmining projects that are currently in the works. However, that number has dropped since the last report a year ago and, in that time, no new projects have moved from along the pipeline from being “committed” to “completed”. If all the projects still listed as being actively pursued were to reach completion, they would produce almost 300m tonnes of coal each year. Adam Walters from Energy &amp; Resource Insights said that list is a “salient reminder, if one is needed, that vast amounts of proposed new coal capacity, much with most approvals in place, remains waiting for a favourable market”. He said most of those projects were begun during the mining boom, when commodity prices were high. With prices depressed, they’ve stayed on the books but are not progressing. The push for rejuvenating the coal industry with government subsidies is the sort of thing that could help the industry get some of these projects back on track, Walters said. The global coal industry recently saw its biggest player, Peabody, go bankrupt in the US. If companies are forced to take write-downs for these projects by admitting they will never go ahead, it could mean the end for some of the companies. At his National Press Club address last week, Malcolm Turnbull appeared to point to this as the reason he is now looking to subsidise the most expensive and dirtiest form of energy, saying that it could help our mining industry. He said: “As the world’s largest coal exporter, we have a vested interest in showing that we can provide both lower emissions and reliable baseload power with state-of-the-art, clean, coal-fired technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/08/brighton-solar-powered-buses-electric","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-08T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"Brighton gears up for new fleet of solar-powered buses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/08/brighton-solar-powered-buses-electric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/08/brighton-solar-powered-buses-electric","fields":{"headline":"Brighton gears up for new fleet of solar-powered buses","bodyText":"The bright yellow Big Lemon buses are a familiar sight – and smell – on the roads of Brighton and Hove. For nine years the Community Interest Company has run all its vehicles on waste cooking oil from local restaurants, recycled into biodiesel, but now it wants to go one step further. The Big Lemon wants to install solar panels on the roof of its east Brighton depot, storing the energy in batteries and charging buses overnight. It is working with the Brighton Energy Cooperative (BEC) towards a vision of zero emissions bus services in every UK community by 2030, using Brighton as a pilot. The Big Lemon eventually wants to replace its 10 biodiesel buses, which are not suitable for conversion, and has already raised £250,000 of investment in a bond issue to do this, exceeding the original target of £100,000. The company has also been shortlisted for the M&amp;S Energy Community Energy Fund, which could bring up to £25,000 through a public vote and pledged donations from voters – the cost of the solar panel installation at the depot. The project is currently leading votes in the south and more than £9,490 has been pledged. UK’s first solar buses Although this is the first UK initiative of its kind, there are examples of electric buses across the country, including in London and Harrogate. The government has put £30m of funding towards helping bus operators and local authorities in England run more low-emission buses. “Electric bus technology has progressed quite far. We wanted to try that and embrace it,” says Tom Druitt, managing director of The Big Lemon. Biodiesel has a low carbon footprint but there are still emissions from the buses. Using electricity means almost no emissions. The key thing about The Big Lemon idea is that the energy will be generated on site. “If we run on mains electricity then we still have a large carbon footprint,” says Druitt, who is also a Green party councillor. The Big Lemon has decided to convert diesel buses to run on electric, instead of buying brand new electric buses. Work has begun on the first buses which were purchased for £20,000 each. With conversion costs of £140,000 each, Druitt says this approach is still cost effective as, depending on the brand, a new electric bus would cost between £250,000 and £500,000. Conversion also allows the company to have more say in the bus’s specifications. Druitt estimates that The Big Lemon will save around £20,000 a year in fuel costs, as well as a reduction in maintenance costs. “We’ve estimated that there’s a six-year payback on these buses and we’re calculating for an eight-year life span, so essentially we get two years free,” he explains. The panels for the initial project will generate 30,000kWh of electricity and will power the whole of the 52 route between Woodingdean and Brighton city centre. The Big Lemon wants to power all five of its routes this way eventually while its coach fleet, used for longer distances, will continue to use waste cooking oil due to a lack of available technology. Can it be replicated? How easy will this idea be to replicate elsewhere? Chris Jardine, technical director of solar energy experts Joju Solar, says that in theory it should be easy. “I think the intricacies will be in whether you can get enough energy from the solar to fully power the fleet,” he says. “It may be easy in summer, while in the middle of winter you might be getting five times less electricity out of your solar panels. “By not putting it into the grid it makes it a bit more difficult as you come across this commonly found issue with renewables, that they’re intermittent,” says Will Cottrell, chairman of BEC. “You need to think quite hard about how it works technically,” he adds, explaining that getting the right size battery and overall system is key to providing the right level of supply. “But this is the way it’s got to be,” he says. “To move us away from a centralised energy system we need to move away from a centralised grid as well, so we need to understand the technology that is going to enable us to do that.” The plan for The Big Lemon is to produce enough energy in the winter, and an excess in summer but it will have a mains backup if needed. The team can then use any excess energy in the summer to give energy to the building. “I think our independence, background and philosophy generally makes it easier for us to try these things,” says Druitt. “That’s what all our stakeholders signed up for really, we don’t have an angry mob in an AGM.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"What will happen to oil and gas workers as the world turns carbon neutral?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"What will happen to oil and gas workers as the world turns carbon neutral?","bodyText":"Adriaan Kamp used to be a die-hard oilman. After 17 years at Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell, the 54-year-old Dutchman now runs a consultancy based in Oslo advising national governments on transitioning to cleaner energy. “In 2007 to 2008, we were looking at future energy scenarios in the Shell Group [and] there was a question on my desk about how do we play with renewables,” he says. “And from there, the journey started.” If the energy sector is to become carbon neutral by 2070, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change insists must happen to avoid a temperature rise of more than two degrees celsius, hundreds of thousands of workers will need to follow Kamp’s lead. The renewable sector in Europe alone could produce 6.1m new jobs by 2050, according to trade union Sustainlabour. By the same token, divestment in coal, oil and gas, and other carbon-intensive sectors could lead to a massive shake-up elsewhere in the global labour market. Industry skills In terms of skills, transitioning from old to new energy sectors should be comparatively straightforward. There’s “no magic” to renewable technologies, says Kamp. “Managing a wind farm or solar project is nothing a good oil and gas man who has built or organised facilities cannot manage,” he says. Sophie Bennett, policy officer for RenewableUK, agrees. Many of the technical and managerial needs of the low-carbon energy sector are similar to those in traditional energy and power industries, she says. But despite high demand for such expertise in the renewables sector, the transfer of skilled labour from fossil fuel sectors remains a trickle. If that’s to increase, governments need to make firm commitments and establish a long-term vision in support of energy transition, Bennett argues. “Policy uncertainty on renewables can hinder expenditure on skills by the industry. Plus, the skills interventions that are needed – such as apprenticeships and education outreach programmes – can require a long incubation period,” she says. The low-carbon sector itself is making small inroads with respect to the skills it needs. In the UK, for instance, the renewable training network provides training courses for technical, engineering and business roles. German engineering giant Siemens, meanwhile, offers a two-year training programme to equip graduates for work in the wind industry. Few equivalents can be found in fossil fuel industries. There’s a partial exception in the mining sector: mining firm Anglo American, headquartered in London, has a formal mine closure policy that includes employee reskilling and retraining. However, such re-employment schemes rarely direct workers specifically to the low-carbon energy sector. The UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) marks a rare attempt to do so. As part of a five-year retraining programme ahead of the anticipated decommissioning of two nuclear power stations in north Wales, workers were offered courses to obtain professional certificates valid in the renewable sector. Almost 9% of the 534 participating employees chose to do so. Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, managing director of Menter Môn Cyf, which administered the retraining on behalf of the NDA, believes all carbon-intensive industries should be obliged to offer employees retraining in line with government decarbonisation targets. “If it can be done in nuclear, then it should be done in the equally wealthy fossil fuel sector,” he says. Government responsibility Even in the event of such a system, many believe that governments need to take the lead, not industry. “It’s public authorities’ responsibility to create the policy and investment framework where energy transition will take place,” says Benjamin Denis, policy adviser on climate change at the European Trade Union Confederation. “Companies of course have a responsibility, but I don’t expect Shell or BP to take voluntary initiatives to pay attention to workers impacted by the transition.”Decarbonisation is an emotive issue for many labour unions. Earlier this year German trade unions threatened mass mobilisation in the wake of aggressive energy transition plans. Denis maintains that clean energies are not yet a “job killer”, but insists governments must provide training programmes to avoid them becoming so in the future. “We can’t decarbonise the economy, which is still massively fossil fuel-based, without changing the labour market. That’s why we are calling for a just transition,” he says. Examples of government-led integrated training strategies remain scant, however. Those that do exist, such as in Denmarkand Scotland, tend to be relatively small scale and locally targeted. A recent OECD study of green skills provision in Europe confirms that many governments’ green skills policies are “uncertain and fragmented”. Fuelling the current disarray is a lack of data on the types of jobs that employers in low-carbon industries will need in the future. The OECD advises governments to integrate green skills into mainstream education, rather than creating separate systems of training. It also recommends a focus on transferal skills rather than on occupation-specific training. As for financing such programmes, the European Commission says money is already there in existing green-growth funds. In its green employment initiative (pdf), released in 2014, it singles out pots such as the European social fund and the European development fund. In the US, meanwhile, training providers and industries can access a variety of federal government grants for green skills initiatives. Trade unions, however, argue that additional funds should also be found to support communities that will be especially hard-hit by a shift to cleaner energy – such as North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and Poland’s Silesia, which are both highly dependent on coal production. “In such regions, if you do not organise a strong social protection system, decarbonisation will have dramatic effects on the workforce and the communities,” says Denis, adding that such a system falls to local authorities, national governments and the EU to create jointly. Back in Oslo, former oilman Kamp welcomes any attempts governments can make to inspire people to pursue careers in clean energy sectors. “Creating an image of the renewable industry as an exciting career has to be a good thing,” he says. “But, at the end, there needs to be a job market that delivers it.” Sign up here for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

It is estimated that it will grow to 24m jobs worldwide by 2030 – up from 9.2m reported in 2014 – according to analysis by the International Renewable Energy Industry (Irena), which predicts that doubling the proportion of renewables in the global energy mix would increase GDP by up to $1.3tn across the world. The rise and rise of the solar industry has been the largest driver of growth. In 2014, it accounted for more than 2.5m jobs, largely in operations, maintenance and manufacturing – now increasingly dominated by a jobs boom in Asia. The industry is providing hope and income to workers – present and future – across the global south. Sheila Mbilishi, ‘solar-preneur’, Zambia Although employment in renewable energy is comparatively low across Africa, the sunny continent is where the need and potential for employment is perhaps greatest. A fast-growing economy and population is driving demand for energy, but two-thirds of people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity. Now the renewables revolution is witnessing the rise of a generation of African “solar-preneurs” who are creating small-scale businesses by taking solar energy – in the form of lights, radios and mobile-phone charging facilities – into local communities. In western Zambia, Sheila Mbilishi is self-employed and sells solar lights to local residents and businesses. The 67-year-old widow and mother of six buys the lights for $5 from the social enterprise SunnyMoney – part of the UK based charity SolarAid – and sells them on with a 50% profit margin. “They sell like cupcakes,” says Mbilishi. “There is life in the lights – people got interested in them.” They are popular with pupils who want to study after dark, businesses during electricity blackouts or as a replacement for toxic kerosene lamps in homes. Since starting the business three years ago, it has provided Mbilishi with a significant source of income, helping her to open a shop and build a two-bedroom flat. “The difference is huge,” she says. “Selling lights has helped me a lot. I have built a house out of the lights. Owning personal ones has helped me too with the current load shedding – electricity is usually off and I am not affected by no light.” Shehak Sattar, renewable energy student, Moscow For Shehak Sattar, choosing to study renewable energy was more a social than a personal decision. “I want to practise something different from the mainstream. It is related to the concept of believing in humanity and our survival on earth,” he says. The 27-year-old Pakistani student is now four months into a masters degree in the science and materials of solar energy at the National University of Science and Technology in Moscow, funded by a scholarship. The course is in its first year and has mostly attracted international students – from Afghanistan and Iran to Nigeria and Namibia. Before coming to Moscow, Sattar worked for NGOs and other agencies in Pakistan, installing and spreading the transmission of solar energy to remote communities and to slums in Islamabad and Lahore. Larger solar projects are now starting to come online in Pakistan, amid ambitions to construct the world’s largest solar farm. “There has been a general electricity crisis in Pakistan. People are waiting for alternatives to rescue them from this suffering,” he says. Once he has completed his course, Sattar wants to work at a university in Pakistan “to convert the attention of students to renewable energy sources” by lecturing and researching methods to make solar energy more efficient. “We have to fight more,” he says. “We have to fight against the people who will be digging for petroleum in the coming 20 years because it will destroy our ecology’s balance.” Mohamed Abdikadir, solar panel installer, Dadaab, Kenya The promise of renewable energy in refugee camps could save humanitarian agencies hundreds of millions of dollars and provide job opportunities for thousands of young refugees. Mohamed Abdikadir, 21, was born in the refugee camp complex at Dadaab in eastern Kenya, where the average family spends $17.20 per month – 24% of their income – on energy. The complex is home to more than 330,000 refugees. Like most of his neighbours, Abdikadir’s family came to the camp after fleeing the civil war in Somalia more than two decades ago. Both his parents have since died, leaving Abdikadir to provide for his 10 younger siblings. He is now one of 5,000 young people trained to install solar panels as part of a programme in Kenya and Ethiopia organised by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which has recruited local teachers to deliver it. “It was hard [to learn] at first but I tried my best and now it is easy,” says Abdikadir. After completing a six-month programme a year ago, he gets up at 5am every day to pray before preparing breakfast and collecting the tools for his job in Dadaab’s dry desert landscape. “There is a lot of sun here. Renewable energy is very good in this environment.” Before he started the programme, Abdikadir earned money by selling water but he could only make enough to provide one meal a day for his family. Now, with the extra income from solar installations – $10 on an average day – his siblings are eating three meals daily, have new clothing and are able to attend a fee-paying school. “I am the breadwinner of the family,” he says. “[The programme] has really helped me. Before I was idle. It helps with my daily bread, my daily income.” Abdikadir now wants to expand his education to incorporate other forms of renewable energy. Meanwhile, the NRC recently announced plans to deliver a similar programme on a larger scale for Syrians at Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.

As of the end of last year, Toyota has sold more than 2m Prius hybrids, more than half of a total of 3.5m hybrid cars of all models in the US alone. Together, they are taking a big bite out of gasoline consumption and emissions: hybrids use about 50% less gas and generate half as many emissions as traditional cars. But now we have a new problem: batteries. Those nickel-metal hydride (Nimh) batteries still need to be collected and recycled, or reused at the end of their useful lives in vehicles. Toyota now collects more than 90% of its batteries, and is aiming for 100% collected. But what happens to the batteries after they’re collected? Some are recycled, but from an environmental perspective, it’s even better if they are reused. In my work as chief environmental officer for Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America, I helped create a second life for some of these Prius batteries – in Yellowstone National Park. In May, Toyota and Yellowstone flipped the switch on a new energy system at the park’s Lamar Buffalo Ranch field campus, which combines solar power with energy storage built on 208 Nimh batteries from old Toyota Camry Hybrids. This project came about in an unexpected way. Although I’d been working with a number of partners to make sure Toyota collected every Nimh battery we sold, our intent was to recycle those batteries rather than repurpose them. But while I was visiting a Nascar Green event in Chicago, I heard that Yellowstone National Park was using a gas-powered generator and lead-acid battery system to power its off-the-grid Lamar Buffalo Ranch center – a decidedly unsustainable energy system for an environmental education center. Because I’d worked with Yellowstone many times over the years to provide philanthropic contributions of Toyota vehicles to support park operations, I saw this as an opportunity to do the right thing for Yellowstone while also charting a path forward for Toyota’s operations. Energy was already a clear challenge for Toyota – you can’t be in manufacturing and not deal with rising energy costs. So I approached one of our energy experts to discuss if energy storage using old hybrid batteries was even feasible. “Technically, yes,” was the response. But plenty of complications remained. First and foremost, we had to decide what was most important for Toyota to learn from this venture. As an engineer by training, I wanted to know everything about everything – a great mindset if you’re working in the lab, but far too complicated in the field. So I sat down with my team to get a better idea of what we can do now, what it will take to get the system up and running, and what we needed to eliminate and revisit down the line. That was perhaps the hardest part of this project, and it’s true of almost any project: I tried to solve everything from the start. That caused problems right away – sometimes you simply can’t do everything. Eventually, I realized that cutting back my ambitions for the project was a blessing in disguise. Not only did streamlining the focus of the project help us move a lot faster, but it also put us in the long term mindset. Maybe I wasn’t going to be able to create a viable energy storage product for Toyota right out of the gate, but committing to evaluate and improve this system over time gave it a better chance of survival. An example of this is the process we followed to source our microinverters, the critically important components that convert the electricity generated by the solar panels to a form that can be stored in the batteries. As I discussed our needs with various potential partners, I kept our long term commitment in mind, knowing that we would not only need something custom-built for this project, but that it had to be something that could evolve and scale with us. In the end, we chose our partners for this project with an eye on not only the quality of their products, but also their willingness to take the long ride with us. As we continue our energy storage work, what I’ve learned has helped us smooth the path ahead – and it can help others who are starting down the path of research and development-led innovation. I’d boil it down to this: aim high, but start small, and keep your eyes on the long-term prize."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"news/2016/dec/26/this-is-possible-we-did-it-the-week-portugal-ran-on-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-26T08:00:37Z","webTitle":"'This is possible.

We did it': the week Portugal ran on renewables","bodyText":"If you can keep your gaze off the hilltops, imagine away the pylons and forget the occasional tractor of an uncertain vintage coughing along the narrow roads, little appears to have changed in the valleys of north-eastern Portugal for decades, perhaps even centuries. The gnarled alvarinho vines have been relieved of their fruit to make vinho verde, an old woman in black herds her sheep through a hamlet and hungry eagles hover over the fields, scanning the land for lunch. But look up, past the villages, the clumps of stout ponies and the wolf-haunted forests of pine, oak and eucalyptus, and the harbingers of an environmental revolution are silhouetted against the December sky. The 130 giant wind turbines that sprout from the peaks, slicing the air with a rhythmic sigh, have helped Portugal to a remarkable achievement. For four and a half days in May the country ran entirely on electricity from renewable sources: wind, hydro and solar power. Despite fears of a blackout, the lights stayed on for a record 107 hours between 6.45am on Saturday 7 May and 5.45pm the following Wednesday. Francisco Ferreira, president of the Portuguese environmental NGO Zero, got wind of what was going on when a friend called that weekend. “He said: ‘I’ve been looking at the graphs and for the past two days we’ve been 100% renewable on electricity production.’ After that, we looked at the data and arrived at 107 hours. We confirmed it with the national energy network, who said we’d had 4.5 days. “It was great to see that the system was working; to see that we could manage all these renewables even though the circumstances were quite challenging.” Ferreira and his fellow clean energy advocates hold up those few days as further proof that renewables can reliably replace fossil fuels. Things may have been helped along by the fact that a good chunk of the 107 hours fell over the weekend – when demand is lower – and by an unusually co-operative Mother Nature, who saw to it that the sun shone and the wind blew favourably. But supporters of renewable power insist it was down to much more than luck. António Sá da Costa, managing director of the Portuguese renewable energy association Apren, argues it was the result of years of investment and cooperation. “It was the coming together of three factors, without which none if it would have been possible,” he says. “The first was that we had the power plants in place to take advantage of the natural conditions during that period; second, it was only possible because of the wind, water and sun. The third was that we had the operational grid capability – in terms of both distribution and transportation – to manage this type of situation.” Yes, the timing was lucky, he adds. But that does not lessen the achievement of linking up hundreds of dispersed renewable power plants instead of taking the easier option of relying on production from one large thermal one. Or, to put it a little more pithily: “When Cristiano Ronaldo scores a goal, people say it was lucky. No. It wasn’t lucky. It was a lot of training, a lot of preparation and a lot of things. In our case it wasn’t just luck.” Sá da Costa traces Portugal’s interest in renewable energy back to 1970, when almost all the electricity consumed in the country was from renewable hydropower plants. However, as the country developed economically, demand outstripped supply, forcing it to look to more conventional sources. It wasn’t until the end of the last century when windfarms appeared in Madeira and, later, on the mainland, that people started to take renewables more seriously. Although Portugal has been a frontrunner on clean energy for more than a decade – Altos Minhos was Europe’s largest onshore windfarm when it opened eight years ago – the country’s weather and geography have yet to be fully harnessed. Portugal’s climate varies between wet and dry years. In wet years, hydropower is the main source of energy, followed by wind and coal. In dry years, however, coal is first, followed by wind and hydro. According to Apren’s figures, renewable energy has been responsible for 59% of national energy production during a wet 2016, with 41% from fossil fuels. Hydro power has yielded 32%, wind 25%, and solar close to 2%. Efforts to increase the renewable sector have been hit by Portugal’s economic crisis, which has spooked would-be investors and slowed growth. Sá de Costa and Ferreira both say the country has to do far more to exploit its thousands of annual hours of sunshine through the creation of more solar farms. “That’s the real push we need for the future,” says Ferreira. “In the winter, between November and June, hydro and wind can probably guarantee [things]. But from May or June to October and November, we could rely less on wind, and much less on hydro.” Despite the slowdown, Sá de Costa is bullish about Portugal’s capacity to comfortably meet and exceed EU targets for member states to have at least a 27% share of renewable energy consumption by 2030. With sufficient investment and construction – more windfarms and many more solar farms – he believes that Portugal could be on course to generate 60% of its energy through renewables by 2020 and 100% by 2040. Jorge Seguro Sanches, Portugal’s energy secretary, says the country is on track to see renewable energy accounting for 31% of its energy use by 2020. He also says the government is heavily promoting a solar power programme as part of its plans to reduce dependence on oil imports and foster the development of a sustainable technology hub. “In the past few years, we have seen a prosperous boom in windfarms,” he says. “Nevertheless, the market nowadays is oriented towards photovoltaic solar energy, as a result of its high technological development and the decline of investment costs. This is a new path for the near future, [and] will guarantee the sustainability of the Portuguese electricity system.” In the misty valleys of Alto Minho, the windfarm is gradually becoming part of the landscape. Long-horned barrosã cattle graze among the 80-metre-high turbines and seek out their shade in summer. Hunters in pursuit of boar, rabbits and birds still crisscross the hillsides but keep a respectful distance from the technicians who service the plant. Sometimes, the odd wolf is glimpsed far below the sweeping blades. For Sá da Costa, who has something of the glee of a prophet seeing his predictions coming true, those four and a half days in May were the best possible riposte to the naysayers. “Now no one can come along and say in good conscience that this is impossible. No. This is possible. Because we did it. And if we did it, it’s also possible in other countries. It’s just a question of finding how to do it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-28T16:00:04Z","webTitle":"Energy sector faces struggle to find the female engineers of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","fields":{"headline":"Energy sector faces struggle to find the female engineers of the future","bodyText":"While the lack of female chief executives in the UK is a problem, the lack of female engineers is an even bigger concern, as Dorothy Thompson, chief executive of Drax group, knows only too well. The head of the UK’s largest power station is grappling with the question of how to attract more women into the energy sector. Thompson says the six places available on the Drax apprenticeship scheme this year attracted just two female applicants compared with 76 men. The education is partly to blame, she says, but energy companies also need to do much more to change girls’ perceptions. Thompson has overseen Drax’s conversion of its coal-fired boilers to biomass to secure the future of the plant near Selby in North Yorkshire as environmental rules bite. She is one of a tiny pool of women running big UK companies, and an even smaller number at the top of the energy industry. The proportion of women on the boards of energy companies was 9% in 2014, and exactly the same two years later. The gender imbalance is not much better further down the management chain. “We would like to have more female apprentices, more female engineers. We believe in diversity,” she says. “But it is challenging. In our current [recruitment] process, there’s a real paucity of female candidates. We struggle to get sufficient candidates to increase the percentage [of women].” She says that while schools should do more to encourage girls to study science and subjects that could equip them for a career in energy, much of the responsibility in addressing the imbalance lies with the industry. “Part of it is in education but part of it is perception. We as an industry need to be more proactive in explaining how interesting an opportunity we are [to young women],” she says. Thompson is far from alone in recognising the imbalance or trying to do something about it. “This is a huge cultural issue for the industry,” says Joan MacNaughton, who is on the board of Powerful Women, a group helping females advance their career in the sector. “There are expectations of women that I don’t think are 21st century. It’s a very, very male culture.” MacNaughton, who spent five years at French company Alstom’s energy division and sits on the board of Energy Academy Europe, says even energy companies that like to think of themselves as progressive have a problem. “They’re not Jeremy Clarkson [the men]; they’re cultured, well-mannered people. But the assumption in senior circles is that you can all have a conversation about your yachts. As a woman there who doesn’t have a yacht, you just have to walk away.” EDF, which is building Britain’s first new nuclear power station in two decades, has been running a cinema ad campaign as part of its drive to encourage girls and young women to study disciplines that could lead to energy jobs. “To recruit the numbers needed to fulfil demand for the future, we need more girls to study science subjects at school, further education and higher education,” says the French company’s boss, Vincent de Rivaz, in a foreword to a recent EDF jobs report. Dr Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers agrees: “Often women don’t see heavy industry as a likely future career. Maybe it’s because of the way we talk about engineering and the way it’s shown on TV and talked about in schools.” The root of the problem is not just in education but society more widely, she adds. “When you’re a teenager you want to fit in, and society doesn’t say to girls, ‘yay, go out and build power plants’.” Sara Bell, founder of technology company Tempus Energy, says while it is still vital to encourage girls to study Stem subjects – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – the industry has to look at how it presents itself. “I used to work in financial markets, which is a pretty testosterone-fuelled environment. The energy sector makes finance look like an equal opportunities employer,” she says. “A lot of 15-year-old girls will look at the role models – middle-aged men, predominantly white – and not see anything they can relate to.” Drax’s Thompson agrees that the lack of role models is an issue. “It is unfortunate that there are not more senior women in energy, because it would make it appear more accessible to women. I think it’s unfortunate because the industry is in fact perfectly accessible.” Alice Gill should know. As a schoolgirl she was taken on a tour of the power station and now, at 22, after taking biology, maths, chemistry and physics A-levels, she has just completed a four-year apprenticeship scheme with Drax. “A lot of women are, like, girly girls, aren’t they?” she says. “I can’t imagine them coming in in overalls with no makeup on, and getting their hands dirty. It’s not necessarily a problem with the industry [the lack of women]; I think the problem is that people just aren’t interested.” The solution, she thinks, is to expose more women to the sector at young age: “Just educate more people about it.” Other remedies proposed for addressing the energy industry’s gender imbalance include better transparency on promotions inside companies, and much closer scrutiny of hiring practices. “Everyone should have to monitor the [gender] figures, the intake and promotion figures into middle management, and from middle management into board,” says MacNaughton. “When you get the transparency, then people start to see the problem and fix it. There will never be a single bullet for such a complex problem.” The Drax dilemma Dorothy Thompson’s 12-year reign at Drax has seen her dramatically transform what it does and where it’s going. She foresaw the end of coal in the UK long before ministers announced in 2015 their plan to phase out all coal power by 2025. Three of Drax’s coal-fired generators have been converted to burn wood pellets, mostly from North American forests. But the company suffered a setback in 2014 when the government ruled that a fourth unit would not be eligible for subsidies, and another in 2015, when the Treasury ended its carbon tax exemption. Drax is lobbying for a rethink, arguing that the UK needs stable low-carbon power to complement increasing amounts of wind and solar energy, but the prospect of a further subsidy is unlikely. The company signalled a new strategy last year with its acquisition of business energy supplier Opus Energy and four gas power stations, and is also looking to buy more wood pellet plants in the US. “It’s all about diversifying our earnings, strengthening their stability, and using our areas of expertise and our commercial position to make us stronger and more sustainable - in every sense of the word,” Thompson told the Observer. But some analysts are sceptical of how profitable this will be. “Drax’s acquisition of Opus Energy heralded the start of a new strategy focusing on securing earnings beyond 2027,” investment bank Jefferies said in a recent note. “We feel optimism regarding the new strategy is overdone and we continue to believe that long-term power prices will remain low.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-13T14:41:34Z","webTitle":"Why do rich countries think development should be only one way?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals","fields":{"headline":"Why do rich countries think development should be only one way?","bodyText":"In my 20 or so years working with the development sector I’ve long been extremely uncomfortable with the idea that we in the “north” know better than those in the “south”. We certainly have more material resources, and so more power and opportunities than many, but development as something rich people do to poor people doesn’t gel well with me. Nowadays, many people working in development would agree with this view. And yet we still send our workers to developing countries to “build capacity”; we send young volunteers there to help out in their gap year; and we constantly lecture poorer countries about the vagaries of everything from corruption to inequality. Ahem … glass houses? So I’ve concluded that the next generation of “development” should turn this equation on its head. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were lauded, in part, because they were universal: yes, Sierra Leone or Vietnam has to adopt them but so, too, does the UK. We may be able to offer financial resources to the south, but the south has a considerable store of knowledge to offer us, too. “Reverse development” is what we need, and we should set up a northern based agency staffed by southerners to help build our own capacity to meet the SDGs. Some examples come to mind. Gender equality (goal five) Nicaragua, Rwanda and Ecuador all rank higher than the UK in the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap. Fewer than a third of our MPs are women, ranking us 49th in the world in terms of the number of women in national parliaments. Many developing countries are doing far better. What can we learn from them? How did they achieve it? What systems do we need to put in place? Affordable and clean energy (goal seven) Micro grid and off grid, affordable solar energy is taking off in the developing world. Rather than waiting for mega projects many, such as Mera Gao Power in Uttar Pradesh, India, or Karibu solar in Tanzania, are showing how it’s done. Where are our energy social entrepreneurs? We have a swath of community energy projects, but large Hinkley-style money pits still dominate our energy landscape. Can we learn from the southern social entrepreneurs and just get on with it? Can they build our capacity to innovate? Sustainable consumption (goal 12) Several development economists, from Amartya Sen to Manfred Max Neef, have looked at the role of wellbeing and poverty, and considered wellbeing to be the ultimate aim, rather than macro-level economic growth, jobs, or even income. People in developing countries can help us gain a much better understanding of how to live the good life, while consuming less. Clearly, the poor don’t have enough material needs or security to have high levels of wellbeing. But having a higher income and consuming more isn’t necessarily a recipe to success either. Rather than exporting our overladen consumer culture to the south, we should be learning from and listening to those whose lives are reported as having high levels of satisfaction, yet who consume fewer material resources. Peace, justice and strong institutions (goal 16) Western criminal justice systems are almost entirely based on punishment for bad behaviour. In many African countries, and indigenous communities through the world, customary law focuses more on reconciliation and social responsibility. Especially for low-risk offenders, it has been shown to be more effective in reducing repeat offences. Rather than building more prisons, can we bring expertise from these communities to help us build the skills and capacity we need to introduce successful restorative justice programmes here at home? Partnerships for sustainable development (goal 17) If Brexit and the rise of Trump tell us anything, it’s that people feel disenfranchised and want more, rather than less, control over decisions that affect them directly. Brazil provides one of the best case studies, where dozens of communities are engaged in democratic processes over local public investment priorities, under the guise of “participatory budgeting”. Research from Brazil shows that this leads to increases in public spending on social programmes, from health and education to water and sanitation. In India, similar results were found across communities in the southern state of Kerala, where participatory budgeting led to significant improvements in roads, housing and child services. Why aren’t we doing more of this in the developed world? Other examples come to mind – the digital economy is adapting far more rapidly in some parts of the south, such as India, than in the north. Care of older people, meanwhile, also has elements we need to adopt more of in the north, such as how to look after extended families in the home. Development is no longer a one-way street. “Reverse development” may be as important for the next 60 years, as north-south development has been for the past 60.

Experts speaking at the Australian Solar Energy Exhibition and Conference in Melbourne last week said the technology had been proven in other countries, and projects in Australia were viable, but the challenge was getting major investors to gamble on something new. James Fisher, the chief technology officer of Australian solar energy company Vast Solar, said solar thermal energy had been the “poor cousin” to photovoltaic solar panels for some years, but that may finally be changing. “We’ve got a whole lot of coal-fired power stations that largely are 30-plus years old and many of them are going to retire naturally,” he said. “[Concentrated solar power] CSP is basically a complete coal-fired power replacement. “We can act as base-load [power], we can run 24/7 if that is what is needed and we have all the benefits that a coal plant offers to the grid.” The theory behind large-scale solar thermal is relatively simple, even if building it is not. Curved mirrors called heliostats are positioned in a field, reflecting the sun’s energy onto a tower with a receiver on top. A liquid material, such as molten salt, is pumped through the receiver where it is heated and then pumped back down to be stored in a tank. When electricity is required, the hot material is used to heat water, creating steam and turning a turbine. Vast Solar has a solar thermal plant in Jemalong, near Forbes, 370km west of Sydney and will complete a 6MW pilot plant at nearby Jemalong within the next few months. It will then move forward with a 30MW plant on the site, which would be a commercial-scale plant and, hopefully, a proving ground for Vast Solar’s technology. “Obviously you want to build big and in the CSP industry you get a lot of bang for your buck as you increase the size of your turbine,” Mr Fisher said. “Ideally, you’d be building at that 250MW scale, but we can go down as little as 30MW and make it work [commercially].” Vast Solar’s Jemalong project uses several 27-metre towers, each with a receiver in front of hundreds of heliostats. Every model is different and Vast Solar pumps liquid sodium into its receivers, where it is heated to about 600C, before it is pumped back down and the heat transferred to molten salt for storage. The company has raised $25m for the project so far, enough to proceed with the 30MW station. Another, much bigger solar thermal project in the spotlight was a proposed 110MW plant to be built at Port Augusta in South Australia by US renewable energy company SolarReserve. SolarReserve already has runs on the board, after completing an operational 110MW plant in Nevada in the United States last year. Daniel Thompson, the director of development, said that success in Nevada, along with projects under way in other countries, could be replicated in Port Augusta. “This is very much a blueprint from our previous projects, so it is largely de-risked and we’re very, very comfortable with what we can deliver there,” he said. That confidence is obviously shared by the world’s biggest coal producer, Chinese company Shenhua Coal, which signed a memorandum of understanding with SolarReserve last week to build ten, large-scale solar tower and storage plants in China, totalling more than 1,000MW and at a cost of $2bn. The proposed plant in Port Augusta, to be called Aurora, would be located 30km north of town. Unlike the Vast Solar Project, SolarReserve’s plan uses one large tower with a receiver at the top, surrounded by thousands of heliostats. Like all large-scale solar thermal plants, Aurora’s true value lies in its energy storage – 880MW hours, enough to last about eight hours, so that it can keep generating electricity at night, when solar panels have stopped producing. SolarReserve uses molten salt through the entire process, pumping it through the receiver and into the storage tanks at about 565C. Mr Thompson said construction of the plant in Nevada had created 4,500 jobs in the construction phase, and 45 permanent jobs once the plant was operational. Those numbers will be similar at the Port Augusta plant. He said investors were enthusiastic about the project in Port Augusta, but they needed to see certain fundamentals fall into place before committing. “We have already been to the debt and equity markets and had an overwhelming response from them and we are oversubscribed on both, which is great,” he said. “It’s early stages and they’ve obviously got to look at the project more deeply to finalise their position on that, but early indications are there is plenty of money around for this technology.” While SolarReserve and Vast Solar were both bullish about the future of their Australian projects, neither shied away from the reality that investors still have a ‘wait and see’ approach to large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia. “Right now, when it’s a first-off plant, [attracting investors] is a difficult thing, so you need an investor with a high-risk appetite,” James Fisher said. “That really means it’s going to need government support. “Once you’ve got the first plant built, then it comes to a different sort of [investor] and there is huge amounts of money out there looking for infrastructure investments that are giving a return over a 30-year plant life. “There is no shortage of funds once you prove the technology,” he said."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/political-science/2016/jul/23/after-brexit-breaking-down-barriers-in-science-is-more-necessary-than-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-23T08:00:35Z","webTitle":"After Brexit, breaking down barriers in science is more necessary than ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/jul/23/after-brexit-breaking-down-barriers-in-science-is-more-necessary-than-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2016/jul/23/after-brexit-breaking-down-barriers-in-science-is-more-necessary-than-ever","fields":{"headline":"After Brexit, breaking down barriers in science is more necessary than ever","bodyText":"Next week, the European science community will meet at the biannual EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Manchester. This will be the first ESOF to be held in the UK, and the first in the context of a post-referendum Britain. With the uncertainty that Brexit has created both in Britain and Europe more generally, and for UK science in particular, there has never been a more important time for the European science community to commit to overcoming barriers. Few in the world of science would quibble over the assertion that British science has benefited enormously from EU membership and vice versa. European initiatives have helped create working relationships that transcend boundaries whilst the UK science base has benefited tremendously from the free movement of scientists and innovators across national and organisational boundaries. More generally, recent European history is defined by the breaking down of barriers, not least the knocking down of a wall that, for decades, divided a nation. At midnight on 9 November 1989, concrete and steel shattered and bent as segments of the Berlin Wall parted. This opened access to both sides of the city for the first time in nearly 30 years. The fall of the wall was the first step for Germany, towards reunification and new frontiers and boundaries on social, economic, architectural, and infrastructural levels. Cut to almost twenty years later, and Europe is a changed place with a vibrant science base that has been fostered through collaboration and cross-working on a number of levels, which includes the role carried out by forums such as the Falling Walls Lab, which works to promote international collaboration and cross-disciplinary exchange. Our annual event encourages under-graduate and post-graduate innovators from all disciplines to present to us their ideas on which is the next wall to fall, and how they propose to help it fall. Previous entries having included breaking the ‘walls’ of gross income inequality to producing cleaner solar energy, and from combatting cardiovascular disease to introducing living robots. As a world-wide event with national heats, and through encouraging entries from all academic disciplines, our work provides a platform for ideas that transcends boundaries, breaking down a barrier in itself. We are conscious, however, that there is still a long way to go in truly overcoming the barriers to cross-boundary working. This covers a wide range of issues including funding availability and access, a lack of awareness of the benefits this type of working can bring, resourcing facilitators, and general logistics. Taking into account recent political developments, a focus on building and maintaining bridges to keep the scientific community of Europe and the world connected and active has never been more important. That’s why we’re committed to supporting the sector in the UK by providing a platform for scientists to connect within Europe and the rest of the world. What’s certain is that, in order to break down the barriers that still exist and ensure that new ones aren’t created or re-built, it will be essential to continue to promote an open dialogue within the European scientific community. What we have at our disposal are some of the greatest minds from across the world with a vested interest in making sure that this happens. Naveed Syed is Project Manager for Falling Walls Lab. Falling Walls Lab Manchester is being hosted by the Manchester Enterprise Centre at Alliance Manchester Business School (University of Manchester) as part of ESOF 2016 on 27 July.

The snowy surface of Greenland started becoming significantly less reflective of solar radiation from around 1996, the analysis found, with the ice absorbing 2% more solar energy per decade from this point. At the same time, summer near-surface temperatures in Greenland have increased at a rate of around 0.74C per decade, causing the ice to melt. This winnowing away of the ice, exacerbated by soot blown on to the ice from wildfires, means that Greenland’s ice is stuck in what is known as a “feedback loop” that will make it ever more vulnerable to warming global temperatures. The study predicts that the ice surface reflectivity, or albedo, will drop by 10% or more by the end of the century, which will trigger further melting. “It’s melting cannibalism, basically – it’s melting that’s feeding itself,” said lead author Marco Tedesco, of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “Rising temperatures are promoting more melting, and that melting is reducing albedo, which in turn is increasing melting. “It’s worrying because if the ice sheet continues to get darker, it becomes more sensitive to atmospheric warming. The impact of two weeks of sunshine with no clouds, for example, is far greater than it was 20 years ago. The ice is going to melt much more quickly, with more water flowing off on to the sea.” In recent years, scientists have began to pick apart the complex, interrelated forces at play in the Arctic, which has experienced a 13.4% drop in minimum ice extent per decade, on average, since the 1980s. More than half of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melting last summer, the largest annual melt since 2012 and well beyond the average melting seen over the past 35 years. Tedesco’s research shows that as the surface of Greenland’s ice melts, old impurities, such as dust from erosion or soot that has been entombed for years, start to appear, darkening the surface. If the summer is warm enough to remove all the snow, these dark impurities begin to spread across the surface, providing a far more heat-absorbent environment. At the same time, as this snow melts and then refreezes, the grains of snow get larger. These larger grains, invisible to the eye but detected by satellite’s infrared instruments, also create a less reflective surface. These two processes are turning Greenland into a store, rather than a reflector, of solar energy, with consequences far beyond the icy wilderness. Water from the melting flows into the sea, contributing to rising oceans around the world. This process is unlikely to reverse given the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “As warming continues, the feedback from declining albedo will add up,” Tedesco said. “It’s a train running downhill, and the hill is getting steeper.” The research, published in the European Geosciences Union journal The Cryosphere, looked at satellite data from 1981 to 2012. The drop in reflectivity from 1996 was probably due to a change in atmospheric circulation that favoured warmer, moist air from the south. The scientists found there was no significant increase in soot from forest fires since 1997 to explain the darkening of the surface. This article was amended on 3 March 2016. An earlier version referred to the European Geophysical Union, instead of the European Geosciences Union. This article was amended on 4 March 2016 to clarify a statement that more than half of the Greenland ice sheet melted away last year. More than 50% of the ice sheet experienced some melting, but didn’t melt away completely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/10/solar-energy-cells-you-can-print-out-catching-commercial-eye-says-csiro","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-10T06:39:41Z","webTitle":"Solar energy cells you can print out catching commercial eye, says CSIRO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/solar-energy-cells-you-can-print-out-catching-commercial-eye-says-csiro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/10/solar-energy-cells-you-can-print-out-catching-commercial-eye-says-csiro","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy cells you can print out catching commercial eye, says CSIRO","bodyText":"Renewable energy generation that allows flexible solar power cells to be printed off and attached to places such as windows and smartphones is close to commercialisation, the CSIRO has said. Work on printed solar cells has been under way since 2007 through the Victorian Organic Solar Cell Consortium, which includes CSIRO, and Melbourne and Monash universities. A printer at the CSIRO office in Clayton, Victoria, has been able to make prototypes of the solar cells in order to improve their efficiency. The technology consists of a type of “solar ink” which is designed to capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. A fine layer of this ink is then deposited onto a material, such as plastic. This allows for cells to be embedded into windows, effectively tinting them, to generate electricity. They can be printed in smaller sizes to be used to charge devices such as smartphones and laptops. The CSIRO has had the solar cells on its Clayton roof for the past 18 months, with decent results. The printed cells are 10 times less efficient than standard solar panels, which are made of silicon, but scientists hope to improve that. Fiona Scholes, the group leader of integrated systems and devices at CSIRO’s manufacturing flagship, said several companies, such as Dyesol, had expressed interest in helping commercialise the technology. “We can’t manufacture them here, but we are at the point where they can be taken up by a manufacturer,” she told Guardian Australia. “It would be wonderful if we could achieve a similar power delivery at significantly reduced cost. Silicon is falling in price, but think about how cheap plastic is. The ink is a negligible cost, so the raw materials are very cost effective. “This is a big step forward because you can put these cells anywhere you can think of. Also the consistency is better than silicon – they work well in cloudy conditions.” Funding for the project has been provided by the Victorian government and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). The federal government is attempting to abolish Arena. “Whenever I tell people about this technology, the response is so positive,” said Scholes. “People love the idea. I think there would be a good demand for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2016/nov/06/katharine-hayhoe-climate-scientist-evangelical-christian","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-06T13:00:16Z","webTitle":"Texas scientist and evangelical takes to the web to convert climate cynics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/06/katharine-hayhoe-climate-scientist-evangelical-christian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2016/nov/06/katharine-hayhoe-climate-scientist-evangelical-christian","fields":{"headline":"Texas scientist and evangelical takes to the web to convert climate cynics","bodyText":"“Speaking of shills, if she teaches in Texas she probably gets grants from the oil industry.” This is one of the more polite social media missiles Katharine Hayhoe has had fired at her this week. But it’s hopelessly misguided. Hayhoe is a climate scientist. And she’s on a mission to persuade skeptics that humans are frying the planet and time is running out to stop it. The last people she would take money from is Big Oil. While most US climate scientists live amid constant controversy, Hayhoe believes she is enduring an acute level of abuse because she reaches parts of the population many of her peers cannot reach. She’s an evangelical Christian. Her husband is an evangelical pastor, even, in a faith whose followers are largely skeptical of climate science. But stating the obvious doesn’t stop the hate mail. It’s stepped up a notch since the academic launched a new web series in recent weeks, Global Weirding – a twist on the term global warming – to explain to doubters why climate change is causing ever more peculiar, dangerous weather and it’s our fault. “Oh, I’ve been called the C-word, I’ve been called an ‘eff-wit’, some really disgusting stuff. Most of it is just hateful, hateful language, a lot of it anonymous – and when it’s not nameless, 99% of the time it’s from a white man. Facebook and Twitter’s systems for reporting abuse are garbage, by the way,” she said. Hayhoe is the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where she teaches and conducts research as an atmospheric scientist and an associate professor of political science. As a Texas-dwelling, evangelical Christian, atmospheric scientist, Hayhoe can often win the ears of many religious communities, receive invitations to address students at Christian colleges, or have conversations with mega-church-going Republican climate cynics she otherwise mightn’t meet or who wouldn’t listen. Her faith and, now, her web series, has led many people to tell her they had believed or suspected that human-influenced climate change was a liberal hoax but that she has changed their minds, she said. But Global Weirding has also brought increased hate mail. “I did have, a few years ago, a death threat, which I reported to the police,” she said. Now new floods of insults are pouring in since she launched the web series last month. She’s coping partly by seeing it as a “sort of encouraging, in a strange way” sign that she’s hitting new audiences, drawing contrarians and environmental converts alike. Hayhoe has made Global Weirding in conjunction with her local PBS TV station, KTTZ, and it’s released via YouTube. The short installments are released every other Wednesday, with the fourth one of the inaugural season due the day after the 8 November presidential election. The series delivers a carefully calibrated, humorous, light-hearted lecture underpinned with serious science, featuring cartoons and Hayhoe talking on screen. The first episode sought to “bust the myth” of stereotypical “green liberals” having a monopoly on environmentalism. The second explained the history of climate science and why global warming isn’t a blip, a natural cycle or a leftwing conspiracy. And the third pointed out that while Texas emits more carbon than Germany, it’s also the US’s leading producer of wind energy and “has the potential to lead the nation in solar energy”. Forthcoming episodes explore themes such as “it’s not just polar bears”, “what happened in Paris?” and “religion in relation to climate change”. Evangelical Christians in the US are split on whether climate change is real and whether it’s mankind’s fault. The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) supports the science but that body only represents a portion of the born-again faithful in America. “We have to draw a very clear line between US evangelicals and those in the rest of the world,” said Hayhoe. “I went to the Paris climate talks last December and the head of the World Evangelical Alliance, Efraim Tendero, was an official delegate. It doesn’t get more serious than that,” she said, referring to the talks that led to a historic deal in which, after years of conflict, almost 200 countries, including the US, signed an agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. That deal came into force on Friday after the US, China and the European Union agreed to ratify it in recent weeks. “In the US, the NAE supports the science but evangelicals are not a coherent denomination here. It’s extremely fragmented, there are no bishops or hierarchy, most churches have one overworked pastor and there’s a leadership vacuum on climate that’s being filled by conservative politicians and media,” Hayhoe said. She added that while evangelicals in other countries typically believe humans are changing the climate, only about 30 or 40% of US evangelicals agree. However, she said the skepticism is more linked to conservatism than religion per se. When Hayhoe encounters those insisting that what happens in the world is controlled by God, she explains the climate science – but can also reference the Bible. She quotes the book of Genesis to illustrate that “God gave us the planet and says we are responsible for it” and then Revelation, warning: “God will destroy those who destroy the Earth.” Hayhoe is Canadian, so won’t be voting on Tuesday. But she’s dismayed that “the US is the only country in the entire world where one major political party [the GOP] explicitly denies the reality of climate change,” she said. Based on what the rivals for the White House have said on the campaign trail, if Hillary Clinton wins on Tuesday Hayhoe will be “cautiously hopeful” about action to slow global warming. How will she feel if Donald Trump wins? “Alarmed,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/04/florida-solar-power-amendment-1-vote-al-gore-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-04T19:27:03Z","webTitle":"Florida measure calls itself pro-solar but critics say it's 'a wolf in sheep's clothing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/04/florida-solar-power-amendment-1-vote-al-gore-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/04/florida-solar-power-amendment-1-vote-al-gore-criticism","fields":{"headline":"Florida measure calls itself pro-solar but critics say it's 'a wolf in sheep's clothing'","bodyText":"Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state. The measure, known as amendment 1, has been criticized as “fundamentally dishonest” for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America’s sunshine state. The amendment would change Florida’s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also states that the government should “ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do”. A group called Consumers for Smart Solar, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida’s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering. “The utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,” said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. “It has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.” Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already “stunted” in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels. The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state. Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of “trying to fool you” into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and an attempt to “constitutionalize the status quo”. Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support has recently plummeted to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass. The drop in support followed the Miami Herald’s release in October of an audio recording by Sal Nuzzo, vice-president of free market group James Madison Institute. Nuzzo told an industry conference that amendment 1 was an “incredibly savvy maneuver” and “political jiujitsu” that would “completely negate anything (pro-solar groups) would try to do legislatively or constitutionally down the road”. Consumers for Smart Solar, the utilities-backed group, has denied any connection to the Hames Madison Institute and insisted that the amendment would protect consumers from scams and from subsidizing solar companies from outside Florida. “Amendment 1 is good for the environment, it is good for consumers and it is good for Florida,” said Dick Batchelor, co-chair of Consumers for Smart Solar. “However, in looking at ways to increase the amount of our energy that comes from the sun, it is essential that we do so in a way that safeguards consumers – particularly our seniors – with commonsense consumer protection rules that benefit every consumer, and that we have all come to expect.” The Florida solar measure isn’t the only climate-related item voters will decide on on Tuesday. Voters in Washington will decide whether the state will be the first in the US to introduce a carbon tax on emissions. The measure, called I-732, would place a $25-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100. It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington’s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households. The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn’t support I-732 because it “does not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy”, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income. The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state’s revenue by $200m a year. However, the measure does retain some notable support, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama. An open letter penned by 51 climate scientists also backs I-732. “This revenue neutral measure offers the most progressive change in our tax code in decades and represents a bipartisan effort that rejects ideology,” the letter states. “While many interrelated social and environmental needs demand our attention, complex problems are best solved one step at a time. I-732 is a simple step in the right direction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/sustainable-solar-power-innovation-off-the-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-21T12:16:00Z","webTitle":"Solar energy technology for those with no access to electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-solar-power-innovation-off-the-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-solar-power-innovation-off-the-grid","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy technology for those with no access to electricity","bodyText":"Around the world approximately 1.7 billion people still live off the grid, with no access to mains electricity. This comes with numerous problems, with lighting and access to income among the most pressing. Once the sun goes does down those off the grid are reliant on kerosene, which is not only hazardous but expensive. While mobile phone use is widespread off the grid, recharging can be a difficult process requiring a long journey, and the lack of charge can mean restricted access to business opportunities or basic services. Solar power could have a major role in solving these problems and others, with a number of new products aimed at improving conditions and opportunities for those in off the grid, base of the pyramid markets. Some are being directly marketed to developing nations, while some have applications with the potential to make a difference worldwide. A number of these companies owe their success to crowdfunding campaigns, highlighting the role that the general public have to play in ensuring that such projects, with sustainability applications for both developing and developed nations, get further than the planning stages. Here are five examples of solar power innovations aiming to make a difference to those living off the grid. Waka Waka The Waka Waka solar light is the brainchild of Dutch product developer, Camille van Gestel. A successful crowdfunding campaign in 2012 saw the Waka Waka light go into mass-production, with 75,000 having been shipped around the world to date. The product itself provides 80 hours of light after one day of charge, offering an alternative to the kerosine lamp. A second Kickstarter campaign allowed the Waka Waka Power to go into production, combing the original light with a solar battery charger. The company ran a 'buy one give one' campaign, in which every sale saw a unit sent to Haiti, reaching an estimated 50,000 people. Fenix ReadySet Founded in 2009, Fenix International is a venture-backed renewable energy company. Another crowdfunding success, its ReadySet solar-powered battery charger aim to reach those off the grid, providing not only a means to energy, but the potential for employment and income too, such as a recharging shop in Uganda. The company is currently patenting a mobile payment system to allow further ease of access to their product. BuffaloGrid BuffaloGrid was founded with the hope to bring power to people, and to allow those in remote, off the grid areas to capitalise on opportunities. Pioneered in Uganda, where 80% of the population has mobile phones but only 5% has access to mains electricity, the system offers customers access to a portable grid. This grid tops up the phone charger when a SMS message is sent, allowing a phone to be charged. This means that vital revenue streams and business opportunities are not lost via traveling long distances to recharge. Econet Solar Home Station Econet Wireless is designed for people with limited access to power grids. Connecting a solar panel to a battery, the Home Station has four USB oulets for charging phones, computers and light sources. The system is currently in use in an estimated 2,000 homes in Zimbabwe. The device is available for a small deposit, making it accessible to those with low income, and is run via a connection to a mobile network. Spor Succesfully funded via a Kickstarter campaign, the Spor solar charger is a portable solar battery, currently available for pre-order. Each individual unit has the capacity of over three standard phone chargers, and the units can be interlinked to create more power. While initial development was geared for the US market, it's portability and ease of use could see it become a useful tool for those off the grid.

Large-scale solar will triple in size, with Arena today announcing the 12 winners of its $92m in grants, which together leverage more than $1bn investment from private companies. The purpose of the grants was to establish a self-sustaining industry of large solar farms, by building competitiveness, bringing down costs and establishing a supply chain for the industry. It appeared to be successful in doing that since, throughout the series of grants, the amount of grant funding needed for each project dropped from $1.60 per MW in 2014 to just 19c today. As a result, projects in the new funding round required only 10% of their cost covered by grants to get off the ground, compared with about half of the cost three years ago. That meant the $92m spent by Arena in this round will be attracting almost $1bn in private investment. “Today’s announcement is a very big deal,” Arena’s chief executive, Ivor Frischknecht, said at an announcement in Sydney. “We have some of the best solar resources in the world, and we lead the world in terms of rooftop solar, but we have been lagging in terms of large-scale solar deployment. That’s about to change over the next 12 months.” When complete, the solar farms will triple the amount of large-scale solar in Australia – from the current 240MW to 720MW – powering 150,000 average Australian homes and fulfilling 10% of the renewable energy target for 2020. The biggest winner of the new grants was Queensland, where six projects would deliver 300.1MW. That will be done with $51.4m from Arena and $637.4m in total investment. Queensland’s minister for energy, Mark Bailey, said at the announcement: “For Queensland, today is a momentous day. We are seeing a new industry start. “It means more than 500 regional jobs, with hundreds of indirect jobs consequently as well, which is fantastic news for communities for instance around Whitsunday and Collinsville, areas that have struggled as the mining industry has gone through a transitional phase.” Arena gave funding to five projects in New South Wales, with a total capacity of 162.3MW and the remaining 20MW project in Western Australia. The chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, Kane Thornton, said: “The holy grail, I think it’s fair to say, is now within reach. And that is the ability to produce electricity from the sun cheaper than any other form of new electricity generation.” Last week, the Turnbull government entered its “omnibus” savings bill to parliament, which seeks to pass all the cuts that Labor agreed to before the election. That includes a $1bn cut to Arena, removing the future capacity of the agency to make grants, potentially making today’s announcement the last round of grants from the agency. Jack Curtis, the Asia-Pacific regional manager at the world’s biggest solar company, FirstSolar, said: “I find it particularly mystifying and disappointing that the government with a stated commitment to innovation and new industry creation would seek to constrain one of its own agencies that has been so effective at contributing to both of these goals.” Thornton said: “These types of extraordinary developments we’ve heard today would essentially be kneecapped. And we think that would be a tragedy for this country.” Solar Citizens, a group that represents and campaigns for solar energy in Australia, analysed which federal seats each of the projects fell into and found all but one were in Coalition-held seats, except for one, which was in Bob Katter’s seat of Kennedy. The national director of Solar Citizens, Claire O’Rourke, told Guardian Australia: “It’s a strong reminder for Coalition MPs, who are tied to efforts to destroy Arena’s future, that Arena projects are helping to fuel regional communities across Australia. “To put it simply – it’s stupid. Stupid politics, stupid economics and stupid policy.” Despite not opposing the measure before the election, Labor has left open the possibility of opposing the cut, which would mean voting against the entire omnibus bill. The Greens’ energy and climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, today urged Labor to block the cuts. “Bill Shorten, don’t kill renewable energy innovation. Don’t kill Arena,” Bandt said. “Bill Shorten needs to listen to energy companies, the CSIRO, university solar researchers and the Australian people who all say Arena’s funding should continue. “Australia could be a renewable energy superpower, yet we have a government intent on sending us back to the dark ages by cutting clean energy while simultaneously handing out billions to the fossil fuel industry and an opposition who may wave through these cuts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/27/green-cuts-renewable-energy-risk-uk-dark-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-27T11:12:20Z","webTitle":"Green cuts risk sending UK back to the dark ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/green-cuts-renewable-energy-risk-uk-dark-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/27/green-cuts-renewable-energy-risk-uk-dark-ages","fields":{"headline":"Green cuts risk sending UK back to the dark ages","bodyText":"The government’s U-turn on renewable energy risks sending this country back to the dark ages of relying only on fossil fuel. Since the election we have seen a slashing of subsidies for biomass, anaerobic digestion and biogas as well as solar and wind. This will make very little difference to household bills but will impact heavily on energy security and in the long-term increase bills with no way back. Renewable energy can actually secure energy prices, giving security for households, whatever fossil fuel prices are. The sudden abolition of these subsidies was, wind power aside, a massive surprise. For a business-friendly government, it is a risky message to send and one that could shake investor confidence. What I don’t understand is why the government would apply the climate change levy on renewable energy plants which are carbon-positive. It’s illogical. Even worse, it removes the business case for existing renewable energy plants that were predicated on the investment avoiding carbon tax until 2023. Without financial justification, it will be very hard for business to invest in renewables again – particularly if there is a worry that any other support could be scrapped at a moment’s notice. Worse still, the government’s logic behind the U-turn is flawed. Working with Imperial College London, we researched the potential of a ‘circular’ economy, an economy which gets full value from natural resources. The research forecast that this economy would be worth an extra £29bn to the UK and would create 175,000 jobs. Rather than stifling the potential of a circular economy, the government needs to encourage it. Instead of removing subsidies, it should expanding them and finding other, creative ways to boost sustainability. In December, the government will be taking part in the UN climate summit in Paris. A global event, incorporating governments and business, it could be a generation-defining event and enable a climate secure future. Paris will perhaps be the last chance to deliver climate security. Of course, energy will be a major pillar of these discussions. Do we really want to be the country stepping back in time? The government needs to accept its environmental and energy responsibilities and bring back subsidies for renewable energy. By doing so, it will help secure this country’s energy future. It will also set the right tone heading into Paris, where we should be a significant force in ensuring global climate security."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-14T14:41:00Z","webTitle":"After the Taliban: taking solar energy to remote parts of Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid","fields":{"headline":"After the Taliban: taking solar energy to remote parts of Afghanistan","bodyText":"Carved into the cliffs behind Bamiyan town centre in Afghanistan's central highlands, massive holes scar the homeland of the Hazara people, a Shia minority who live between the Hindu Kush and Koh-i-Baba mountain ranges. The hollows once housed statues of Buddha, until the Taliban infamously set dynamite to them in 2001. But within a few kilometres of these monuments to tyranny stand symbols of renewal – rows of solar panels bringing stable electricity to the homes of local people for the first time – and with them the chance of improving their lives. The United Nations Development Programme identified the lack of stable, affordable power as the largest obstacle to development in Bamiyan Province, but it is one of many. The Taliban destroyed most of the region's few schools. There is now just one sealed road and droughts are common. The deprivation \"is hard to put into words,\" says Besmellah Jahed, the director of the Rehabilitation and Social Development Organisation, a local NGO. \"They've had 30 years of disappointment, 30 years of failed hope and promises. Hospitals, roads and airports - everything you need for a community to develop, they've been waiting for it to arrive,\" says Tony Woods, a New Zealand entrepreneur whose company Sustainable Energy Services International (Sesi) built the solar power system. Before the solar installation started operating in December, locals had to rely on an expensive, haphazard system of neighbourhood generators, kerosene lamps and tiny, private solar panels to access even the most rudimentary power supply. The Taliban massacres and destruction of the Buddhas ensured the province remains deeply antagonistic toward the counter-insurgency, making it a relatively stable oasis in the fractious countryside. This security has created an environment that encourages investment in infrastructure. Sesi says the 1MW facility is central Asia's largest off-grid solar plant. It powers 2500 homes around the provincial capital, Bamiyan. During the winter months the cells are backed up for a few hours each night by a diesel generator. The New Zealand government, whose army administered the region during the western occupation, backed the installation with a US$14.1m grant. Building in a province surrounded on all sides by war and mountains, with no existing power infrastructure, was a huge logistical challenge, says Woods. Every pole, wire, panel and frame had to be imported. His team of local and foreign workers had to contest with corrupt customs officials, a supply road that sporadically fell under the control of insurgents, the closure of the Pakistani border for eight months and winters so cold their concrete would not set. The project also had to overcome local scepticism bred by bitter experiences. \"They wanted to know if we were going to steal all the money [from their power bills] and take it back to New Zealand,\" says Woods. There was also concern that electricity rates would be too high, despite the fact that residents were paying some of the highest prices in the world. Overcoming scepticism was a case of build it and they will come, says Woods. \"When this project was started, people were doubtful about how much electricity would cost,\" agrees Khalil Rahman Anwari an employee of the Agency for Assistance and Development of Afghanistan. \"After the project started, the demand increased.\" Locals still think prices are too high, pointing out that electricity in Kabul is significantly cheaper. Most people can only run a few appliances. But Anwari says the access to reliable, affordable light makes possible the most simple but important of activities, like homework during the dark winter months. The Afghan government now owns and administers Bamiyan's power supply. Local technicians, including many women, have been trained to operate it. The system uses pre-paid credit, which users buy from banks. This avoids the risk of meter readers being tempted to offer favours to neighbours in the tight-knit community. The accountancy of the project is transparent and can be audited by Sesi and the New Zealand government remotely. Woods says it was important to create a system large enough to become self-sufficient and fund its own growth. But New Zealand's aid commitments to Bamiyan have now been scaled back and only around 5% of the estimated 418,000 people in Bamiyan Province currently receive the project's electricity. Jahed, who was born in Bamiyan, says growth into other parts of the province is imperative. People have already started crowding into the areas supplied by power. The provincial government had promised those who lack power would be supplied by generators, but this has not happened. \"Bamiyan people are very kind and appreciate any minor development,\" he says. \"But this is not sufficient. We suggest the extension of this project.\" Read more stories like this: • Chile's solar market is leading the way in South America • Could renewable energy make rural electrification a reality? • Quiz: what do you know about renewable energy?

The World Energy Council blamed the government’s lack of clarity and myriad changes which it said have left the country facing a potential gap in energy supply. The UK has previously been one of the top performers in the council’s “Trillema Index”, which has ranked countries on energy security, costs and decarbonisation efforts for the last six years. But the Brexit vote, cuts to renewable energy subsidies and planned changes on foreign ownership have created investment uncertainty and significant challenges for the UK, according to the latest edition of the index for the London-headquartered agency, whose members include energy companies across the world. The UK was also added to a watchlist of countries where negative changes are expected imminently, alongside the US, Germany and Japan. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland took the top three positive slots in the ranking, with the UK now 11th. Despite the recent decision to go ahead with new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset, the UK had a “distinct lack of policy direction”, the council’s chief said. “Challenges in terms of improving affordability, and delivering security of supply as North Sea assets deplete, coupled with the rundown of worn-out legacy infrastructure, including coal-fired generation, has left the UK with a potential energy gap,” said Joan MacNaughton, executive chair of the council. “Renewables are increasing as a percentage of the UK energy mix but their output is not yet at a level where energy security can be guaranteed.” She added that ministers had not helped by making “myriad different changes” since 2013. It was not clear if Theresa May’s new government would back the “dash for gas” approach pushed by the former chancellor George Osborne under the last administration, said MacNaughton, adding that no alternative to gas had been made clear either. Gas has come to supply around half of the UK’s electricity generation this year, up from around a third in 2015, as several major coal plants shut. The result of the EU referendum vote in July has also cast a cloud over the government’s pledge last year to phase out coal power by 2025, as leaving the single market as part of a hard Brexit “could significantly increase the cost of its energy imports”. Imports via interconnectors to the continent accounted for around 6% of the UK’s electricity supply last year. Planned changes to rules on foreign ownership of energy infrastructure, announced during May’s review of Hinkley Point C contract, added to the investment uncertainty, the report said. The council also highlighted government cuts to onshore wind and solar subsidies since it took power, which Office for National Statistics figures showed last week had led solar power installations to crash. The changes could hinder investments in those sectors, the council said. The longer term future of support for low-carbon energy was unclear too, said MacNaughton. “The market knows some of what to expect until 2020 but after this point there are no answers to how the country will finance the low-carbon transition.” Dr Colin Brown, director of engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: “This report confirms that the UK government’s lack of clear energy policy is threatening the country’s future energy security.” He added: “The recent approval of the Hinkley Point C nuclear, while promising, is only part of the solution to the UK securing its low carbon energy requirements for the future.” Former Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, tweeted that the report showed the UK was a case study in “how not to run an energy policy.” A spokesman for the government said: “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable and an absolute priority. We do not leave this up to chance, and the measures we have put in place through the capacity market, mean that homes and businesses will continue to have the supplies they need as we build an energy infrastructure fit for the 21st century. “The UK is a global leader in attracting investment and we are already seeing the fruits from this in our energy infrastructure with more offshore wind, solar energy and nuclear capacity being developed across the country. We will continue to work with industry and other key stakeholders to ensure that our future energy supplies remain clean, secure and affordable.” In a speech on Monday, the energy minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, said that new nuclear would have a key role to play for the UK in ensuring security of supply, affordability and decarbonising the sector. “What might this look like in practice [meeting those criteria]? Where better to start than with Hinkley and nuclear new-build. Britain has a 60-year history as a global leader in nuclear power. Yet after the completion of the last new nuclear plant, Sizewell B in 1995, which I remember seeing while it was under construction, the nuclear industry was regrettably left to atrophy,” she told a summit in London. Offshore windfarms could also play a role if the industry drives down costs, and the safe extraction of shale gas could help on affordability and supply, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/16/solar-power-race-is-on-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-16T15:27:27Z","webTitle":"The rush for solar power: buy now, before it's too late","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-power-race-is-on-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-power-race-is-on-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"The rush for solar power: buy now, before it's too late","bodyText":"“The biggest challenge was the grid connection,” says Donna Clarke with satisfaction. Clarke has worked in renewables for 15 years, and developed the UK’s only biodiesel plant before moving into solar energy. When the company she now works for, Scottow Moor Solar, arrived at RAF Coltishall in May last year, there was no means to plug the 50MW (megawatts) of power they thought could be generated on the former airfield – enough to run 15,000 homes – into the electricity supply. Nearly 18 months later, with phase one of East Anglia’s biggest solar farm completed on schedule in March, and a second phase planned, there are not one, but two connections to carry 33MW of power. One 7MW connection was bought from a developer whose planning application for two wind turbines had been refused following local objections. Negotiating a route for the other 26MW was more complicated, as the local grid was at full capacity, but Scottow Moor founder David Fyffe managed to persuade UK Power Networks (UKPN) to support a pilot, flexible-connection scheme, meaning the power can be turned down or “curtailed” when not needed. Phase two of the project will require a third connection for a further 20MW of power – bringing the total output to 50MW, making Scottow Moor one of the UK’s biggest solar farms. When I visited the site last month, there was a palpable sense of relief. Decommissioned military bases, with their poor infrastructure and decrepit buildings, are notoriously awkward to develop. But here in Norfolk, Scottow Moor’s backers think they’ve hit on a winning scheme – and in the nick of time. As the second phase of the Guardian’s Keep It in the Ground campaign has highlighted, solar power has gone through a remarkable period of growth since the demoralising Copenhagen climate summit in 2009: in the intervening six years, the cost of panels has fallen by 70%, with the government’s target of 750,000 domestic solar installations by 2020 reached this year. Following her promotion in May, energy secretary Amber Rudd promised to “unleash a new solar revolution”, singling out commercial rooftop developments, still a relative rarity in the UK, and perhaps thinking too of her Hastings constituents with their sun-kissed, southern roofs. But just three months later, she was announcing drastic cuts. In the next few weeks, Rudd, who used to work under chancellor George Osborne in the Treasury, will decide whether or not to reduce by almost 90% the feed-in tariff that subsidises small-scale solar installations, such as household roofs, from 1 January 2016. A consultation closes next week. For those considering installing solar panels, the race is already on. In the weeks since Rudd’s about-turn, several companies have already gone bust. “The rush is there. We are seeing it at many levels – large and small-scale, commercial rooftop, schools and residential,” says Reza Shaybani, chairman of the British Photovoltaic Association (BPVA). “I’m taking calls from members saying they will be doing the equivalent of eight months’ installations in the next three months, and as you can imagine, that will have an impact on safety and quality. No matter who you are, if you rush, you cut corners.” At Scottow Moor, the challenge was to get hold of and install 133,560 panels by the end of March to ensure that the project qualified for ROCs (Renewable Obligation Certificates). ROCs were one of the government’s ways of subsidising renewable energy projects greater than 5MW, until they were withdrawn from new, ground-mounted solar farms this year. The £30m project was completed in seven weeks, using 20 contractors, including three different suppliers of panels because one company could not make them quickly enough. Project manager Gareth Hawkins calls Scottow Moor “the fastest per-MW build in Europe”. The 600-acre site, which is a conservation area covered in listed buildings with a prison for sex offenders at one edge, is owned by Norfolk county council, and when I visited council leader George Nobbs was on hand to celebrate. With his white hair, pink tie and a red handkerchief in his top pocket, Nobbs cuts a genial and jaunty figure. “We’re one big happy family,” he says of Labour’s alliance with Liberal Democrats and Ukip, which ensures Labour and not the Conservatives leads the council, with support from the Greens. It was a Lib Dem, John Timewell, who suggested a solar farm in the first place, Nobbs says, and planning permission was granted by two Conservative-run district councils. After our interview, Nobbs gamely agrees to try to catch up with the sheep grazing under the panels for the Guardian’s photographer, so we can show how, on this flat patch of Norfolk, solar and livestock coexist (but sadly the sheep run away). Coltishall was bought for £4m under the previous council administration three years ago, and the deal with Scottow Moor Solar means Nobbs has now made this money back. Now he and his colleagues have to attract businesses to the empty offices and aircraft hangars that have been rebranded Scottow Enterprise Park, but have so far escaped the attention of satnav: the taxi driver who took me there could find no trace of street name or postcode. Everyone seems very pleased that TV company October Films has moved in, and plans to make a programme involving fast cars on the runway once used by Hurricanes and Spitfires and saved for reasons of nostalgia (the local village is called Badersfield, after fighter pilot Douglas Bader, who was briefly based here). More recently, says Hawkins, one of Scottow Moor’s investors used it to land a helicopter. Whether plans to regenerate the area economically will succeed remains to be seen. There have been complications: Scottow Moor Solar has already spent more than £350,000 having the site swept for ammunition. The council would like the park to become a hub for green businesses, and phase two of the solar farm will provide electricity to the four aircraft hangars it hopes to let. But if the story so far is one of success – of co-operation between the public and private sectors; of a local farmer working with developers (the grazing arrangements don’t work with cows or horses that are too heavy and can damage equipment, so it’s sheep or nothing); of cross-party co-operation and a community with strong feelings about its military heritage brought on side through consultation – both the politicians and developers who made it happen fear there won’t be many more like it. Partly because of the March cut-off for some subsidies, 2015 has been a bumper year for solar. Britain added more capacity last year than any other European country, and July set a new record, when on one glorious summer’s day 16% of all UK electricity was sun-powered – with around half coming from domestic rooftops, the rest from solar farms. In the same month Greg Barker, energy minister until he stood down from parliament in May, was named president of the British Photovoltaic Association (BPVA). In September, a poll for ICM found solar the most popular form of energy among voters of all parties – with 30% naming it their favourite, compared with 15% for nuclear and 13% for gas – and 78% saying the government should do more to help communities generate their own power. Solar was on a roll. But the recent change in government policy has cast a sudden shadow. Even if the government rows back on the extreme cuts proposed, as some of its own MPs would like it to, there is no doubt subsidies will shrink, and an industry set to deliver 1GW of new solar per year will have to scale back – with domestic and small-scale rooftop installations the most obvious victims, even though policy has been to support these in preference to ground-mounted solar on agricultural land. In the meantime, those companies that can are doing their best to make hay while the sun shines. Shaybani says the industry was prepared for a shock; orders were placed in advance and as a result, there is no shortage of modules right now. But a binge, he says, is the last thing the industry needs – especially when this looks set to be followed by a period of starvation. Since the subsidy cuts are in the cause of saving money – higher-than-expected demand for solar having led to overspending of the budget – he argues that by stimulating a run on solar panels, the government is making things worse. While he likens previous changes in the subsidy regime to bumps in the road, the industry is now, he says, at “the edge of a cliff”. “The redundancies we have seen are the tip of the iceberg,” he continues. “In any business, if your number of customers is limited you don’t need a big team.” Sonia Dunlop, spokesperson for the Solar Trade Association, agrees. “The industry already had a plan to wean itself off subsidies between 2020 and 2025,” she says, “but the caveat was that we needed a stable policy framework to get us there. It’s about energy independence and investment in cheaper energy over 20-30 years. For most people it’s definitely not a green thing.” Back in Norfolk, Clarke and Hawkins are getting stuck into phase 2 of Scottow Moor Solar’s farm. Around 43,000 more ground-mounted panels will be here by next spring, with work beginning in December. “Speed creates challenges, especially when there are complex issues to deal with around the grid,” says Clarke, “but we think our experience means this time round there will be few surprises. Obviously, the uncertainty around policy is not helpful. But this is a project that was always going to be completed. There is a need on site for this electricity supply, and locally it’s got a lot of support.” How many similar projects will get off the ground and whether, if they do, smaller rooftop solar will be squeezed out, remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-sees-record-daily-deaths-as-world-bank-warns-60m-to-fall-into-extreme-poverty","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-20T23:42:40Z","webTitle":"Greece to restart tourism from 15 June – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-sees-record-daily-deaths-as-world-bank-warns-60m-to-fall-into-extreme-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-sees-record-daily-deaths-as-world-bank-warns-60m-to-fall-into-extreme-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Greece to restart tourism from 15 June – as it happened","bodyText":"We’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, as cases worldwide increase by the highest one-day total so far: UK Ministers overruled permanent secretaries 11 times during pandemic Ministers responding to the coronavirus pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered their departments to override formal objections from their most senior civil servant, a report by Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found. In its first assessment of the government’s finances since responses began four months ago, the National Audit Office (NAO) disclosed that permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were conducted quickly and without the usual “value for money” checks. Secretaries of state issued ministerial directions to force the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable for the decisions, auditors said. There have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years, according to the Institute for Government. Apple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. The companies had announced the unprecedented collaboration to leverage their technology to help trace and contain the spread of coronavirus last month, and say 22 countries and several US states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. The software relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus. Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are omitting from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns. World sees largest daily rise in cases. The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours – the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. “The question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.“I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,” the US president tweeted on Wednesday. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all – normalization!” International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. “The tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,” Mitsotakis said in a televised address. South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country’s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the “salaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation” of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system. The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months. The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to “stay focused on life-saving interventions”. The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for “mass worldwide killing”. Trump referred to an unidentified “wacko in China”, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries – including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years – after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Here is more on US president Donald Trump calling for an in-person G7 meeting. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,” the US president tweeted on Wednesday. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all – normalization!” In March, the Republican president canceled the physical summit scheduled for June, moving to a video conference as nations grappled with the shutdown of international travel and multiple closures to fight the outbreak. The leaders’ April and May discussions were also moved to teleconference. But Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, said an in-person summit would be a symbol of the United States and other countries seeking to return to normal, something the president has urged should happen quickly despite concerns from public health experts. As we reported earlier, French president, Emmanuel Macron, is open to traveling to the United States for an in-person meeting of G7 leaders if the coronavirus pandemic situation allows, an Elysee official said on Wednesday. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I’ll be bringing you all the latest – please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan at any time. In Brazil, 888 more people have died after becoming infected, while the country’s Health Ministry has confirmed a record increase in cases, with nearly 20,000 reported. That takes the total to 291,579. In the UK, overseas health and care workers on the coronavirus frontline have reacted with fury after Boris Johnson refused to exempt them from the NHS surcharge, insisting that it was “the right way forward”. In interviews with the Guardian’s Sarah Marsh and Harriet Grant, migrant health workers – who face an NHS bill of as much as £2,500 a year for a family of four – spoke out over a relentless working environment, struggles to pay their rent, and a heavy toll on their family life. “We feel insulted,” one said. “We are putting our lives and our family’s lives at risk.” The prime minister resisted pressure from Labour’s Keir Starmer to amend the policy, telling MPs that he “accepts and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff” but added: “We must look at the realities … those contributions help us to raise about £900m.” Later, the IFS estimated that the contribution from overseas NHS staff amounted to around £90m. The head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has appealed for the world to work together to develop a vaccine, warning against any unilateral action that could prevent access for poor countries. Francesco Rocca, who heads the world’s largest disaster relief network, told Reuters: The reality is that there is this risk. Everyone must have access to these lifesaving treatments. On Tuesday, the United States rejected language in a World Health Organization resolution that was designed to ensure poor countries can have access to medicine, arguing that it sends “the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs”. Rocca said: If someone would say this is the intellectual property of this company ... and putting high prices on the vaccines, so making it impossible or very difficult to have access, this of course can have an impact on the most vulnerable. We want to prevent some unilateral decision that can effect the opportunity to have treatments and vaccines for everyone. Neglecting indigenous people during the pandemic is a “crime against humanity”, the mayor of the largest city in the Amazon rainforest has said. Arthur Virgilio Neto, the mayor of Manaus, said the virus is killing indigenous people and warned of a “genocide” if Brazil’s right-wing government fails to protect vulnerable tribes. So far, 25 indigenous people have died in the rainforest as the outbreak slowly penetrates remote villages. But more than 100 have been killed by the virus in urban areas, health authorities and indigenous groups said. “I fear a genocide,” said Neto, whose city is home to 2 million people and is the capital of Amazonas state. The mayor said the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was not concerned about the plight of indigenous people and doing nothing to save lives threatened by the outbreak. “It is a crime against humanity what they are doing here in my state of Amazonas, in my region.” he said. Bolsonaro’s office did not reply to Reuters’ requests for comment. Healthcare for indigenous people is the responsibility of the federal health ministry and its indigenous health service Sesai, which does not treat members of a tribe who have migrated away from their ancestral lands. Health experts say the outbreak that first broke out in the cities is now spreading to isolated areas where the population has no access to healthcare. Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday they were particularly concerned about contagion in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country’s health ministry has said. The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. The mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and the child subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 as well. It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying condition of prematurity. South Africa, which has the highest coronavirus infections in Africa, reported 803 new cases in a 24-hour cycle, taking the total to 18,003 while 8,950 people have recovered. Peru’s number of confirmed cases has surpassed 100,000, the country’s Ministry of Health has reported. There are 104,020 in the South American nation, which has been under nationwide lockdown since March, and the death toll rose to 3,024, the ministry said. Capt Tom Moore, whose sponsored walks in his garden raised £33m for NHS charities, has reacted with delight after it was confirmed he is to be knighted. “I think Sir Thomas sounds very nice,” he said. But he insisted the new title wouldn’t change him. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,324 more deaths and 23,405 new cases; taking the totals to 91,664 and 1,528,235, respectively. A team of nurses working in Mexico City on the pandemic were rescued from a “virtual” kidnapping, in which kidnappers threaten their victims via telephone and video calls and coerce them through deception into making extortion payments. Investigators say the virtual kidnappers targeted the nurses – all staying in two hotels in the Mexican capital – and called their family members, saying they were being held and would be harmed if payment was not forthcoming. The nurses were warned not to try leaving their rooms; their virtual captors claimed to have control of the hotels’ security cameras and said they would attack any of the nurses if they were seen in the street. The Mexican Social Security Institute said in a statement that 13 of the 17 nurses in the team were subjected to the virtual kidnapping and were rescued by security forces on Tuesday. None of the nurses were injured and no arrests have been made. Judicial officials in the Mexican capital say detectives working on the case of a kidnapped Chiapas man stumbled upon the virtual kidnapping. The case of the virtual kidnappings was but the latest in a string of indignities committed against members of the medical profession as the Covid-19 pandemic escalates. Doctors, nurses and paramedics – all applauded in other countries – have suffered aggressions in public, including having bleach thrown on them. Many in the medical profession have stopped wearing their uniforms in public to avoid being assailed by people perceiving them as Covid-19 risks. Virtual kidnappings have proliferated in Mexico in recent years. Gerardo Priego, a former lawmaker now running an anti-kidnapping organisation, says such virtual crimes are often “so well-planned that many people fall into them and they are tricked so that their family members pay ... It’s very profitable and the bad guys don’t run any risks.” Brazil’s health ministry has issued new guidelines for wider use of anti-malarial drugs in mild coronavirus cases, a treatment touted by President Jair Bolsonaro in defiance of public health experts warning of possible health risks. The interim health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an army general on active duty, authorised the modified protocol after two trained doctors left the ministry’s top job under pressure to promote early use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The French president Emmanuel Macron is open to travelling to the United States for an in-person meeting of Group of Seven leaders if the coronavirus epidemic situation allows, an Elysee official has said. He’s open, he’s even willing to go there, but obviously with this caveat: Only if the sanitary conditions allow. Donald Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, had planned to hold this year’s summit at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Maryland, in June. In the UK, the test-and-trace system could be jeopardised by delays in obtaining test results, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned, as the government’s scientific advisers prepare to assess its effectiveness. Heather Stewart, Dan Sabbagh and Robert Booth write that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to grill the test-and-trace boss Dido Harding on Thursday amid concerns about whether the system will be robust enough to check the spread of the disease and allow the easing of lockdown measures from 1 June. Hunt, who has repeatedly called for “test, track and isolate” to be implemented, warned that a well-functioning system required test results to be rapidly obtainable. He said: For test and trace to work, you have to get the test results back quickly, and that will mean ironing out a lot of the problems that currently exist, with people waiting too long for their test results. All of Egypt’s 320 general hospitals are to offer testing to people showing symptoms, local authorities have announced. People with minor symptoms will be sent home as they await test results, while those showing serious symptoms will be kept in hospital, according to a government statement. Since 14 May, some patients with minor symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home rather than in quarantine hospitals. Egypt confirmed 745 new cases on Wednesday; the highest daily increase yet, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 14,229. The health ministry reported 21 more deaths, raising total deaths to 680. The number of people confirmed to have recovered stands at 3,994. The diplomatic clash between Beijing and Washington continues as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calls China’s pledge of $2bn (£1.63bn) a “paltry” sum compared to the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars of damage. Pompeo rejected Chinese president Xi Jinping’s claim that Beijing had acted with transparency after the initial outbreak and said that, if Xi wanted to show transparency, he should hold a news conference and allow reporters to ask him anything they liked. “President Xi claimed this week that China is acting with openness, transparency responsibility. I wish it were so,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference, accusing Beijing of continuing to withhold virus samples and access to facilities, to censor discussion, “and much, much more”. He added: I look forward to seeing them fulfil that $2bn commitment. China’s contributions to fighting the pandemic are paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world. This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives, more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives. Could be as much as $9tn, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party’s failures. Pundits have speculated that Donald Trump’s reelection strategy will focus on diverting attention from his own handling of the epidemic in the US by blaming China, where the pandemic started. The plan, a roadmap for the key industry, foresees tourist resorts welcoming holidaymakers two weeks earlier than expected. Initially, Mitsotakis had said “in the best case scenario” Greece would be accepting tourists from 1 July. But seeking to capitalise on the country’s unexpectedly successful handling of the pandemic, he announced that seasonal hotels could open from 15 June. The first tourists are expected to enter the country by car from neighbouring Balkan states that have also recorded low infection and mortality rates. With Athens keen to attract holidaymakers from the UK, its primary market, tax cuts were also announced. In a bid to make Greece more competitive for tour operators due to seal package deals in the coming days, the centre-right leader said duties on transport will be reduced from 24% to 13 % for the next five months. That would make boat, plane and bus tickets cheaper during the tourist season. Taxes on coffee, soft drinks and tickets for open-air cinemas, a mainstay of any Greek summer, will also be slashed. Greece has revved up the engines of its tourism industry, announcing that holidaymakers will be able to return to its beaches within weeks. In an address to the nation, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis declared 15 June as the official start date of a tourist season delayed by the pandemic. Direct flights between Greece and the UK and other international destinations will resume on 1 July, with airlines flying straight into island airports gradually thereafter. Holidaymakers will not be quarantined but they will be tested, Mitsotakis insisted in an attempt to allay fears of the virus being imported from abroad. Here are the latest headlines in the global coronavirus crisis: Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. “The question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. That’s it from me, Damien Gayle. I’ll leave you in the capable hands of my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. The discovery of new coronavirus cases in two students has marred the reopening of schools in South Korea, Reuters reports. Seventy-five high schools turned pupils away on Wednesday, amid fears among some teachers that it was unsafe for classes to resume. Some students were sent home almost as soon as they had walked through their school gates for the first time this year, after the two high school seniors tested positive in Incheon on Wednesday morning, the education ministry said. The beginning of the spring semester had been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online. South Korea has reported 11,110 coronavirus cases, with 263 deaths. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries – including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years – after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian global development reporter Peter Beaumont. The agency has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises. Still suffering from a fall in donations from the public in the UK because of the Haiti sex abuse scandal, and heavily dependent on its shops in a number of European countries – to the tune of £5m a week – Oxfam’s other sources of funding had also begun drying up. Oxfam Australia had already made deep cuts earlier this month, while cuts in the UK to Oxfam GB were also foreseen. Oxfam currently operates in 66 countries and 20 affiliates. It will retain a physical presence in 48 countries, six of which it will explore as new independent affiliate members. The UK has reported 363 more deaths from Covid-19, taking the official death toll in Europe’s worst-affected country to 35,704. According to the daily update, out of 60,744 people tested for the coronavirus, 2,472 came back positive. There have been 248,293 officially confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK so far - the second highest number in Europe. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. “The tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,” Mitsotakis said in a televised address, according to AFP. With Greece suffering fewer than 170 COVID-19 deaths over two months into the pandemic, Mitsotakis said the country’s prompt response to the virus would be a “passport of safety, credibility and health” to attract visitors. “We will win the economy war just as we won the health battle,” he said. The tourism minister, Harry Theocharis, said a list of nations resuming flights to Greece would be announced by the end of May, noting that Athens would focus on reviving a travel front “from the Balkans to the Baltic.” Bulgarians and northern Europeans including Germans will be among the first visitors, the minister said, in addition to Israelis and Cypriots. The country, which is still recovering from a decade-long debt crisis, badly needs tourism income that directly and indirectly accounts for over a fifth of its economy. In Chile, political opponents, academics and health workers have demanded greater transparency over Covid-19 death tolls, writes Charis McGowan in Santiago. With 53,617 confirmed cases of infection, Chile has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in South America. With a case-fatality rate of around 1% (totalling 544), Chile’s Health Ministry has pointed out that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%. However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by “respiratory disease” between 3 March and 29 April. Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year’s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus. The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media. Within hours of the post going viral, the Health Ministry clarified that numbers confirmed by the Department of Health Statistics and Information totalled 1,949 respiratory-related deaths from March to May, an 8% increase to the year before. “Each institution maintains its responsibilities within the scope of its competence,” said the Health Ministry in a statement to the Guardian. “The Health Ministry maintains the responsibility of establishing and defining the codification of the cause of death.” Meanwhile, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) revealed that all official death statistics in Chile must be cross-checked by the Health Ministry, the Civil Registry, and the INE — a process that takes up to two years to verify and validate before publishing. “The Health Ministry’s numbers appeared within hours in response to a tweet,” Matus told the Guardian. “Officially, they haven’t even finished processing the numbers from 2018. So how are these new numbers any more valid than the Civil Registry ones?” Speaking on a local radio station last Friday, the health minister, Jamie Mañalich, explained that the Civil Registry counts respiratory illness as a cause of death in combination with principal causes of death. “It includes a person who has bronchial asthma and who died in a traffic accident,” he said. Yet the discrepancy between the numbers has caused concern. “It is not acceptable that Civil Registry figures are not consistent with those provided by the Ministry of Health,” said deputy Andrea Parra. The Doctor’s Union has demanded greater transparency over death tolls, highlighting that current figures include “anomalous data”. Switzerland has told its ministry of defence to secure adequate supplies of coronavirus vaccine, as fears grow of a global struggle over supplies when one is finally developed. So far, no vaccine has so far been created to protect people from the virus, but it is widely thought that the crisis can only be brought to an end when one is deelopmed and rolled out to huge numbers of the world’s population. Concerns are growing that some nations, such as the United States, could seek to hoard a successful candidate, once it comes, since manufacturing capacity is unlikely to be sufficient to supply global needs. Even after the first wave of the pandemic is over, immunity levels around the world will be so low that vaccine will be essential, Reuters reported the Swiss government as saying, potentially sparking a race by nations to grab what they can, to the detriment of others. “The goal is clear: The Swiss population should have the fastest possible access to a safe, effective vaccine,” Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset said. “But we also know there’s a big, global discussion going on, and need will be huge worldwide. All countries should have fair access to a vaccine.” Switzerland’s interior ministry and defence department have been given the job of leading contract negotiations to secure enough doses to treat the nation’s 8.6 million population, the government said, estimating costs at around 300 million Swiss francs ($310.82 million) for such a supply. Nearly two-dozen people have escaped from coronavirus quarantine centres in Zimbabwe, the Associated Press reports, citing local media. The state-run Herald newspaper reported that 23 people had escaped in the past week, including 19 who were being held at a hotel in Beitbridge, a usually busy border town. The Zimbabwean authorities are using schools, colleges and hotels for the mandatory isolation of people entering the country during a lockdown that is now in its sixth week. Some returnees have complained about poor conditions at quarantine centres. Zimbabwe has so far reported 46 cases of coronavirus, and four deaths from Covid-19. Egypt will deduct 1% from people’s salaries for 12 months from 1 July to offset the economic repercussions of the coronavirus, according to a draft law approved by the cabinet on Wednesday, Reuters reports. The tax will be imposed across all sectors of the economy in both the public and private sectors for net monthly salaries exceeding 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($127), the cabinet said in a statement. A tax of 0.5% will be deducted from state pensions. The measure comes as Egypt tries to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic, which has brought tourism to a standstill, triggered major capital flight, and threatened remittances from Egyptians working overseas. On Wednesday, Egypt reported that 745 more people had tested positive for coronavirus and 21 people had died from Covid-19. The total death toll in the country is now 680, of a total 14,229 confirmed cases. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 161 on Wednesday, one fatality less than on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 32,330, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian’s Rome correspondent. New infections increased by 665, down from 813 on Tuesday, according to figures from the civil protection authority. Mayors of towns and cities across Italy threatened to close bars again after seeing images of crowds gathering for an evening drink on Tuesday, with many people not wearing masks. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, warned “now is not the time for street parties”. “Otherwise the curve starts heading back up,” he was quoted by Ansa as saying. “We lifted the need for self-declaration forms [previously required for venturing out] because the curve was under control, but nobody should think that the rules of precaution have been lifted.” There are 62,752 people who are currently infected with the virus, 676 of whom are in intensive care. The country has 227,364 confirmed coronavirus cases to date, including the deaths and 132,282 survivors. Churches and other places of worship can reopen in Switzerland from next week, the government announced on Wednesday, AFP reports. “Normal life is coming back,” the health minister, Alain Berset, said after the government brought the move forward by a week. “Mass, worship, marriages, baptisms” and other events in places of worship will all be allowed to resume from 28 May, he told a press conference. Switzerland stopped short of imposing strict confinement in measures introduced in mid-March aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. It has been gradually lifting its restrictions since barbers, florists, family doctors and hardware stores were allowed to reopen on 27 April. The rates of infection, hospitalisation and death have flattened off in recent weeks, according to the health ministry. On Wednesday, Swiss public health authorities reported one new Covid-19 death, and 40 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total death toll from the disease so far in the country now stands at 1,630, out of 30,658 infected patients. The prime minister of Italy has warned that the EU’s coronavirus recovery plan needs to be more ambitious or the bloc risked fuelling nationalism and widening long-term divisions. While he welcomed the surprise entente between Berlin and Paris to back a 500 billion euro ($550 billion) rescue plan as “a bold and significant step”, Giuseppe Conte said “much more needs to be done”. In an op-ed on the politico.eu news website, Conte said: It has quickly become clear that the economic cost of this pandemic is going to be as unprecedented as its impact to public health, putting in danger not just jobs and business in EU member countries but also threatening the fundamental pillars of our union, starting with the single market and the supply chains it facilitates. By its nature, the coronavirus crisis is a symmetric shock, affecting all countries and regions, that cannot be effectively faced by individual countries alone. It did not take me long to be convinced of this, and I have been raising awareness among other European leaders about the urgent need for a coordinated economic response. The risk has long been clear: Europe cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by doing too little or reacting too slowly. Failure to act swiftly will result in a sharp widening of divergences among EU member countries. Four European countries - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden - are expected to propose an alternative to the Franco-German recovery plan, asking for more guarantees that states receiving aid will adopt reforms, AFP reports. They will also say aid should take the form of loans rather than grants, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Wednesday. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by super-cyclone Amphan, writes Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian’s south-east Asia correspondent. Rights groups say governments are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, and warn those on board may have been at sea for months. Amnesty said the refugees’ lives are at immediate risk, as the Bay of Bengal, where some boats were recently rescued, is facing its biggest storm for decades. It’s thought that some of the boats are carrying refugees attempting to flee the desperate conditions in Cox’s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, where 1 million Rohingya refugees have sheltered for years after fleeing persecution in Myanmar. The location of the boats is not known, though last week it was reported that at least two vessels carrying Rohingya were believed to have been spotted off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh. “They are in rickety boats, these are fishing trawlers that they use to take a very dangerous route in the hope of a better life. The Bangladesh government and others must do everything to save their lives,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s south Asia campaigner. Louise Donovan, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, added that it is not clear how exactly many people remain adrift but that the storm could be devastating for those stranded. “The sea is extremely rough at the moment, and if there are any boats that are trying to disembark we would ask governments in the region to assist them,” she said. Earlier this month, hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, were rescued from another boat and escorted by Bangladesh to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island that aid groups warn is isolated and prone to flooding and cyclones. The UN has offered to conduct a risk assessment of the island prior to any refugees being relocated, but this is yet to happen. On Wednesday, authorities in Bangladesh said the 306 Rohingya who remain on the island have been taken to cyclone centres. Officials have previously said that rescued Rohingya were being taken to Bhasan Char as a quarantine measure, to prevent the risk of people bringing coronavirus into the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. Just last week, the virus had been detected for the first time in the crowded camps, prompting agencies to warn of a looming humanitarian disaster. In Cox’s Bazar on Wednesday morning, a third red flag was raised as a warning sign that extreme weather is approaching and that all refugees must stay inside. It is hoped that the eye of the cyclone will miss the camp, though agencies still fear flooding, tidal surges and strong winds that could tear apart the flimsy shelters in which families live. There are no cyclone shelters available to refugees in the camps, instead, communities have been given “tie-down kits”, sets of pegs and ropes, to try to strengthen the structures that do exist. “We’re as prepared as we can be in a very difficult situation and also when dealing with Covid-19 at the same time it is very, very challenging,” added Donovan. “The United States continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the US state department has insisted. A lengthy press release published the USAID website, but in the name of the department of state, says that, despite Donald Trump’s threats to permanently end US funding of the World Health Organization, the US government is still distributing billions to countries and NGOs for coronavirus relief efforts. It says: Through the American people’s generosity and the U.S. Government’s action, the United States continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. The American people have given more than $10 billion that will benefit the global Covid-19 response, and we continue to ensure that the substantial U.S. funding and scientific efforts on this front remain a central and coordinated part of the worldwide effort against Covid-19. Months into fighting this pandemic at home and abroad, the United States continues to lead a global response—building on decades of leadership in life-saving health and humanitarian assistance. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the US Government has committed more than $900 million in State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance specifically aimed at helping governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) fight the pandemic. This funding, provided by Congress, will save lives by improving public health education; protecting healthcare facilities; and increasing laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity in more than 120 countries. The United States has mobilized as a nation to make this an impressive global effort. Working with the private sector, we have begun to fulfill President Trump’s commitment to provide ventilators to our partners and allies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The first shipment of ventilators donated by the United States, through USAID, arrived in the Republic of South Africa on May 11, 2020. Our foreign assistance funding to date for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes an initial $23 million specifically to provide ventilators to some of these partners and allies. We expect to make future additional purchases and shipments of ventilators and related supplies. You can read more by clicking through. Peru seemed to be doing everything right. Its president, Martín Vizcarra, announced one of the earliest coronavirus lockdowns in Latin America on 16 March. In stark contrast to his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro – who has deliberately undermined social distancing and quarantine measures – Peru’s leader strictly adhered to the World Health Organization’s coronavirus recommendations and mobilised the police and army to enforce a stringent quarantine. But more than two months later the country is one of the region’s worst hit by Covid-19 and has been unable to flatten the curve of infections. Peru now ranks second only to Brazil in Latin America with more than 99,483 cases and a death toll of 2,914 according to official figures on Tuesday. Dan Collyns, the Guardian’s man in Lima, looks into the reasons why: Just over 7% of people in Stockholm are carrying antibodies that would protect them against coronavirus infection, a survey by Sweden’s public health authority has found. The findings come from the first results of the agency’s investigation into the presence of antibodies against the virus in the population. They will be likely to be seized upon by critics of Sweden’s “herd immunity” strategy. The country has eschewed the kinds of lockdowns imposed by government’s elsewhere in the world to curb the spread of the virus, in favour of allowing it to spread throughout the population in the hope that natural immunity will be achieved. So far Sweden has recorded 3,831 deaths from Covid-19, a far higher total death toll than its neighbours, which brought in strict lockdown measures. Stockholm, the capital, has been the worst hit region. According to the public health authority’s press release on the study (rendered into English by Google Translate): The analyses for week 18 (a total of 1,104 analysed samples) show, as expected, the largest proportion of positive antibody tests in Stockholm. A total of 7.3% of the blood samples collected from people in Stockholm were positive in the antibody study, which can be compared with a total of 4.2% in Skåne and 3.7% in Västra Götaland. The numbers reflect the state of the epidemic earlier in April, as it takes a few weeks for the body’s immune system to develop antibodies. Regarding age differences, the results show that Covid-19 antibodies were most common among people between 20 and 64 years. In total, 6.7% of the samples in this group were positive, which can be compared with 4.7% in the age group 0-19 years and 2.7% in the age group 65-70 years. France is to launch a complete shake-up of the country’s health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, but whose failings have been revealed by the coronavirus crisis, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the “salaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation” of staff in hospitals and state-run nursing homes and to invest and reform financing of the health system. After a council of ministers (cabinet) meeting this morning, it was announced the plan will be launched next Monday (25 May) with a national consultation. This is Macron’s way of saying thank you to underpaid, overworked hospital and care home staff at the frontline of dealing with Covid-19, Olivier Véran, the French health minister, speaking after the meeting, said. “Nothing will be as it was before. France has seen what it owes its nurses and carers … their work is the pride of the whole nation.” In a brief mea culpa, he said the government had not acted “quickly or strongly enough” in its hospital reforms in recent years. He said “radical measures” were needed to combat the nurses’ “malaise”, and not just pay rises. He said France needed a “health system that was renewed and rearmed and capable of dealing with all risks, all threats”. Thousands of delegates streaming into Beijing for China’s most important political event of the year have undergone nucleic acid tests and quarantines amid what state media have called “wartime measures”, writes Lily Kuo, the Guardian’s Beijing correspondent. The National People’s Congress is usually a two-week affair of pomp and pageantry but this year’s event has been shortened and some sessions will be held over video link. Railway stations have implemented extra screening for travellers coming to the capital and residential communities are meant to maintain strict “close management” – allowing only registered residents in and out. Officials have temporarily banned the sale of petrol in bulk, as well as firecrackers. Balloons for sporting events or other types of aerial advertising are also barred. Even more so than other years, it is critical that the parliamentary session – which coincides with the meeting of an advisory body, collectively known as “two sessions” – goes off without a hitch. The event, a time for China’s political elite to rubber-stamp policies and indicate new policy directions, was delayed for two months because of the coronavirus. In holding the two sessions, which begin on Thursday and Friday, Beijing is not only signalling its victory over the virus but is trying to emphasise control and leadership as it tries to move on from the pandemic. China is in unchartered territory of economic struggle and discontent at home and increased hostility from abroad, which makes the event especially important for its leader, Xi Jinping, who over the years has centralised power and embodies the government’s response to crises. A US drug company has said its experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown to produce protective antibodies and immune responses in mice and guinea pigs, Reuters reports. Inovio is one of dozens of companies and teams around the world racing to produce a vaccine for the virus. Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. David Weiner, director of the vaccine and immunotherapy centre at the Wistar institute, which has collaborated with Inovio, said: We saw antibody responses that do many of the things we would want to see in an eventual vaccine. We are able to target things that would prevent the virus from having a safe harbour in the body. Inovio, which began human testing of its vaccine in April, said preliminary results from that trial are expected in June. Human development - the combination of rises in education, health and living standards - could decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced in 1990, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has said. UNDP said the impact was being felt all over the world, in both rich and poor countries, but added that the pandemic, and the crisis it had caused, was acting as “a magnifying glass for inequalities.” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: The world has seen many crises over the past 30 years, including the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Each has hit human development hard but, overall, development gains accrued globally year-on-year. COVID-19 – with its triple hit to health, education, and income – may change this trend. Countries that are less able to cope with the social and economic fallout of worldwide lockdown would be likely to face a much steeper drop in development, the agency said. Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP, said: This crisis shows that if we fail to bring equity into the policy toolkit, many will fall further behind. This is particularly important for the ‘new necessities’ of the 21st century, such as access to the Internet, which is helping us to benefit from tele-education, tele-medicine, and to work from home. More than a million people in South Africa could be infected by coronavirus, causing at least 40,000 deaths, by the time the disease reaches a likely peak in the country in November, scientists have said. A consortium called the Modelling and Simulation Hub Africa (MASHA), comprising experts from the University of Cape Town and the Department of Health, released its first projections of the impact of the pandemic late Tuesday, according to a report by AFP. In an optimistic scenario there would be just over 40,000 deaths by November, said MASHA’s head, Sheetal Silal. In a pessimistic scenario, the death toll would be 45,000-48,000, she said. Silal stressed the wide degree of uncertainty for making forecasts at this stage. “Here we are trying to make projections on the entire span of the epidemic for the next six to eight months, so there is considerable uncertainty,” she said. South Africa reported its first coronavirus case on 5 March. Its registered tally now stands at 17,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 312 deaths, in a country of 57 million.

In the United States, where Donald Trump continues to point the finger at China, a new nationally-representative survey has shown that the vast majority of the country’s nurses say they have not been tested for Covid-19, are reusing personal protective equipment, or have exposed skin or clothing while caring for coronavirus patients. The survey finds that “dangerous health care workplace conditions have become the norm” since Covid-19 spread widely within the United States, said the union which conducted the survey. More than 100 nurses have died since the beginning of the pandemic. “We’ve known for years we’re behind,” said Jean Ross, president of National Nurses United. Not because we couldn’t have what we needed – because we are the richest country on the planet – but because of greed, because of the profit system that doesn’t really look out for the welfare of patients, therefore it couldn’t possibly look out for the welfare of workers.” The survey asked more than 23,000 nurses across all 50 states and Washington DC about their working conditions since the pandemic started. The survey represents the period between 15 April and 10 May, and was conducted by National Nurses United. It included both union and non-union nurses. Donald Trump has lashed out at China over the Covid-19 pandemic, blaming Beijing for “mass Worldwide killing”. In a tweet, the US president referred to an unidentified “wacko in China,” in the latest of a series of attacks aimed at the country which he appears to be framing as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Trump, who initially played down the seriousness of the threat, later changed course and blamed China for allowing the international spread of coronavirus. The worldwide Covid-19 death toll stands at 323,000. Trump wrote: “Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!” Trump did not specify which statement he was referring to but it follows a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman hitting back after Trump sent a lengthy letter outlining America’s belief that the World Health Organization had not been sufficiently independent of China, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump’s letter as slanderous. “The US leadership’s open letter is … trying to mislead the public … to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,” Zhao said. The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments – including the UK – on disease control. “The question is when and how big, that is the question in my view”, says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job description fresh to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment. Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, is frank in her views in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began. “Looking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges in from the different countries in terms of population immunity – which isn’t all that exciting between 2% and 14%, that leaves still 85% to 90% of the population susceptible – the virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February … I don’t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it’s not the time now to completely relax.” In Hong Kong, where authorities have effectively banned an annual vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre by extending Covid-19 physical distancing measures for another 14 days, people are being urged to instead light candles. Following months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, the 4 June anniversary of the Chinese military’s slaughter of innocent student protesters in 1989 is likely to be particularly poignant. Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong have joined sombre and peaceful candlelit vigils in years gone as part of the world’s biggest commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in Beijing, when Chinese troops opened fire on student-led protesters. But after Hong Kong authorities said on Tuesday that the limit on group gatherings to no more than eight people would be extended at least until 4 June, an organiser is calling for a different approach. Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organises the annual vigils, told Reuters he believed the motive for the extension was “political suppression”. “We have to have a plan B,” Lee said. “Instead of one point, we will do it everywhere, still with the powerful candlelight to condemn the massacre and mourn for those who died in 1989.” Police have still to respond to an application for the vigil to be held in Victoria Park, Lee said, adding that he was not optimistic. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday health measures were not based on political considerations. Hello, readers. This is Simon Murphy now covering the global live blog while my colleague, Damien Gayle, takes a break. The Trump administration has called on the UN to remove references to sexual and reproductive health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan (HRP), writes Liz Ford, deputy editor of the Guardian’s Global development website. In a letter to the UN secretary-general António Guterres on Monday, John Barsa, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development (USAid), called on the UN to “stay focused on life-saving interventions” and not include abortion as an essential service. Barsa’s letter said the plan “unfortunately … does just this, by cynically placing the provision of ‘sexual and reproductive health services’ on the same level of importance as food insecurity, essential health care, malnutrition, shelter, and sanitation”. He highlighted the $650.7m (£530m) USAid had contributed to pandemic funding. It was essential the UN’s response avoided creating controversy, it read. “Therefore, I ask that you remove references to ‘sexual and reproductive health’, and its derivatives from the Global HRP, and drop the provision of abortion as an essential component of the UN’s priorities to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.” New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures revealing the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, writes Richard Partington, the Guardian’s economics correspondent. Warning that there was little evidence of the downturn ending soon as Covid-19 brings the world economy to an effective standstill, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall “precipitously” in the first-half of 2020. The WTO’s quarterly goods trades barometer, which provides real-time information on the trajectory of world merchandise trade relative to recent trends, slumped to 87.6 on a scale where anything below 100 indicates a downturn in activity. Suggesting a sharp contraction in world trade extending into the second-quarter of 2020, the reading was the lowest value on record since the indicator was launched in July 2016. The Netherlands reported thirty-three new deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as 198 more people tested positive for the coronavirus. According to the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM), 44,447 people have so far been diagnosed as infected with the virus, of whom 5,748 have died. There have been 11,627 patients treated in hospital as a result of the outbreak, with 14 new admissions reported by RIVM on Wednesday. Eighty-eight more people have been recorded as dying from Covid-19 in Sweden, bringing the country’s total death toll to 3,831. The latest update from Sweden’s health authority also showed that 724 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus that causes the disease. Sweden has not followed the rest of the world in imposing strict restrictive measures and business closures to contain the spread of the virus. The reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks – and has sparked a race row in the process, writes Morwenna Ferrier, the Guardian’s acting joint fashion editor. Launched over the weekend under the celebrity’s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them. But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of “casual racism”, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment at time of publication. Police in Sri Lanka have arrested more than 60,000 people over the past two months for breaking a curfew imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus, Xinhua reports. A 24-hour curfew has been in force in the capital, Colombo, and its outskirts since 20 March, while the rest of the country is under nighttime curfew. An end date to movement restrictions has not been specified. According to a statement published on Wednesday by the Sri Lankan police, seen by Xinhua, China’s official news agency, 60,425 people had been arrested since the curfew was imposed, for infractions such as loitering on the roads, gathering and consuming alcohol at public grounds, travelling by vehicle on the roads and behaving in an unruly manner while intoxicated. The epidemiology unit of Sri Lanka’s ministry of health on Wednesday reported four new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 1,027. Of those, 584 patients have recovered and 434 were under medical care. Nine people have died from Covid-19. With Greece about to unveil its much-awaited tourism plan, some are gearing up with a gusto for the season, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian’s Athens correspondent. As the country gradually emerges into the post-lockdown age and restrictions are eased, beaches have been opened up. But some bathers - extending the notion of the “new normal” to the sea - are taking no chances. On Mykonos, one swimmer was snapped in masks and gloves as he had a paddle in the waters off the Cycladic isle - which is, like all Greek islands, still mercifully coronavirus-free. Hats off to Ioannis Alexopoulos. In a rare success story Greece has virtually eradicated the virus after enforcing draconian measures to curb the spread of the virus early on. Nigeria’s largest medical union has instructed its health staff in Lagos to end their hospital shifts at 6pm each day, 2-hours before the city-wide curfew, in response to rising reports of police harassment, writes Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian’s West Africa correspondent. There is an 8pm curfew in Lagos under its gradually easing lockdown measures, but in recent days reports have been rife of harassment and abuse by police officers to essential workers, after 8pm. The Nigerian Medical Association president, Dr. Francis Faduyile, told The Guardian that authorities were policing the lockdown curfew indiscriminately. “Yesterday a lot of senior doctors were stopped from going home after hours by police,” he said. “We should be asking them why they are doing this.” “Doctors will stay at home after 6pm to prevent themselves from being embarrassed and molested by police officers,” he added. Lagos’ lockdown curfew exempts essential workers, yet there is insufficient clarity between different agencies on who qualifies. Faduyile said the government needed to clarify to police that health workers were essential. Yesterday videos and pictures showed police in different parts of Nigeria’s most populous city, mounting roadblocks after 8pm for hours before letting commuters go. Security agencies policing the lockdowns in Nigeria have come under scrutiny amid reports of abuses. Lagos is the most affected city in Nigeria’s Covid-19 outbreak, with 2,750 of Nigeria’s 6,400 infections. Cases in the country continue to rise, doubling in just over a fortnight, but test capacity has only marginally improved over that time. Africa’s most populous country has administered just 37,000 tests, “a far cry from what is needed” Faduyile said, and low compared to other African countries. Neighbouring Ghana and South Africa have tested 170,000 and 475,000 respectively. Compounding challenges with the availability of test kits, poor infrastructure had made it hard to distribute its limited supply, and to transport test samples around the country, Faduyile said. More than 90,000 people in Africa have been infected with the coronavirus, according to the latest daily update from the World Health Organization’s regional office for the continent. On Wednesday, Antonio Guterres praised the “brave prevention measures” imposed by African governments to curb the spread of the virus, after a the kind of widespread outbreak predicted across the continent failed to materialise. However there have been consistent criticisms of civil rights abuses, police brutality, and millions left unable to make ends meet. The South Korean football club FC Seoul are facing penalties, including expulsion from their own stadium, for putting sex dolls in empty seats during a match last weekend, according to the Associated Press. The K-League is one of the few football leagues operating during the coronavirus pandemic, with games being played in empty stadiums but FC Seoul’s attempts to increase the atmosphere at Seoul World Cup Stadium backfired after their 1-0 win over Gwangju on Sunday. The club expressed their sincere remorse as a public backlash intensified, but said they were assured by a supplier that they were using mannequins not sex dolls to mimic a home crowd. About 25 mannequins were supplied by a local company and dressed in FC Seoul colours and wearing masks. The Yonhap news agency reported that fans posted suspicions about the life-size dolls on social media during the match and one banner showed the names of an adult toy manufacturer and of models who had inspired those dolls. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus coverage: The global confirmed cases of coronavirus has topped 4.9 million, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally, at least 323,653 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,915,004 are confirmed as having been infected. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Russia passed 300,000. The number, already the second highest in the world, now stands at 308,705, after 8,764 coronavirus infections were reported on Wednesday, but the daily increase was the lowest since 1 May. The Spanish government has confirmed that the wearing of face masks will be compulsory from Thursday in enclosed areas and on streets when the required two-metre social distancing protocols cannot be followed. While children under six will be exempt from the order, masks are recommended for children aged three to five. The aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is to cut at least 9,000 jobs from its global staff of 52,000, due to an anticipated fall in air travel following the coronavirus pandemic. The British company said the job losses would predominantly affect its civil aerospace business, plus its central support functions. UN secretary general António Guterres said that the developed world could learn lessons from African countries’ preventative measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent. Brazil confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Sixteen more people have died from Covid-19 in Bangladesh, as the arrival of what could be the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicates efforts to maintain measures to curb the spread of the disease. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety, officials said, as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. The highest level of alert was raised at 6am, said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management and relief. It came as the latest update from the Bangladesh’s institute of epidemiology, disease control and research (IEDCR), reported that 1,617 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the most in a single day since widespread testing began in the country. So far Bangladesh has recorded 26,738 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 386 deaths from the Covid-19 respiratory disease it can cause. Videos and photos showed people heading to shelters, some carrying bags with their belongings and all wearing masks to protect against coronavirus. Officials went from village to village with loudspeakers warning people to take shelter. In Sathira district, the local chief government administrator, SM Mostafa Kamal, said evacuees were given dry food, baby food and medicine. He said officials were distributing masks and other safety equipment to keep coronavirus from spreading while people stay in thousands of shelters. The cyclone slowed slightly as it reached cooler waters near the coast. But with wind speeds ranging between 160 and 170 km/h, the storm could cause extensive damage: winds and heavy rain battering flimsy houses, a storm surge that may push seawater 25km inland and the possibility of flooding in crowded cities. The cyclone is occurring during the Islamic holy month Ramadan, and reports from Muslim-majority Bangladesh said many villagers were fasting all day Tuesday, then eating at night before heading for the shelters early Wednesday. Iran reported a further 64 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the total death toll in the Islamic republic to 7,183, with 2,735 people in a critical condition in hospital with the disease. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 2,346 more people had tested positive for the virus since Tuesday. Iran has so far counted 126,949 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, of whom 98,808 people had recovered. Jahanpour said that 731,213 tests have so far been carried out in Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. New York faces enormous challenges in its attempts to implement one of the largest contact tracing schemes in the US, as the city prepares to reopen after nearly two months of coronavirus lockdown, writes Miranda Bryant for the Guardian US. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said the state is recruiting an “army of people to trace each person who tested positive” for an “unprecedented, nation-leading contact-tracing programme”. The New York city mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced a new test and trace corps, which he said would “lead the way in creating testing and tracing on a level we’ve never seen before in this city or this country”. Contact tracing is considered to be a key pillar of safely lifting stay-at-home orders, and involves asking Covid-19 patients to recall everyone they have had close contact with while they may have been infectious, and asking those people to quarantine themselves to help prevent the virus from spreading. In countries such as South Korea and Germany, early contact tracing has been credited with successfully minimising outbreaks. But as New York authorities roll out their plans to hire and train thousands of contact tracers, experts warn of the difficulties of pulling it off in the city of 8.6 million in which the pandemic has killed more than 20,000 people. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, an anti-Asian sentiment has been on the rise – and now the fashion community is putting itself at the forefront in tackling the hate, writes Priya Elan, the Guardian’s deputy fashion editor. In the UK, racist incidents have rocketed and hate crimes have increased by 21%, while in the US, there has been an increase in racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans. “The upturn of violence and discrimination really hit way too close to home for all of us,” says the US designer Phillip Lim. “When we see people who look like us, our friends and family members, colleagues being attacked, we can’t be silent.” Lim’s 3.1 Phillip Lim label and Prabal Gurung are among the fashion brands contributing clothing, including T-shirts and hats, with proceeds going to the All Americans Movement, a campaign to help those from marginalised communities who have been affected by Covid-19. “It’s a cross-cultural movement, which reinforces the idea that there are many different ways to be American,” says Gurung, the Nepalese-American fashion designer who is based in New York. “It is an idea: a confluence of different cultures, communities and dreams. When different minority groups stand up and stand together, there is an astounding level of support that can change the tides for a more equitable and peaceful future.” Holidaymakers will be welcomed back to Spain “as soon as possible”, but only when safe to do so, the country’s foreign minister has said, PA Media reports. Foreign minister Arancha González Laya said cities with high concentrations of Covid-19 infection – such as Madrid and Barcelona – remain under stricter rules than more rural areas, but that the country will reopen to visitors at the earliest possible opportunity. González told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We are hoping to get tourists back as soon as possible but we are also conscious that, when we welcome them, we want to provide the safest destination in Europe. We want to make sure when they come they can continue to experience the amazing stay in Spain, whether they love sports or culture or cuisine or simply like our weather. But we want to make sure that at this moment, when every country is suffering from this pandemic, we can provide them with a safe and healthy experience – that’s top of our priorities right now. Lockdown measures in Spain have reflected its high numbers of casualties, with children confined indoors for six weeks between March and the end of April. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 8,000 in Afghanistan, as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive for the second day straight and Kabul recorded its worst day of the crisis, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii for the Guardian in Herat. The health ministry confirmed 492 new cases out of 1,003 tests and 10 deaths from Covid-19 over past 24 hours, raising the total number of infections to 8,145 and death toll to 187. The ministry has pledged to increase number of daily tests. So far, 25,700 suspected patients have been tested. The country received 250 RNA extraction kits from the World Health Organization on Tuesday. Health officials asked the nation to avoid gathering for Eid, which is scheduled for the end of this week, and warned that the Eid gatherings will bring a surge in transmission as the country is yet to reach the peak of the pandemic. Kabul, the capital, recorded its worst day, after 262 of 522 tests came back positive. The city is the country’s worst-affected area by confirmed cases and, despite a government authorised lockdown, streets are still crowded. The northern province of Balkh exceeded Kabul in number of deaths, with three of the latest Covid-19 deaths reported in the province. Balkh has so far recorded 27 deaths and 622 cases. Four of the new deaths were reported in the eastern province of Nangarhar. The western province of Herat recorded 59 new confirmed cases. Afghanistan’s first case of Covid-19 was in Herat, when thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran, the scene of one of the earliest outbreaks outside China, in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The total number of infections in Herat stands at 1,345, with 25 deaths. Parwan province recorded nine new coronavirus cases. At least seven people were killed in the province Tuesday night when “unknown” gunmen stormed a mosque. The northern Takhar province, which was also a battlefield last night, reported 28 new cases. At least nine members of local police force were killed and six were wounded in a clash with the Taliban in Takhar on Tuesday night. War is raging on with full intensity across the country as president Ashraf Ghani, in response to an attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul, ordered resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups. At least eight security forces were killed when Taliban fighters tried to overrun northern province of Kunduz Tuesday. According to the defence ministry more 40 Taliban fighters were also killed in the attack. The UN mission in Afghanistan asked asked warring sides on Tuesday to halt the fighting and to “respect humanitarian law”. Hello, this is Damien Gayle taking on the live blog now, and bringing you the latest in coronavirus-related world news for the next eight hours or so. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions about what we could be covering, please feel free to drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. Thanks everyone, I’m signing off now and handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle. Thanks for reading and for your mails too. Open-air swimming pools in Germany are beginning to reopen from today, as virologists say they are confident the coronavirus will be killed off by chlorine levels in the water. Authorities in the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia have granted the 340 lidos in the region permission to open their doors from today as long as they abide by new hygiene rules that include an online-only booking system and a daily cap of visitors. In Berlin, swimming pools are set to open from 25 May, while other states will follow suit in June. “All existing findings indicate that the virus is certain to be killed off by chlorine”, the German Society for Bathing said in a statement. “Therefore there is no higher risk of infection in swimming pools than in other establishments”. “In indoor and outdoor swimming pools the virus will be killed off by the chlorine”, virologist Jürgen Rissland told regional broadcaster Saarländischer Rundfunk. The risk areas at lidos were therefore not in the water but the adjacent facilities. Berlin is therefore planning to open its outdoor swimming pools without showers and changing rooms, advising visitors to arrive at the pool in their swimwear. Further aiding Spain’s fight against the coronavirus is a new development in Seville: Beer Cart, a robotic arm trained to pull contactless pints. With lockdown measures being applied at a regional level in the country, some parts of Spain have moved to “phase one” of reopening. This includes the capability for bars and cafes to open at reduced capacity and with strict hygiene measures, ideal for robotic staff. Beer Cart has been employed at La Gitana Loca, a bar in Seville, where it has become a local sensation. The bar’s owner, Alberto Martinez, said he had bought the robot before the epidemic took hold, hoping mechanical manpower would increase sales. Because of the crisis, it was never put into use – although he realised it would be perfect in the new environment where people need to stay apart. “We thought it would be ideal for reopening in phase one,” he said. “As the aim is to avoid contact between customers and items (in the bar) … we realised the robot would be good using (disposable) plastic cups to serve beer, so it’s all very self-service.” Even so, the bar is far from making a profit, with only 12 customers allowed at one time on the outdoor terrace. “At the moment, it’s not profitable to open for the few seats we’re allowed. Now that we have to compete with other bars we have to do something different,” he said. “So (with the robot on show) people can see that the bar on the corner is open and that we’re doing something different.” The Spanish government has confirmed that the wearing of face masks will be compulsory from Thursday in enclosed areas and on the streets when the required 2-metre social distancing protocols cannot be followed. While children under six will be exempt from the order, masks are recommended for children aged three to five. People with breathing difficulties are also exempt from using masks. Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies, said the measure was intended to protect both the wearer and those around them. He also said there were clear differences between going for a solitary walk in the countryside and navigating busy city streets. “The rules aren’t that complicated: you need to keep a distance from others of around 2 metres,” he said. “If logically, you’re on the street and realised that won’t be possible, you put on your mask and that’s that.” Until now, face masks – which are being handed out at train and metro stations – have been compulsory only on public transport. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, addressed MPs in congress on Wednesday morning to seek their approval for a fifth, two-week extension of the state-of-emergency that has been in force since 14 March. The prime minister apologised for the mistakes his Socialist-led coalition had made during the pandemic, but said the progress made over the past two months needed to be consolidated with another extension of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. “It is the people who have beaten the curve,” he said. “Spaniards have come together to stop the virus and no one has the right to squander what we’ve achieved with the lockdown.” His arguments were given short shrift by Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party. “You’re trying to get us to choose between you and chaos, but that’s impossible because you are chaos,” said Casado. “You have no way of protecting the Spanish people except with this brutal confinement.” The total number of coronavirus cases in Russia, already the second highest in the world, has passed 300,000. 8,764 new novel coronavirus infections reported on Wednesday took the nationwide total to 308,705. The daily increase was the lowest since 1 May, however. Dr Melita Vujnovich, the WHO’s Russia representative, said she believed the situation in the country had entered a stabilisation phase, the Tass news agency cited her as saying. Only the US has reported more cases than Russia, though the Russian death rate remains much lower than many other countries, something that has been questioned by some critics and relatives of those who have died. Russia says the way it counts deaths is more accurate than others however and has defended its approach. The overall death toll edged up to 2,972 on Wednesday, with 135 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, the country’s coronavirus response centre said. Indonesia reported 693 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise and taking the total number of cases to 19,189, according to the website of Indonesia*s Covid-19 taskforce. There were 21 additional deaths reported, taking the total to 1,242, while 4,575 people have recovered. Indonesia reported its first case of Coronavirus on 2 March. The head of Uefa, European football’s governing body, has given an interview to the Guardian discussing the effect of Covid-19 on the sport. Among the highlights, he suggests live matches with fans will be back “very soon”. How would you describe the current situation and your feelings about it? There’s a lot of work still to be done. I was in Switzerland last week for the first time in two months and had meetings from 9am to 11pm. There is so much information [to take in] and so many calendar issues – and so many millions and millions, dozens of millions of dollars, that we will lose. It is then hard to fall asleep at night. You would be quite irresponsible if you could fall asleep immediately after a day like that. The situation for Uefa is not that alarming, we’re not in a dangerous situation, but we still care about the clubs and the leagues and the stakeholders so it is a lot of work. Would you bet a million dollars that Euro 2020 will be played in 2021? Yes, I would … I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. I don’t think that this virus will last for ever. I think it will [change] sooner than many think. What gives you that impression? It’s a serious situation but it is going down now and we are being more cautious. We know more about the virus and in general I’m an optimistic person. I don’t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave … people you know are likely to die one day, but do we have to be worried today? I don’t think so. We are ready and we will follow the recommendations of the authorities but I’m absolutely sure, personally, that good old football with fans will come back very soon. Police in the Philippines have raided an illegal hospital that had been secretly treating Chinese coronavirus patients. Two people were arrested and one patient was found during the raid on Tuesday at a residential villa that had been turned into a hospital with seven beds and its own chemists, authorities said. More than 200 suspected coronavirus rapid test kits and syringes were recovered from the villa, which was in the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone on the site of a former American air base. At the entrance to the building was a small canteen with stacks of beer cases and a red sign welcoming visitors with well wishes in Chinese. The Chinese male patient was moved to a legal hospital. Those arrested were the Chinese administrator of the illegal hospital, which may have been operating secretly for about three months, and a compatriot who manned the drugstore. Police told the Associated Press that the patients were likely to have come from a large number of Chinese nationals working for online gambling companies in the area. The Philippines, backed by the Chinese government, has launched a crackdown on Chinese citizens who enter the country as tourists and then work for gambling operations, which are illegal in China. The patients are believed to have avoided visiting public hospitals for fear of being arrested. The Philippines has reported nearly 13,000 coronavirus infections, including 837 deaths, among the highest in south-east Asia. China will have to ‘rapidly activate domestic demand’, according to the country’s minister for industry, as the coronavirus cuts into global trade. The communist state has been for decades been the world’s factory, manufacturing much of its goods, but despite a recent rebound the effects of the pandemic has cut into China’s ability to sell. The Chinese minister for industry and information technology, Miao Wei told a news conference on Wednesday that “although our imports and exports in renminbi terms from January to April have increased moderately, I think that if the global pandemic cannot come under effective control, this is unsustainable”. To drive economic growth, the country will “rapidly activate domestic demand” to make up for weakness in the international markets, he said. China had already been trying to boost consumption as a key driver of domestic growth in a drive to recalibrate the economy from one driven by exports and state investment. The aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is to cut at least 9,000 jobs from its global staff of 52,000, due to an anticipated fall in air travel following the coronavirus pandemic. The British company, which supplies engines for large aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, said the job losses would predominantly affect its civil aerospace business, plus its central support functions. Air travel has slumped since March because of travel restrictions and future flight schedules may not return to their previous peak, hurting Rolls-Royce, which earns revenues from the number of hours its engines fly. The total number of Covid-19 cases worldwide has passed 4.9m, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The latest figures show 4,900,253 global cases and 323,341 deaths. The US continues to show the most cases, with nearly a third of the global total at 1,528,566 and 91,921 deaths. The International Energy Agency has warned that countries must redouble their efforts to increase renewable energy supply as the world recovers from the coronavirus crisis. The agency predicts that renewables are set to see a drop in growth for the first time in two decades following the pandemic. While capacity within the power sector is expected to continue to grow, the use of renewables in transport will likely fall due to a drop in travel and the crash in the price of oil. The agency, which had expected 2020 to be a marquee year for green energy, cut its two-year forecast for growth in renewable capacity by nearly 10%t. “Putting emissions into a structural decline needed renewables to grow much faster across all sectors even before the Covid-19 crisis,” the IEA said in an updated forecast. “To regain and exceed the growth rates seen in the years before the pandemic, policymakers need to put clean energy – including renewables and energy efficiency – at the centre of recovery efforts.” Revising downwards a prediction made in October, the IEA now expects 167GW of renewable capacity to become operational this year – a decline of 13% from 2019 and the first downward trend since 2000. However, this will still add 6% to the global renewable capacity total this year – more than the combined size of power systems in both North America and Europe – with solar and wind accounting for the vast majority of new installations. Hallo there, this is Paul MacInnes and I’m taking over from Helen for the next four hours. Any questions or tips feel free to email me: paul.macinnes@theguardian.com That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thank you for following along – and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a ‘badge of honour’. The US president told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.” He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call. A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state’s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. UN chief praises Africa’s efforts to stem virus. UN secretary general António Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is ‘Trump enemy statement’. Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a “Trump enemy statement”. “If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,” Trump said. “They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.” There have only been limited studies on the drug in relation to Covid-19 so far. New Zealand PM flags four-day working week. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. High schools open in South Korea. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. China gears up for annual congress. China’s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy. WHO assembly passes a resolution to investigate global pandemic response. Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. None of the WHO’s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The resolution backs the WHO’s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to deny and delay refunds for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to new research from a UK consumer group. The latest consumer insight tracker from Which? reveals that trust in airlines and holiday companies has slumped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to -12 in May 2020, a fall of 21 points and the lowest in the seven years of collecting the data. Global report: Brazil’s deadliest day as Trump calls US cases a ‘badge of honour’ Brazil has seen its most deadly day since the coronavirus outbreak began, prompting Donald Trump to consider a ban on travel to the US from Brazil as he declared the huge number of US cases of coronavirus was “a badge of honour”. After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday at the White House, Trump said: “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either,” in relation to Brazil. When asked if about the possibility of a travel ban, the president said he was considering it and went on to say he saw the large number of US cases as a “badge of honour”. The US has by far the highest number of cases in the world, at more than 1.5 million with nearly 92,000 deaths, followed by Russia and then Brazil, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. The death toll in Brazil reached a total of 17,971 on Tuesday, after a record 1,179 people died in one day. The highest daily toll before Tuesday had been 881 deaths, on 12 May. More than 85% of intensive care beds are full in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state’s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely. Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. “For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s supreme court said in response to Reuters’ questions, citing restrictions imposed to minimise virus spread. It was the first criminal case where a death sentence has been pronounced by remote hearing in Singapore, the spokesperson added. Genasan’s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client received the judge’s verdict on a Zoom call and is considering an appeal. The global growth of renewable energy will slow for the first time in 20 years due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which will “hurt but not halt” the rise of clean energy. The world’s energy watchdog has warned that developers will build fewer wind farms and solar energy projects this year compared with a record roll out of renewables in 2019. But a rebound is possible in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if critical government decisions made within the next few months support a green economic recovery from the pandemic. New figures from the IEA predict that the world will grow its capacity of renewable energy by 6% or 167 GW this year. The forecast growth is 13% less than the amount of new capacity which started up in 2019. The slowdown is likely to be more severe in Europe. The IEA expects the amount of new renewable energy rolling out this year to fall by a third to its lowest annual growth rate since 1996. Contact tracers lack knowledge about Covid-19 job They were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the “rigorous” and “detailed” instruction needed for such an important role – but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits. People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles. New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the Guardian. When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic. UK plans for contact-tracing in doubt as app not ready until June The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh, Frances Perraudin, Heather Stewart and Peter Walker report: Plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty as it emerged that a mobile tracking app will not be ready until June. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the app would be “rolling out in mid May” across England, but on Tuesday ministerial sources tried to downplay a system considered critical to control the disease as the country emerges from lockdown. It came as the deputy chief scientific adviser acknowledged the decision to abandon track-and-trace in March was made because of a lack of testing capacity, but said it was “the right thing to do” in the circumstances. Prof Angela McLean told the No 10 press briefing: “The advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available. It was what was the best thing to do with the tests that we had. We could not have people in hospital with Covid symptoms not knowing whether or not they had Covid.” Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis in decades, as well as a coronavirus lockdown. Some Lebanese families have started paying their home help in the depreciating local currency, while others are now unable to pay them at all, with increasing reports of domestic workers being thrown into the street, AFP reports. Lebanon is to start repatriation flights from its closed airport on Wednesday, at first for Ethiopians and mostly male migrants from Egypt. Outside the Ethiopian consulate in Beirut on Monday, dozens of Ethiopian women and Lebanese employers tried to secure seats on Wednesday’s flight. But Lebanese security forces turned them away at the door, telling them to return in nine days and employers that they would have to pay for the flight. An estimated 250,000 domestic workers live in Lebanon, the large majority Ethiopian, many in conditions condemned by rights groups. A sponsorship system known as “kafala” excludes maids, nannies and carers from Lebanon’s labour law, and leaves them at the mercy of their employers, who pay wages as low as $150 a month. With staff obtained at high fees from recruitment agencies even before being paid wages, and unhappy workers unable to resign without their employer’s permission, some have likened the system to slavery. Activists say calls for help have increased in recent weeks, especially as live-in workers have been in lockdown with families. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: “That was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration” . Trump also said the US having the highest cases worldwide is a ‘badge of honour’. The US President told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most.Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.”He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” UN chief praises Africa’s efforts to stem virus.

Jacinda Ardern flags four-day working week as way to rebuild country. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues.In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. High schools open in South Korea. South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time this year, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The United Arab Emirates flew its first publicly announced flight to Israel on Tuesday when Etihad Airways sent medical supplies to help the Palestinians cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Except for Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries have no official relations with Israel but Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and the Jewish state have been warming ties recently amid shared concern over Iran. California’s undocumented relief fund sees chaotic start. Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. South Africa eased its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country’s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country’s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s chancellor, said the country is facing “a severe recession the likes of which we haven’t seen”. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no “face-to-face lectures” at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country’s worst day of the crisis – the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. China’s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy, AFP reports. The 3,000 members of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s legislature, will gather in Beijing this week. The annual gatherings have been occasions for the Communist Party to tout its achievements, set the country’s economic agenda and consolidate Xi’s power. But this year’s congress comes on the back of the biggest challenge of Xi’s political life, with a virus that has killed thousands of people, paralysed the world’s second-biggest economy and sparked a bout of online criticism of the government. The Communist Party put off the “Two Sessions”, originally scheduled for March, for the first time since the Cultural Revolution as the country battled the coronavirus, which surfaced in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Since then, China’s official case numbers have dwindled even as millions were infected abroad, with Beijing now positioning itself as a success story and potential saviour for the world, offering billions of dollars in aid to fight the virus. But the atmosphere will continue to be “solemn and tense” amid fears of new infections, Gu Su, a professor of law and philosophy at Nanjing University, said. The congress is expected to span seven days this year instead of the usual two weeks, state media reported. Lights, camera, no action: Thai films banned from shooting love scenes during Covid-19 Thailand’s film industry has been instructed not to shoot any love scenes, fighting or acts that involve close contact, to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. As officials continued to relax lockdown measures across Thailand, production companies were told to adapt their work to comply with social distancing rules. Under guidance issued by Yupha Thawiwattanakit Bowon, deputy permanent secretary of culture, filmmakers must work in well-ventilated spaces, with no more than 50 crew members present. Special effects and camera angles can be used to help depict scenes that would usually require intimacy or contact, and all people off-camera must wear a mask. The US President told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.” He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” The US has 1,527,895 cases. The country with the next-highest number of cases is Russia, with 299,941. Trump added: “So I view it as a badge of honour. Really, it’s a badge of honour. It’s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.” The US also has the highest number of deaths worldwide, with 91,921. The next worst official death toll, in the UK, is 35,422, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The US testing rates are high, but not the highest worldwide. Its total tests per 1,000 people are the fourteenth-highest worldwide, according to Our World in Data. Sweden has taken a soft approach to virus restrictions and although its rules are likely to be in place longer than in other countries, officials are adamant their strategy is a winner in the long term, AFP reports. “This fight against Covid-19 is a marathon,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said recently, adding that his officials “strongly believe” their measures are viable for the long haul. While people in other European countries have gradually begun returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, Swedes have been strongly advised to continue working from home, and possibly not just for weeks, but for months to come. However, Sweden never imposed full lockdown measures – under-16s have continued to go to school, patrons have not been stopped from going to cafes, bars and restaurants. Sweden has 30,799 confirmed cases and a death toll of 3,743. Some have accused Sweden of playing Russian roulette with citizens’ lives by allowing the virus to circulate slowly in society, with the main goal being to ensure the public healthcare system can keep pace. The consequences are difficult to miss - Sweden’s death rate stood at 371 per million inhabitants on Tuesday, roughly eight times the rate in Norway and Finland, according to the Worldometer website. However, although Sweden’s hospitals have reported strained conditions, they have not been overwhelmed. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 797 to 176,007, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 83 to 8,090, the tally showed. Australians in the country’s most populous state will be able to vacation within its borders next month, when art galleries and museums will also reopen, as officials seek to boost an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The move will allow New South Wales state, home to Sydney, to open up tourist regions on its southern coast that were badly damaged by huge bushfires before the virus wreaked further havoc. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people would still need to adapt to a “new normal” as officials maintain some of the social distancing measures that have been credited with keeping both Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low. Australia has reported just over 7,000 infections, including 100 deaths, among its population of 25 million. NSW, the hardest hit state, logged just four new cases over the past 24 hours, all international travellers already in quarantine. More than 7,000 test results over the same period showed no community transmission, Berejiklian said. There are almost 4.9 million cases of coronavirus globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with 4,897,492 currently confirmed. The current number of deaths is 323,285. Both cases and deaths are likely to be higher due to differing testing rates and underreporting. The 15 worst-affected countries in terms of cases are: US: 1,527,895 Russia: 299,941 Brazil: 271,885 United Kingdom: 250,138 Spain: 232,037 Italy: 226,699 France: 180,933 Germany: 177,778 Turkey: 151,615 Iran: 124,603 India: 106,475 Peru: 99,483 China: 84,063 Canada: 80,493 Saudi Arabia: 59,854 Venezuela imposed new curfews in a handful of towns along its borders with Colombia and Brazil in response to a jump in coronavirus cases which officials attributed mainly to returning migrants, Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Tuesday. In a state television address, Rodriguez said the South American country had detected 131 new cases in the past 24 hours, the most it has registered in a single day to date. He said that included 110 people who had contracted the virus abroad, bringing the total to 749, with 10 deaths. Millions of Venezuelans have emigrated in recent years due to an economic breakdown and humanitarian crisis, with many settling in nearby Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. But with lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus in those countries now hurting their economies, thousands have returned. Migrants returning to Venezuela are required to spend a 14-day quarantine period at shelters at the border, rather than in their home states. Venezuela has so far registered far fewer coronavirus cases than most major Latin American countries, but the daily case count has grown at a brisk rate in each of the last four days. Hospital workers warn that their facilities are unprepared for a major outbreak after years of underfunding South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time this year, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. The beginning of the spring semester has been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online. But with daily coronavirus cases sharply down since a February peak, teachers with thermometers and hand sanitisers welcomed seniors in masks at their high schools on Wednesday. Under new health guidelines for schools, students and teachers must wear masks except at mealtimes, and are asked to wipe down their desks. Windows will be open to improve air-flow, and desks spaced 1 metre (3 feet) apart. Starting with high school seniors, schools will reopen in stages between 20 May and 1 June for all 5.5 million elementary, middle and high school students. Share your experiences: how do you think New Zealand should change after Covid-19? A week into New Zealand’s loosened lockdown laws and the country is beginning to return to a semblance of normality. Office workers are up early heading out for their commute in smart clothes, while children are lugging around schoolbags full of homework, and hairdressers are heaving with colours, cuts and trims. Has anything changed, and what changes should stick? During lockdown it seemed that New Zealand would collapse and be rebuilt after the pandemic. Many workers found they were unexpectedly productive at home, and relished ditching the expensive and climate-destroying commute, while many children enjoyed learning in less structured ways. Many families spent more time together, dogs were walked excessively, and home-cooking become the latest fashion. Get in touch on the form here: New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent work/life balance issues. In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals. The prime minister’s informal comments have excited New Zealanders, many of whom are questioning whether seismic, systemic change will result from the pandemic – or whether life will return to normal; with its associated problems. Speaking from Rotorua, one of the country’s tourist hubs, Ardern said many New Zealanders said they would travel more domestically if they had more flexibility in their working lives. The country’s tourism market has taken a massive downturn after the pandemic, with all borders remaining closed to foreign nationals and many New Zealanders taking pay-cuts or tightening their belt in case of lay-offs. “I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day workweek. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I’ve said there’s just so much we’ve learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,” Ardern said. The United Arab Emirates flew its first publicly announced flight to Israel on Tuesday when Etihad Airways sent medical supplies to help the Palestinians cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Except for Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries have no official relations with Israel but Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and the Jewish state have been warming ties recently amid shared concern over Iran. “Etihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,” an Etihad spokesperson said. “The flight had no passengers on board.” The official UAE news agency WAM said the flight involved the delivery of 14 tonnes of urgent medical supplies that “will support the efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and its impact in the occupied Palestinian territory”. Israel controls access to the Palestinian territories. The Etihad delivery was described as part of broader humanitarian efforts. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. “Covid-19 has made much slower progress [in Africa] than the predictions that were made at the beginning” of the crisis, Guterres said in an interview with RFL radio in France. This has been largely thanks to the fact that “most African governments and organisations took in time very brave prevention measures which provide a lesson for some developed nations that did not,” he added. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide. Podcast: The scientific race to understand Covid-19 In the five months since the world learned about Covid-19, it has killed hundreds of thousands of people. In that time, what have scientists found out – and what do they still not know? Coronavirus cases and deaths over time: how countries compare around the world The Guardian’s Nick Evershed and Trent Nixon have created handy this handy set of epidemic curves for most countries, based on data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and compiled by Our World in Data. It shows, approximately, which countries have managed to suppress the virus, which countries are only now being hit badly, and which countries are experiencing a second wave of infections: Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. Adding to already overwhelmed telephone systems, the state issued last-minute directives that said callers needed to reach a live person in order to apply for aid. Nonprofits across the state selected to distribute the money reported huge demand as people rushed to secure a spot for the first-come, first-served program. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or Chirla, one of 12 nonprofits tapped by the state to distribute the funds, received more than 1.1m phone calls on day one of the program – 630,000 calls just within the first 90 minutes of opening the hotline. Rare UK wildlife thriving in lockdown, reveals UK’s National Trust First came the goats. During the first days of lockdown the bearded, ghostly white creatures wandered down from their north Wales clifftop home into the town of Llandudno and made headlines around the globe. Now the National Trust is reporting that emboldened wildlife, from raptors and warblers to badgers, otters and even orcas, appear to be enjoying the disappearance of humans from its gardens, castles and waterways across the UK. The charity is asking people to be aware that when they eventually return to the countryside they should take care not to disturb wildlife they would not usually expect to encounter. Reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset, English partridges rootling around an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley Park in west London, having not been heard there for 20 years. ‘We do not feel safe’: Samoan seafarers plead for right to return home Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson reports for the Guardian: Samoans trapped at sea due to coronavirus have pleaded with their government to allow them to return home. The 321 Samoan seafarers working on commercial and cruise ships around the world have been told by their government to be patient, since Samoa closed its borders in March to all travellers including returning citizens. Thirty-five of the seafarers whose contracts ended at the beginning of the pandemic are concerned for their families as their sources of income have stopped. Twelve of them are stranded on MSC Armonia, a cruise ship moored off the coast of the Bahamas. Jorge Contesse, law professor and director of the Center for Transnational Law, Rutgers University said the seafarers had the right to return to their home country and were protected under the 2006 maritime labour convention (MLC). “Under this convention seafarers are entitled to be repatriated at no cost to themselves.” Samoa ratified the convention in 2013. Contesse said: “Samoa has a duty to protect its citizens and therefore it should activate diplomatic communications and legal proceedings if necessary.” The Pan-American Health Organization said Tuesday that Nicaragua’s government has denied its personnel access to the nation’s hospitals despite having offered access, a move adding to the widespread belief President Daniel Ortega is trying to underplay the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. Up to this week, Nicaragua had reported only 25 confirmed Covid-19 cases and eight related deaths. Those numbers became more difficult to defend as more Nicaraguans spoke out about the deaths of their relatives and reports mounted of near-clandestine burials. On Tuesday, Nicaragua’s Health Ministry suddenly increased the case count tenfold, to 254, and said the number of deaths had grown to 17. But there is evidence suggesting that might still be a vast under-count. Victims’ relatives claim that some cases are simply listed as atypical pneumonia or respiratory failure. On Monday, Ortega acknowledged that some of the 309 cases of people who have died of pneumonia since January might have involved Covid-19. Interestingly, on May 3 the health ministry had reported only 86 pneumonia deaths so far this year, suggesting there were 223 such deaths between 3 May and 15 May. Ortega’s government has not implemented social distancing measures used elsewhere and continues to promote mass gatherings. Schools remain open and professional sporting events still draw fans. A registry of death certificates in Mexico City suggests there were 4,577 cases where doctors mentioned coronavirus or Covid-19 as a possible or probable cause of death, more than three times the official death toll in the city, AP reports. The federal government acknowledges only 1,332 confirmed deaths in Mexico City since the pandemic began, less than a third as many as the investigation revealed. The anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption said in a report Monday that it got access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between 18 March and 12 May. It showed that in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 death certificates, doctors included the words SARS, COV2, COV, Covid 19, or new coronavirus. The virus’ technical name is SARS-CoV-2. The notes the group counted included terms like suspected, “probable, or possible role of the virus in the deaths. In 3,209 of the certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. Only 323 certificates list confirmed coronavirus as a cause of death; 1,045 other death certificates listed Covid-19 but didn’t specify if it was suspected or confirmed. The group did not say how it accessed the database, which was kept by local courts. But it noted that official counts showed only 1,060 coronavirus deaths during that 18 March-12 May period. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has acknowledged there are more deaths than have officially been reported, and has said a special team of epidemiologists will review the death figures. US births continued to fall last year, leading to the fewest number of newborns in 35 years, AP reports. The decline is the latest sign of a prolonged national baby bust that’s been going on for more than a decade. And some experts believe the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy will suppress the numbers further. Experts say there are a number of causes, but chief among them are shifting attitudes about motherhood: Many women and couples delay childbearing and have fewer kids once they start. The economy is a factor, because many jobs are low-paying and unstable, and that coupled with high rents and other factors have caused women and couples to be much more cautious about having kids, said John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health. Santelli said it’s possible births will go up this year, at least among some groups. Access to birth control and abortion has become more difficult, and some homebound couples may find themselves with greater opportunity to conceive, he said. But others say it’s more likely births will plummet. The idea that there will be a lot of coronababies is widely is widely perceived as a myth, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania fertility researcher. The debate most demographers are having is not about whether there will be a decline, but whether it will be lasting, he said. The decline due to Covid-19 might be different given the extent and severity of the crisis, and the long-lasting uncertainty that is caused by it, Kohler wrote in an email. Video: The US president has defended his use of the anti-malaria drug, dismissing a study indicating it was not an effective coronavirus treatment as a ‘Trump enemy statement’. He also attacked Nancy Pelosi after she publicly expressed concern, claiming she had ‘mental problems’: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says that his interim health minister will on Wednesday sign a new chloroquine protocol, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro said his own mother is 93 and he keeps a box of chloroquine in case she needs it. He also said that he saw Trump say he was taking chloroquine. Interim health minister General Eduardo Pazuello would stay on for the time being, Bolsonaro said. Last week, my colleague Dom Phillips reported, Brazil’s health minister abruptly resigned after less than a month on the job. Teich was Brazil’s second health minister to leave office in less than a month. In the weeks leading up to the resignation Teich had increasingly disagreed with Bolsonaro over social isolation and the use of the malaria drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus. The Brazilian president has enthusiastically backed using the drug, despite a string of medical studies showing that it has no positive effect on people suffering Covid-19, and can possibly cause other health complications. More on the resignation last week below: In case you missed it: beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in an alarming sign that the pandemic may be only at the start of its destructive march through the region. More than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile’s capital, Santiago, whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths, AP reports. In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world’s 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000.“Were in bad shape,” said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peruvian governments Covid-19 task force. “This is war.” In some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn’t get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren’t as busy running the risk of spreading the disease further. A month after swamping the Ecuadorian coastal city of Guayaquil in one of the first serious blows to Latin America, Covid-19 is sickening thousands in the capital of Quito, where 80% of intensive care beds were occupied as of Friday. In terms of intensive care, we’re stripped bare,” city health secretary Lenín Mantilla said. In Mexico, intensive care occupancy is below 50% in most cities, although deaths have begun to overwhelm funeral homes and crematoriums in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said.In the latest apocalyptic prediction by a member of the global financial elite, David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Malpass said that the World Bank group had so far loaned money for emergency programmes in 100 countries, accounting for about 70% of the world’s population, in response to the crisis. He said the money would “reinforce healthcare systems” as well as pay for medical equipment and supplies.According to a transcript of his speech on the World Bank website, he said: The health and economic impacts that the Covid-19 pandemic and shut down have inflicted on developing countries are severe. Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty – that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years. And our forecasts indicate deep recession this year as much as minus five percent recession for the global economy. Families have lost loved ones, millions of jobs and livelihoods are lost, the health systems are under enormous strain worldwide. In the UK, thousands of people with cancer could die early because so many hospitals have suspended surgery for the disease while the NHS battles the coronavirus, experts warn today. The pandemic will have “a terrible indirect impact on the lives of cancer patients” for months to come, on top of the devastation for families who have lost a loved one to Covid-19, according to research by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). The authors say that the disruption to NHS cancer treatment, and especially delays to operations to remove tumours, will lead directly to some people’s disease having become incurable. Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. This week Brazil overtook the United Kingdom to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections, amid warnings from its former health minister that three painful months lie ahead. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Brazil accounts for more cases than any other country in Latin America, which has seen 480,000-plus cases and 31,000 dead. Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has snubbed physical distancing rules and has called for gyms, hair salons and other businesses to reopen. Hello and welcome to today’s global live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest news from around the world for the next few hours. Please do get in touch with any comments, questions, tips, stories or jokes on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. The World Bank estimates that 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty, World Bank chief David Malpass said in a speech, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Meanwhile Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed death toll passes 322,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 322,457 people are known to have died while at least 4,881,619 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting. Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: “That was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration” . The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world’s population. The World Health Organization’s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO’s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. South Africa eased its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country’s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country’s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s chancellor, said the country is facing “a severe recession the likes of which we haven’t seen”. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no “face-to-face lectures” at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country’s worst day of the crisis – the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country. The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third holiest site, will reopen next week, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March. People living within a kilometre of Barcelona’s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make “recreational use” of the Catalan capital’s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19 in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T17:45:12Z","webTitle":"Solar power in crisis: 'My panels generate enough power for two loads of washing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"Solar power in crisis: 'My panels generate enough power for two loads of washing'","bodyText":"Sit back, relax, and read this story with an untroubled conscience: it has been created on a laptop and mobile phone powered entirely by the rays of the sun. This feat would surely astound the most idealistic Greek philosopher or Victorian entrepreneur. It would confirm their wildest hopes for humanity’s progress. Perhaps they would be even more amazed that it was possible via a coalition of Chinese companies, British roofers and local councils. Oh, and government support, which is set to be abruptly withdrawn. The power comes from 16 black Ja solar panels that were fitted to the roof of my home in August. Together, these panels, each the size of a coffee tabletop, have a capacity of 4kW, enough to meet the energy needs of an average family home. Today, a gloomy autumnal moment, they have generated 4.403kWh. It hardly sounds impressive – it’s enough power for a couple of loads of washing – but collectively it represents a revolution. Solar hasn’t changed my life, but it has shifted my perceptions. A little monitor on my desk tells me how much electricity I am generating. I’m acutely aware of the scarcity of energy, the rarity of unbroken sunshine and changing path of the sun. In August, rays hit my panels at 8.30am and an image of a green finger materialised on my monitor, urging me to switch on appliances. Now it doesn’t appear until 10.30am and so we delay putting on the washing machine. We have toddlers around the house all day, so solar suits us: we time the dishwasher for daylight hours and the TV tends to be on more during the day than at night. If I’m working from home, I charge laptops and phones around midday, too. Solar’s drawback is that most power is generated in daylight hours, when people tend to be at work, and there’s currently no affordable battery technology to store the energy you generate. But that energy is not wasted: it goes into the national grid, and solar owners are paid for what they produce. A million British homes now have rooftop solar panels. The thicker panels are solar thermal and heat water. Most, some 750,000 solar PV installations, convert the sun into electricity. Solar produces 1.5% of total UK electricity, up from virtually nothing in 2010. It has proved so popular that the government wants to cut the feed-in tariff, the solar subsidy, by 87%. Since 2010, domestic and commercial solar systems have been paid by the government for every kWh they generate. I receive quarterly payments for the electricity I generate at 12.96p per kWh with another smaller payment for what the authorities estimate I return to the grid. These payments are guaranteed for 20 years. Such has been the popularity of solar that the government says it is spending too much money supporting it: from January, it is proposing to dramatically slash this subsidy for new solar installations. The Solar Trade Association has warned this could cost up to 27,000 jobs; 1,000 are already disappearing with the recent closure of four big renewable companies. Will this solar miracle be shattered? Will rooftop panels soon resemble the relics of a bygone energy age, like the enormous cooling towers of coal-fired power stations? Like many people, I was persuaded to put up solar PV not by promises of a fat cheque from the government but by meeting someone who’d had panels fitted and sung their praises. In 2014, I was researching a story about REPOWERBalcombe, a community energy group created by members of the Sussex village best known for its anti-fracking protests. Tom Parker, a gardener, had panels fitted on his roof five years earlier and then volunteered to help 15 renewable projects in the neighbourhood, including his children’s school. He had watched solar systems over 20 years’ worth of running time – and none had lost a single hour of power generation. “It’s fantastically reliable, much more reliable than the National Grid,” he enthused. “It’s just churning out energy, year after year.” Last year, I moved to a south-facing house and this summer found a good deal for solar PV: my standard 16 panels cost £4,630 to supply and install, which was done in a day in August by an electrician and two roofers who were recent converts to solar employment. Business was brisk: they were supposed to fit two roofs each day. Business is even brisker now. Britain’s solar providers are swamped with work as people rush to get panels installed before the government introduces its planned subsidy cut. After that, with solar still a few years off “grid parity” – where a unit of solar power is as cheap as electricity produced via gas, coal or other fossil fuels – the industry will rapidly burn out. According to the Solar Trade Association, the proposed cuts will leave Britain with an annual solar spend of less than what Buckinghamshire county council is devoting to potholes this year. I claim I would have fitted the panels without a subsidy because I want to reduce my dependence on fossil fuels; for others, solar PV is a pragmatic investment: at current prices, government subsidies and reduced electricity bills return your £5,000 in about eight years; then the subsidy – and lower bills – keep coming for the 20-year lifespan of the panels. Most experts say the panels will last longer. I have not yet noticed a rapid drop in my electricity bill, but reductions in southern England are estimated at £135 a year. If I was truly principled, perhaps I wouldn’t pocket the subsidy, but a solar meter was installed next to my electricity meter and I registered for the feed-in tariff through my energy provider. When the feed-in tariff began, in 2010, domestic early adopters were paid a whopping 43p per kWh. But they also forked out almost three times as much for their panels. My magic monitor informs me of the sun’s riches each day. My worst day so far – torrential rain – provided just 7p; the last £2 day was a month ago; will I see its like again before spring? Nevertheless, my solar is on track to generate the fitters’ predicted 3,485kWh each year, which is more than my household’s annual electricity consumption. If so, the feed-in tariff will pay me £534.77 tax-free, each year. The solar subsidy currently costs every energy billpayer £9 each year. This is the nub of the case against solar: why should poor billpayers pay for relatively affluent people like me to indulge our “green crap”? The government’s motives for cutting the subsidy were explained more pragmatically by the contractor who measured up for my panels, an old-school property surveyor who had moved into PV. The government looks like it is struggling to meet its legally binding target of renewables providing 15% of UK energy (including heating) by 2020 but such is the dramatic expansion of solar that it doesn’t want to pay millions in subsidies that cause it to exceed this target. So it is sensible to gradually reduce solar subsidy as panel costs fall: people will continue to fit solar and the industry will prosper and eventually be weaned off government support: the Solar Trade Association is begging the government to adopt an “emergency” plan to do just this. It claims it will add just £1 to annual energy bills. When I call Leo Murray, he’s standing by a fake sun – a 10ft helium balloon filled with LED lights in Ravenscourt Park, London. The campaigns director for 10:10, a charity encouraging positive action on climate change, Murray’s lightbulb-like brightness is dimmed by the government’s desire to slash solar support. Who wouldn’t want to exceed our renewables targets, he wonders, when surveys show that solar is the most popular form of energy, with 80% support: “We explain to the public how we all contribute towards solar – it adds a couple of quid on our bills each year – and we can’t find anyone who is anti-renewable energy.” Murray believes the government is tackling the success of solar the wrong way round. It allocated a finite sum of money and now that is almost spent, after the quicker-than-forecast uptake of solar panels, it is pulling the plug. “It’s ideologically driven. It’s coming from the Treasury. You see the looks on DECC [Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change] officials’ faces – they don’t want to be doing this. It’s the most successful and popular climate-change policy ever implemented by the UK government – a demand-led energy policy engaging consumers in the transition to a low-energy economy.” But why should hard-pressed billpayers subsidise expensive solar? “What really gives the lie to that argument is Hinkley [the proposed new nuclear power station]. Even staunch supporters of nuclear don’t think that is a good deal. At £24.5bn, it could be the most expensive object on earth. If you want to keep bills down, don’t do that – it’s definitely going to push bills up.” For Murray, there’s a simple way to ensure wealthy solar investors aren’t subsidised by less affluent billpayers: a solar levy could be progressively applied to bigger electricity bills. (There is a strong correlation between higher bills and higher household wealth, and there could be specific support for exceptions, such as low-income residents of energy-inefficient private rentals.) Murray and 10:10 will continue to support volunteers in community energy. While media coverage has focused on commercial job losses, the solar cuts will also decimate community energy. Since I met Tom Parker in 2014, REPOWERBalcombe has gone from strength to strength. Funded by local people, Parker and his fellow volunteers have opened an 18kW array on a local farm and two smaller rooftop solar systems for schools. The Conservative-dominated local council this month approved their plans for a 4.8MW array which will meet all the power needs for Balcombe and neighbouring West Hoathly. But Parker is despairing at the government’s punitive approach to solar. “We demonstrated that the community hated the idea of fracking and loved the idea of solar and they are trying to prevent other communities from taking the same approach. It’s almost like we’ve been too successful.” It’s not simply the subsidy cut: Parker lists eight major regulatory changes that have made it more difficult for community energy groups. These include making it harder for investors to obtain tax relief, changing the rules over the creation of energy co-ops and making renewable projects such as theirs pay a “climate change levy” – even though they are part of the solution, not the problem. “If someone had set out a year ago to say, ‘How can we most damage co-ops?’, I don’t think they could’ve done any more,” says Parker. As Murray puts it: “These people are volunteers, doing their best to get things off the ground and the ground keeps moving underneath them.” REPOWERBalcombe won’t be able to grow any more, but it’s lucky to have established as many projects as it has, says Parker. Elsewhere, “it’s looking pretty dire for community energy,” admits Murray. “It won’t kill the sector dead but we won’t see any new projects coming forward.” The volunteers running community energy groups normally aspire to expand to a point where they can employ one person to run their project over its 20-year lifespan. The cuts create the prospect of volunteers being forced to manage their groups (committed to paying a return to local people who have invested in them) for 20 years themselves, unable to expand to hand over to a modestly paid professional. “That’s vindictive,” says Murray. “Presumably, it’s not meant to be.” A botched cut in solar support may damage UK PLC, with investors fleeing such an unstable regulatory environment, as the CBI has argued, but it won’t trouble global trends. Solar currently produces 200 gigawatts around the world. Forecasts suggest this will be 1,000 in 10 years’ time but predictions, admits Ajay Gambhir, senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, have been far too pessimistic. Early 21st-century forecasts of a “US$1 per watt” price for solar panels by 2030 were reached in 2011/12. “That is a rapid cost reduction,” says Gambhir. Solar is a modular technology, so manufacturers quickly learn how to refine it when repeatedly making the same component. Chinese manufacturers will reduce costs to 35/40 cents per watt by the decade’s end, predicts Gambhir, confidently. And solar will probably be adopted in developing nations as quickly as the mobile phone in Africa: its modular character is ideal for remote countries with a limited electricity grid. More exciting than ever-cheaper panels is affordable battery technology, which will solve my problem of generating lots of power at midday when I don’t really need it. Elon Musk of Tesla unveiled its Powerwall domestic battery to great fanfare this spring. In Britain, Powervault is selling dishwasher-sized rechargeable battery units for domestic solar for £2,800. “There’s been a lot of interest from early adopters who’d like to use more of the solar energy they generate,” says Joe Warren, managing director of Powervault. He predicts that prices could fall to £1,000 by 2020 with 50,000 UK households buying batteries. It is not just makers who are talking up batteries. As Gambhir explains, increasing the amount of electricity storage has huge value to the National Grid because it helps balance variable supply and erratic demand (we all switch on the kettles during the World Cup final half-time). It also reduces the requirement to have big gas or coal power plants standing by to backup renewables. (Incredibly, the British government recently approved the creation of backup power stations run by diesel generators.) Batteries will also help the grid adjust to the big new challenge posed by the need to charge electric vehicles. Given these services, shouldn’t solar batteries be subsidised? “I don’t know if it’s being considered politically but from an economics of innovation perspective it makes inherent sense,” says Gambhir. Grid parity – when solar is as cheap as gas or coal – is coming. Parity between solar and the retail price for grid electricity has already been reached in Mexico and even Germany. It will arrive in Britain in about four years, but most analysts believe that British solar won’t reach genuine parity with gas or coal (being as cheap to set up a big power station) for a decade. This will be too late to save Britain’s solar industry, if the cuts come. “Solar will get there and private money will eventually fill the gap, but it may not get there nearly as fast [without government support] and there will be more bankruptcies on the way,” says Gambhir. Murray is close to despair. To abandon solar at this moment “doesn’t make business sense and it’s terrible for the environment. The whole thing is a mess. The rest of the world is looking at us and thinking: ‘What are they doing?’” • This article was amended on 21 October 1015.

Promoters claim the schemes offer a steady and predictable income, although they are not without risk. A primary school in Leominster, Herefordshire, is raising money to place solar panels on its roof – with the lure of extraordinary tax breaks. A renewable energy co-operative building wind turbines in Derbyshire and Yorkshire has a scheme expected to give its investors 7.3% a year. In Teesside, local farms and businesses will be powered by turbines promising returns of up to 7.5% a year, while near Liskeard in Cornwall a single wind turbine is claiming that returns should be around 9% a year. Most of the schemes allow savers to invest small sums – from £50 upwards – and some give tax breaks worth 50% off your income tax liability, plus no capital gains or inheritance tax. \"You can get great returns and do something good with your money,\" says Bruce Davis of Abundance Generation, which helps to promote a variety of schemes. \"After raising more than £6.3m for UK renewable energy companies, providing jobs and clean energy for the UK economy, we have shown that people want investments that achieve a real 'win-win': doing something good with money while making a good return.\" Does this all sound a bit too good to be true? When a scheme is promising returns so much higher than the rates paid on deposit accounts, there has to be a catch. And with these schemes, there are several: • Your money is locked away – usually for at least three years and, with some, for as long as 20. Early exit is possible, but not guaranteed. • If the scheme goes bust, you could lose all your money, as the projects are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. • Prices in the energy market could collapse, or expected levels of energy production from a turbine or solar array might not materialise. But if such factors don't put you off, and you want an investment with a social and financial return, here are some examples of what is on offer. Sharenergy A not-for-profit co-operative that helps communities find, build and own renewable energy generation throughout the UK. Its schemes tend to offer shares in the projects, with tax breaks under the Enterprise Investment Scheme. \"It's not just greenies who are investing, but people who like the social enterprise model,\" says director Jon Halle. \"The fact the banks aren't much involved, or that the 'big six' energy firms aren't part of it, has become quite an attractive element for our investors. Our Dingwall project was the first 100% cooperatively owned wind turbine in Scotland, owned by 179 people.\" It is now promoting the Wester Derry Wind Co-op, which is aiming to raise £800,000, with a minimum investment of £250. The anticipated return is 7% a year, and \"pioneer\" investors who join early can expect to obtain 50% tax relief on their investment through the government's Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS). But it is very long term, running over 20 years, best suited, says Halle, to \"patient capital\". In Leominster, the co-op installing solar panels on a new primary school, has so far raised £23,000 of its £150,000 target. It is projecting a return of 4% a year but, with SEIS tax breaks, says that is equal to 10.4% a year – although, again, this is very long-term. Energy 4All Started more than a decade ago, it calls itself \"the UK's leading expert in community-owned renewable energy schemes\". Founder Andrew King was an early investor in the UK's first wind farm co-op, Baywind Energy, and has gone on to help to raise £13m for 10 others. Tom Robinson is a member of the Great Glen, Kilbraur &amp; Skye Co-operatives, supported by Energy4All. \"It has worked out as excellent. There was one year when we only got 7.6%, but then you look at an Isa paying 0.1%. One year it was 10.6%,\" he says. A spokeswoman for Energy4All says it has never failed to raise enough funds, with each scheme oversubscribed. And although members can't simply withdraw their money as they can on a deposit account, she says that every time someone has needed to cash in, other members have willingly stumped up the money, \"because the returns have been so good\". It is currently promoting the Four Winds Energy Cooperative, which has two sites with planning consents, one in Derbyshire, one in Yorkshire. It wants to raise up to £3.7m with a minimum investment of £250. It is targeting a return of 5.1% over the first five years, worth up to 7.3% for investors, who obtain 30% tax relief via the Enterprise Investment Scheme. Abundance Generation Unlike the schemes above, investors lend money rather than buy shares. They can put in as little as £5, and earn returns of between 6% and 9%. Projects open for investment are Engynious Schools, a £1m \"solar on schools\" programme, paying an effective return of 6.7%; BNRG Gorse, a £730,000 solar farm, with ground-mounted panels across a large field in Kent, paying 7.35%, and REG High Down, a £1.5m wind turbine in Cornwall, paying between 8.4% and 9.3%. These projects are all long term – investors should be thinking in a 20-year timeframe – but Abundance has set up a bulletin board where those seeking an earlier exit can sell their holdings. One person currently selling is offering £100 of his stock for £120 just a year after investing – and has had 12 offers. A spokesman for Abundance says: \"Investors don't want their money used in supporting the arms trade, fossil-fuel extraction, or even bonus-hungry bankers. They clearly love it, as most have so far invested in at least three projects and 15% have invested in all seven of those made available so far. To date, nearly £6m has been invested.\" Trillion Fund A crowdfunding platform for renewable energy projects, so-called because its founders reckon that we need to raise $1tn to prevent climate change reaching damaging levels. One of its major shareholders is designer Vivienne Westwood, who says climate change, not fashion, is now her top priority. Its platform includes some of the projects that Abundance Generation is promoting. Last week, it launched funding for E2 Energy, aiming to raise up to £5m for the construction and installation of wind turbines on sites that already have planning permission in the north, Wales and Scotland. It is anticipating returns of 7.5% a year, on a minimum investment of £50. It is structured as a three-year investment, with lenders who put in £1,000 before 31 July getting back £1,225 at the end of three years. \"That's a better risk-adjusted return than on current best-buy, three-year bonds or mainstream peer-to-peer loans,\" says a spokeswoman. Interest on the fund is paid every six months, and it promises to return the capital invested after three years. But like all of these schemes, the money is not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and investors shoulder the risk of the turbines failing to generate enough electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-12T19:27:48Z","webTitle":"How Google is using big data to protect the environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt","fields":{"headline":"How Google is using big data to protect the environment","bodyText":"For many people, Google is simply the gateway to a vast archive of facts and memories. For those who pay closer attention to its business dealings, the company also invests billions to find new ways to use the power of computers: it’s developing robots, virtual reality gear and self-driving cars. Remember all the hubbub about Google Glass? Google has been using the same approach in sustainability – spreading its wealth in a variety of projects to cut its waste and carbon footprint, initiatives which may one day generate profits. During the SXSW Eco conference this week, I caught up with Google’s sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, to find out more. Brandt joined the company in July last year after serving as the nation’s chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration. During her keynote at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, Brandt hit all the key environmental initiatives that Google had undertaken over the past decade – at least those that have been announced. Some of the projects involve collecting and analyzing data that enable Google and other businesses to use more sustainable materials, reduce their environmental impact and cut emissions. “When we think about the Third Industrial Revolution and the role Google played in it, we also think about the Fourth Industrial Revolution where this digital backbone could transform our relationship to the material world. We would like to be a player,” she said during her keynote. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the buzzterm for describing the deepening role that technology plays in our lives. Understandably, Google is big on reducing energy use at its data centers. Another often-cited effort: the company is a big wind and solar energy investor, having signed 2.5 gigawatts worth of contracts around the world and, additionally, committed to investing $2.5bn in renewable energy, including owning stakes in power plants. That makes the company the largest corporate renewable energy buyer if you don’t count utilities, Brandt said. Brandt wouldn’t tell me whether the company plans to put money into energy storage, which is seen as a complementary, if not must-have, technology for renewable energy in overtaking fossil fuels. Energy storage, such as batteries, makes it possible to use renewable energy at a time when solar or wind farms can’t produce electricity. The energy storage market is fairly new, with lots of experiments with a variety of technologies and ways to reduce costs. Brandt said one of the surprising things she learned when she first arrived at Google was the company’s project to create a database of the composition and environmental impact of building materials, something she didn’t know about before. The company had been using the database, called Portico, for its own construction projects, but released a web app last week to make the data more publicly available. Brandt isn’t the first hire at Google to work on sustainability. The tech giant has a decentralized approach: there have been teams embedded in different business units that look at ways to reduce energy use, emissions and waste and to boost productivity and revenues. For instance, there’s a team called Geo for Good that investigates the use of maps, data and machine learning to solve environmental problems, such as creating databases and software to monitor the health of tropical forests around the world or track illegal fishing. There’s also a team that works on serving sustainably grown food within the company. But Brandt appears to have been hired to come up with big picture strategies and make more efficient use of all these disparate sustainability initiatives. That means a lot of cajoling and negotiations with people who don’t necessarily have to answer to her. This is where her experience working as the country’s chief sustainability officer comes in handy, she said. “My current role [is to work] across a lot of different teams. These challenges are so big that it requires partnership,” she told me. What Google does internally is fascinating. At a sustainability conference in June, I attended a panel of three Google employees who recounted their effort to promote reusable menstrual cups, which help to reduce the amount of pads and tampons that end up in landfills. The discussion provided an interesting look into the skepticism and struggle the three women faced in persuading their fellow Googlers to try something new. And, of course, data played a big role: numbers to show the growing public interest in menstrual cups and the large expenses that Google spends on pads and tampons. They ran a pilot project at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View that saw all 250 cups being used in half of the expected time frame and received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. So the Googlers began looking to do another pilot at a different Google office. I also learned that reducing meat consumption is a touchy subject at Google, where engineers are pampered and cloistered to maximize their productivity. “When we did ‘Meatless Monday’, there was a group that set up a barbecue just outside of the café,” said one of the Google employees at the June conference. So what does Brandt do personally to set a good example? “I take our shuttle to work,” she said, before switching to “we” and her talking points from her keynote. “We are focused on composting, recycling and reusing our water bottles,” she said, pointing to a water bottle on the table in front of her. “We have a bin that’s green for composting, blue for recycling and a little bit of [space] hanging off to the side that’s for landfill waste.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/sep/03/elon-musk-solar-roofs-sustainable-homes-solarcity-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-03T07:00:25Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk aims to refit 5m homes with solar roofs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/03/elon-musk-solar-roofs-sustainable-homes-solarcity-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/03/elon-musk-solar-roofs-sustainable-homes-solarcity-panels","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk aims to refit 5m homes with solar roofs","bodyText":"Elon Musk’s solar company has its sights set on replacing 5m rooftops in the US with traditional roofing materials integrated with solar cell technology. SolarCity’s plans, announced last month, to develop traditional roofs made entirely from solar panels are part of a goal to make sustainable homes more aesthetically appealing, convenient, and ultimately affordable to the average homeowner. It’s betting that people who need to replace their roofs will be attracted to the company’s solar cell option because it won’t require additional work or dramatically alter the look of the home. In an August conference call with investors, company chairman Elon Musk said people are forced to postpone solar adoption when they know a roof replacement is imminent and that “there is a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to SolarCity.” He added that the company’s solar cell roofing “looks way better” and “lasts far longer than a normal roof”. By integrating a SolarCity roof with Tesla battery packs, it believes those homes could operate on solar power 24-hours a day. The lingering question, however, is whether mainstream homeowners will be able to afford that initial investment. A SolarCity representative was tightlipped on costs, saying they could not share details about the product at this time. Some industry players doubt the product can be affordable to most homeowners. Previous versions of photovoltaic roofs – also called “solar shingles” – have cost up to a third more than traditional solar panels, were less efficient, and were far more pricey to install. “What [the company is] talking about is a paradigm shift, not just a small leap,” says Scott Franklin, owner of Lumos Solar, which specialises in solar panel architecture and design. “SolarCity is known for being a low-cost, fast installer. Now they’re talking about developing an entirely new product and becoming roofers? In terms of cost, they’re going from selling solar leases to telling somebody they have to replace an entire roof. That’s a dramatic cost difference.” In 2009, US multinational Dow Chemical began developing solar shingles. Yet at a price of more than $20,000 per roof, the technology was not commercially viable and Dow discontinued the product in June 2016. “That’ll be the battle – the cost factor,” says Bill Ellard, an economist for the American Solar Energy Society. “But if SolarCity works with some of the major homebuilders and they can invent their own systems, I think there’s a play there.” But even if it succeeds in creating an affordable product, can SolarCity match the success of other eco-home innovations? Smart home devices such as Google’s Nest thermostat are more affordable, and going down in cost each year. Thermostats and energy monitoring systems have taken off in recent years in part because they allow homeowners to cut energy use without changing their behaviour. “Homeowners don’t want to think about efficiency; they want it just taken care of,” says John Quale, a sustainable home design professor at the University of New Mexico. “We are not great about closing curtains or opening windows when we should. That’s why technologies that do things for us are so appealing.” Brian Abramson, cofounder of sustainable homebuilder Method Homes in Seattle, Washington, says smart home technology is becoming more mainstream, lower cost, and accessible. “We probably do Nest thermostats and basic lighting control on 80% of our houses; a couple of years ago there weren’t any smart thermostats, and lighting control was only in 20% of our homes.” Success in the residential solar market, by contrast, is heavily dependent on friendly government policies, a model that has proved challenging when tax incentives threaten to expire, or when monopoly utility companies are allowed to change the way they reimburse solar panel owners for energy put into the grid. By entering the home roofing market, SolarCity is also tacitly acknowledging that aesthetic concerns also hinder solar panel adoption. “Aesthetics are a big deal,” says Franklin. “The first wave of solar adoption was driven by economics or environmental concerns. Now people are already past the ‘I think it’s a good idea’ phase. They want to do it, but it has to look good and add to the value of a home rather than just be a bolted on addition.” The company’s announcement that it will unveil its solar cell roof “in the coming months” followed news that Tesla will acquire SolarCity as part of a master plan to integrate the solar panel company with Telsa battery products. That marriage between power production and storage could be the difference between failures of the past and what Musk hopes to achieve, Quale says. “If you look at the aspirations of Tesla and SolarCity, they have huge potential. Elon Musk is really talking about getting to the masses, and those companies could very well be an important driver in reducing costs,” he says. “The conventional glass panel arrays have come down substantially in cost in the last five years and there’s no reason to think these roofing materials couldn’t fall into that as well.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-21T01:03:18Z","webTitle":"Global climate strike: Greta Thunberg and school students lead climate crisis protest – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Global climate strike: Greta Thunberg and school students lead climate crisis protest – as it happened","bodyText":"For the past 24 hours, the Guardian has been reporting in real time as millions of people joined in a worldwide, youth-led climate strike – with correspondents filing dispatches from the demonstrations across the globe. We’re ending our liveblog here , but not our commitment to covering the climate crisis. Read our roundup of the historic day of action: A moment of appreciation for the doggos These puppers want action on climate change right now. And maybe also a treat, please? Thousands of tech employees walked out of their workplaces to join the climate strike Workers from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter staged walkouts in what may be the largest coordinated worker action in the history of the tech industry. At the demonstration in Seattle, more than 3,000 tech workers walked out of their workplaces on Friday and thousands more joined actions across the country, according to Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group calling for Amazon to make more effort to address climate change. Globally, more than 1,800 Amazon employees walked out across 25 cities and 14 countries on Friday to protest the company’s failure to take more action to address the climate crisis. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has made some efforts to address climate concerns, including an announcement on Thursday that the company expects to be carbon neutral by 2040 and a February announcement of a goal, known as Shipment Zero, to be carbon neutral on 50% of shipments by 2030. But workers are asking for more: zero emissions by 2030, increasing the number of electric vehicles in its fleet, and refusing to set contracts with companies that damage the climate. “Amazon still has a long way to go,” said Danilo Quilaton, product designer at Amazon in San Francisco. “What kind of climate leader can we be if we’re still partnering with fossil fuel companies, selling our AI technologies to extract oil faster?” Other tech companies were present at marches in San Francisco and beyond. Twitter workers walked out, marching alongside workers from tech payment firm Square in San Francisco. Facebook workers walked out of offices around the country, including employees who left the headquarters in San Jose. More than 1,800 workers at Google signed a pledge supporting climate action from the company, including zero emissions by 2030, eliminating contracts with oil and gas companies, and promising zero harm to climate refugees. Hundreds walked out of Google offices across the US, including in New York City and at the headquarters in San Jose. “As individuals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,” the Google petition said. “But if we act together – if we act now – we can build a better future.” Amazon workers join the climate strike Hundreds of Amazon workers left their desks Friday to join a thousands-strong climate strike march in Seattle. Workers rallied in front of Amazon’s focal point – the Amazon Spheres, geodesic glass terrariums marking the company’s center of gravity in downtown Seattle – before marching to city hall. The mood was light, their march well ordered and rife with signage playing on Amazon slogans, including “Customer Obsessed = Climate Obsessed”. Those gathered joked that they were skipping a lunch at their desks to join the noontime protest. The grim realities of the climate crisis were mentioned, particularly the challenges facing Amazon warehouse workers in southern California, but the 2,000-or-so workers and throngs of supporters were prepared to celebrate. They’d won, after all, Amazon’s first broad pledge to contain its carbon footprint. EVAN: Bobbing along with a stream of colleagues, Evan Pulgino was awestruck. Pulgino, a software engineer from Pittsburgh who arrived in Seattle three years ago to work at Amazon, was a face in the crowd of several thousand Amazon and Google employees and their supporters. Badges colored to mark seniority, standard at Amazon, hung from lanyards and fobs. Having set out from the Amazon Spheres in downtown Seattle, the tech crowd merged with throngs of high schoolers arriving on Fifth Avenue to join the march on Seattle’s City Hall. Pulgino described the disparate mass of humanity – Amazon’s orderly herd of 20s and 30-somethings mixing with exuberant teens – as “incredible”. Pulgino, who has been active on climate issues since October, said he was cheered by the commitment made Thursday by Amazon to attain zero net carbon emissions by 2040. It was a start, he said, and a heartening one. Pulgino objected to Amazon’s continued financial support for climate change-denying thinktanks and politicians, and to Amazon Web Services’ contracts with fossil fuel companies. “It was important to be part of the fight,” said Pulgino, carrying a sign that read “Stop funding climate denial, start leading for zero emissions”. “Tech drives so much change,” the 38-year-old continued. “If Amazon leads the way, other companies will follow.” ROSHNI: Roshni Naidu, a five-year Amazon veteran, expected something out of Finding Nemo when last year she traveled to Australia to take in the Great Barrier Reef. Naidu, 28, was shocked to find a graying, vacant space. “It was nothing at all like what I expected,” said Naidu, a senior technical product manager. Returning to Seattle shaken by witnessing the degradation of the planet, Naidu got to work at her work. She began agitating with other Amazon employees for the company to get it right on climate change. Amazon, she said, can lead on climate. She described herself as “cautiously celebratory” after company leaders announced a suite of climate change-related reforms aimed at eliminating Amazon’s carbon footprint by 2040. “It’s a sign that collective action works,” Naidu said. Friday’s march, she added, “puts even more pressure on Amazon to do more.” It’s great, she said, to be able to say she’s “saving the world”. NICK: Milling among his climate activist colleagues, Nick Andrews, a program manager now in his sixth year at Amazon, was ready to scream. Which, as a chant leader, was his job for the afternoon. Andrews, 32, had been active for months pushing Amazon to reduce its climate footprint and cut ties to the fossil fuel industry. Like several of his colleagues, he struck a tone more disappointed than angry. Amazon workers tend to believe their company can do anything, including save the planet. At the outset, Andrews said, pushing the sometimes autocratic company seemed like it would be nerve-racking work. It didn’t turn out that way. “Everyone came in with trepidation,” Andrews said. “But it’s really received a company-wide embrace.” It helps, he said, that he and other Amazonians turn out – unsurprisingly to those who’ve watched the company come to dominate the retail economy and cloud computing – to be “very good organizers”. He celebrated on Thursday when Amazon leaders announced a series of steps designed to eliminate Amazon’s net carbon footprint. He looks forward to Amazon doing more, though. “We pride ourselves on being a bar-pushing company,” Andrews said. “This is a good start, but I think we can do better.” The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Scenes from Richmond, California – a town under Chevron’s shadow The main climate strike action in the Bay Area today was in the center of San Francisco, always a magnet for regional progressive activism. But across the bay, Richmond, population 110,000, more than held its own. The small crowd at the city’s civic center peaked at about 100 before a short youth-led march. Speakers took turns addressing the group from atop a park bench, rallying with call-and-response chants and songs, and impromptu speeches about factory farming, a Green New Deal and geoengineering. But while this may have been a small branch of a global day of action, the main thrust here was local issues, as residents shared updates on local organizing efforts to stop the climate pollution happening in their own town. Richmond is actually younger than the 117-year-old, 2,900 acre Chevron oil refinery that occupies much of the city’s scenic bayside hillscape, and the fossil fuel giant has long exerted outsized influence not just over the city’s environment, but also its politics. Richmond also feels the impact of over a million tons of coal and petroleum byproducts exported from its bayside terminal each year – the city’s asthma rates are far above those of other Bay Area communities. Urgency on the global climate crisis won the day worldwide, but in Richmond and other front-line cities, the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and issues of environmental justice feel even more immediately dire. ‘It is like they are burning our soul’: Brazil’s indigenous people call for international help At the third Rio de Janeiro demonstration of the day, Tereza Arapiun, a chief from the Arapiun tribe from the Amazon state of Pará, called for international help for Brazil’s indigenous people. “We are surrounded by destruction, loggers and mining,” she said. “We need help.” Amazon deforestation, fires and land invasions worsened under Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, she said. “He encourages it. Before, there was protection. He destroyed it.” Arapiun welled up as she told how a friend described hearing the screams of dying animals as fires raged recently near Alter do Chão, a renowned beauty spot in the same state. “It is very painful. It is like they are burning our soul,” she said. “We need help – and help won’t come from Brazil.” Colombian demonstrators demand a world “without plastic and without war” Demonstrators have begun to gather at parks and squares across Colombia now. Here in Bogotá – the capital – the historic Plaza de Bolívar in front of the congress building is slowly drawing crowds despite the rain. “Colombia, our land,” one group of students chanted as they arrived. “Without plastic and without war!” Near the statue of the country’s independence hero Simón Bolívar, demonstrators banged drums and burnt incense, waving signs that read “Rebel or burn out”. “When the problem is as urgent as climate change, it’s only by coming together that we can make a difference,” said Alejandra Moreno, a student from Bogotá. Unlike many similar events around the world, this one was not preceded by a major strike and schools were open as normal. This could be because events got little publicity in local media. The two main dailies, El Espectador and El Tiempo, ran agency-written stories online on worldwide strikes that did not once mention Colombia. Instead, the mantle to promote today’s march was picked up by an opposition political party, Colombia Humana, and local environmental activists. Both used social media extensively. “Why in London are people so willing to move to pressure their government and the world for drastic measures to attack the climate crisis and not in Colombia, if the problem is the same?” the senator Gustavo Petro – the leader of Colombia Humana and a former presidential candidate – tweeted this morning. “Because of something called asymmetrical information: in Colombia the danger is ignored.” Colombia has made efforts to position itself as a regional leader on environmental issues, recently hosting a summit in its Amazonian city Leticia, where Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru agreed on measures to tackle the nearby raging rainforest fires. However, local activists say it is just window-dressing given that Colombia remains one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists. Twenty-four environmental activists were murdered here in 2018, second only to the Philippines, according to the watchdog Global Witness. “Colombia is living through constant threats of damage to ecosystems and deforestation, and our cities are heating up,” said Isabel Cristina Zuleta, an environmental activist with the Rios Vivos movement, who has received many death threats for her work. She was attending a march in Medellín, Colombia’s second largest city. “In Colombia, to protest and to march is to put yourself at risk,” Zuleta said. “That’s why today it is so important to see people in the streets.” Protesters in Miami Beach wrap it up, head to “End of the World” after party The climate strike has wrapped up in Miami Beach after a “historic” day that saw thousands of schoolchildren, college students and workers gather at two events at city hall. But organizers say this is just the start of something much bigger. “You saw how many people were here, it was incredible,” said youth climate activist John Paul Mejia, who spoke at the morning school strike and evening rally for those who couldn’t take time off during the day. “Now we need to keep the conversation going, to build on this historic day and get things done.” The Miami protestors were heading for an after-strike party with live music at a bar in nearby Overtown arranged by 350southflorida, an environmental group. The relaxation will be short, however. Next week’s planned protest activities include a sit-in at Miami Beach’s sustainability committee meeting and a strike in downtown Miami at Chase Bank, which 350southflorida says is the world’s biggest funder of fossil fuels. The “week of action” wraps up with an End of the World party on the second Global Climate Strike day next Friday. Young activists in Brazil: less CO2, more vida There were small demonstrations across Brazil on Friday. In the morning, dozens of school and university students occupied the steps of Rio de Janeiro’s state legislature in hot sun. They sang, waved placards and called for the removal of business-friendly environment minister Ricardo Salles. Striking high school student Maria Hardman, 15, was angry over far-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s failure to protect the Amazon. “He does not value the environment,” she said. “Bolsonaro is an imbecile. He does not represent me.” Brazilians have yet to grasp the scale of the climate emergency, said Mariana Império, 30, a masters student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Thalita Alves, 20, a trainee teacher at the Federal Fluminense University, said people began waking up when fires in the Bolivian Amazon caused São Paulo skies to darken. “Brazilians who voted for Bolsonaro … faithfully believe what he says,” she said. Later another demonstration marched from Ibama, the environmental agency, to the city centre. High school students formed a human mosaic reading: “Save the Amazon” in Recife and held up placards with data on Amazon fires in Salvador. Students marched in the town of Novo Friburgo and in the capital Brasília, an SOS Amazon banner was hung on the walls of the environment ministry. In the Amazon city of Belém, hundreds gathered beside the Marajó Bay. “Coming from the Amazon, I feel it’s a duty to fight,” said Lidia Seabra, 24, studying a masters in biology at the Federal University of Pará. “We are united here to defend the Amazon,” said engineering student Devyison de Jesus, 21. In São Paulo, a few thousand blocked Paulista Avenue after cheering speeches from children such as Cora Ramos, 10, who held up a placard she had made that read “there is no planet B”. “If we destroy this one, there won’t be another,” she said. Brazilian activists were also present at marches abroad. Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous activist from the Munduruku tribe of Pará state, made a short, powerful speech to an enormous crowd in Berlin. “My people are grateful to have good people fighting and defending the Amazon,” she said through a translator to deafening cheers. “I saw many children, many young people, parents, old people, I thought that demonstration was very beautiful,” she told the Guardian. “I had goosebumps.” Mexico City protestors to AMLO: “We want a future, not hydrocarbons!” Climate protests started early outside the National Palace in central Mexico City, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador usually holds a daily press conference. The president – commonly called AMLO – was instead in the state of Yuctán on Friday and didn’t speak of the climate issue. But he boasted, “The fall in [Mexican] petroleum production has stopped and we’re starting to produce more petroleum. ... We’re now producing more petrol in Mexico’s refineries.” AMLO has bet big on boosting Mexico’s petroleum output and promised to lower the price of gasoline. He’s also pushed ahead with plans to build an $8bn refinery in the state of Tabasco – even starting construction prior to completing the environmental permits. AMLO also cancelled an electricity auction, which would have allowed more renewable energy into the market, and the Federal Electricity Commission (CRE) has announced plans to instead burn more coal. “There a campaign that renewables are cheaper and it’s a lie,” CFE director Manuel Bartlett said earlier this year. The government’s focus on fossil fuels has put in question the country’s commitment to generate 35% of its energy with renewables by 2024, according to climate change analysts. Marchers in Mexico City targeted AMLO, chanting, “We want a future, not hydrocarbons!” Greta Thunberg: “Change is coming whether they like it or not.” The crowd in Battery Park roared in anticipation of Greta Thunberg, who was introduced by Alexandria Villaseñor, Thunberg’s NYC equivalent who her spends her Fridays protesting outside the UN headquarters in New York City. “Greta! Greta! Greta!” the crowd chanted as Thunberg got on the stage. The 16-year-old started her speech off by marking the number of people who participated in the strike around the world. In New York City, 250,000 people marched. Worldwide, more than 4m demonstrated. Thunberg’s directed her speech to the hundreds of students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. “We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,” Thunberg said. “Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?” Thunberg had to pause her speech twice to point out that people in the crowd needed medical attention. Many people had been in the sun all afternoon waiting for Thunberg to speak. The crowd patiently waited for Thunberg to start speaking again, each time cheering when she continued. Thunberg elicited laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and “tell us they really, really admire what we do” yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. “We demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?” “No!” the crowd shouted back. At the end of her speech, Thunberg emphasized that the strikes around the world are just the start of change. “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, we have some very bad news for you, because this is only the beginning,” Thunberg said. “Change is coming whether they like it or not.” Students in the crowd said they felt moved seeing Thunberg speak in person. “I started crying. I just found it powerful and empowering,” said Juliana Rubiano, 16. “She represents a lot of people, and that’s us, that’s the youth.” Californians are no strangers to the climate crisis fight – and now they’re taking on the federal government California is not a place that requires convincing that the climate is changing. The people here don’t even need to see the science — they’re feeling the impacts firsthand, as the state teeters between an eroding coastline and growing wildland fires. Perhaps because of its many vulnerabilities, California has taken arguably the strongest stance of any US state in fighting the climate crisis, at times also fighting with the federal government in the process. When the Trump administration moved to undo California’s strict vehicle emissions standards this month, the state vowed to fight. Governor Gavin Newsom hit back with, of course, a tweet: “We will prevail. See you in court.” Earlier this week, the University of California pledged to divest over $80bn in endowment and pension funds from fossil fuel companies, citing the “financial risk” posed by the industry, compared to renewable energy. Climate advocates called it the biggest single commitment by any university, and perhaps the beginning of a new divesting trend. California cities, including Berkeley and San Jose, are leading the country with a wave of local laws to phase out natural gas hook-ups in new construction, despite strong and well-funded opposition from the gas industry. Natural gas is the greatest source of carbon emissions from buildings, while fully electrifying homes and businesses could allow them to run on clean, renewable energy instead. California’s municipalities have also taken direct aim at the industry responsible for so much of the climate crisis. Eight cities and counties in the state have filed civil lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging public nuisance and in some cases negligence. The suits seek billions of dollars in damages to help mitigate climate impacts. Maanvi Singh, here — taking up the Guardian’s live climate strike coverage from the West Coast. Coming up, West Coast environment correspondent Susie Cagle will be sharing sketches and scenes from the demonstration in Richmond, California, across the bay from San Francisco. A Chevron refinery older than the town itself looms over it, and the area is home to some of the boldest climate-minded activism in California. Technology reporter Kari Paul will be following up on climate walkouts at Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Google. And Los Angeles correspondent Sam Levin will bring us dispatches from the protests in southern California. Mexico City protests: thousands take to the streets Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Mexico City to join the global climate strike this afternoon. “Se ve, se siente, la tierra está caliente,” the crowds shouted as they processed down the city’s main avenue, Reforma towards its presidential palace. “You see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.” Protesters - many of them school children and teenagers - carried homemade banners reading: “There’s no money in a dead earth” and “Action now!” One placard urged demonstrators to make love, not CO2. There were reports of other demonstrations, big and small, across Mexico in cities including Acapulco, Irapuato, Guadalajara and Tijuana. Unlike in Brazil, where far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has ignored today’s movement, the protests received the blessing of the Mexican government which tweeted its support. In a Twitter video Victor Toledo, Mexico’s environment secretary, urged the country to reflect on the environment “insurgency” taking place around the world and to take action where possible. ‘There is no Planet B’ Best friends Amaya Mejia, 10, and Scarlett Harrison, 11, skipped school together to join the Miami Beach youth climate strike, after staying up late the night before to craft their placards. Amaya opted for a globe with the simple message: “There is no Planet B”. “You need to listen to us, it’s the only planet we’ve got and we need to protect it,” said Amaya, who attends the Gulliver private school in Coral Gables. Messages on banners ranged from simple and effective like Amaya’s, to the deeply political and often comical. “The government can regulate my uterus but not single-use plastics?” read one. Another student held aloft a sign informing the crowd: “I’m not showing up for school because adults aren’t showing up for children,” while another said: “You’ll die of old age, I’ll die of climate change.” More locally-themed placards, referencing the threat of sea level rise to Miami Beach, a hugely popular tourism destination, included one that read: “Take a stand before our city is all sand.” My favorite, however, was perhaps the most understated message of the day. “I’m very upset,” it read. Covering Climate Now Covering the climate crisis is absolutely core to the Guardian’s editorial mission. And all this week, we have been a lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded earlier this year with the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. This has led to more than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries – with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people – signing on to amplify and share content on climate change. There has been a burst of coverage this week on the Guardian and beyond ahead of the UN climate summit next week on Monday 23 September. Check out some of our pieces this week including: The silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump The sinking class: the New Yorkers left to fight the climate crisis alone How TV weathercasters became the unsung heroes of the climate crisis ‘Like a sunburn on your lungs’: how does the climate crisis impact health? Thousands of people are striking in Boston, Massachusetts Organizers expected some 10,000 people to rally at City Hall Plaza for the Boston Climate Strike organized by youth climate activists. Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu and former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy were among scheduled speakers, according to NBC10 Boston. Miami striker: ‘Does it matter if we’re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?’ Dan Gelber, the mayor of Miami Beach, received a warmer reception than any politician might have expected when he emerged to address the hundreds of student climate campaigners making a racket right outside his office window. Perhaps it’s the $500m dollars his city is investing over the next five years to combat the effects of sea level rise, which already leaves neighborhoods under water during higher than usual tides. Scientists predict up to a three feet sea level rise by 2050. Gelber pointed out the strides already taken to improve things on this island city barely seven by one miles in size: an aggressive program of elevating roads and laying larger capacity drainage pipes, along with investing in modern pump equipment and technology to faster shift the rising flood waters. It’s little wonder the environmentally-conscious city’s slogan is Rising Above. And today the Miami Herald reported on what could become the city’s most ambitious project yet, a proposal to turn the city-owned golf course into a 115-acre wetland park, which the newspaper says is certain to test the boundaries of what the public will accept in the name of resilience. “Change is never easy,” Miami Beach commissioner Ricky Arriola said. “If we’re truly serious about dealing with climate change then everything is on the table, including the golf course. If we’re not willing to even talk about it then we’re just paying lip service.” Gabriella Marchesani, 17, organizer of the Miami Beach youth climate strike, praises the city’s efforts but says more needs to be done to address the causes of the climate crisis as well as dealing with its effects. “Miami Beach has spent a lot of money on adaptation, it can be the leading city and we hope other cities in Florida will follow,” she said. “But this cannot be done slowly, and we need climate policy. Does it matter if we’re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?” Thousands converge on Battery Park, New York Most New York strikers have now made it down to Battery Park where a stage has been set up close to the water. Hundreds of people are packed around the stage, Greta is slated to speak, and many more are camped out sitting on the grass in the park. Young speakers took the stage giving personal testimonies of how the climate crisis is affecting them, denouncing politicians on both sides, saying just believing the facts isn’t enough without action. When Jaden Smith took the stage, people started running the stage. In between two songs he reminded the crowd: “We gotta show people we care about this.” Climate meme power Dorian victims convinced of link to climate change Reporting from the hurricane-hit Bahamas last week, I met David Dean, a sous chef at one of its holiday resorts. “My wife and kids had me as ‘dead’ on Facebook because they couldn’t find me,” he said. “When I called them, there was a lot of crying.” Like many in these Caribbean islands, Dean is convinced that the climate crisis in making hurricanes such as Dorian more likely and more intense. “It was very hot,” the 38-year-old said. “That’s why the hurricane was coming to us. Heat brings the hurricane and makes it worse.” Some 52 people are confirmed dead in the Bahamas, a figure expected to rise, and more than 1,300 are still missing. The scale of destruction was astonishing, as if a giant with a child’s temperament had run amok, flipping over cars and buses like toys. As so often, the underclass suffers the most. The science is complex but this Guardian article explains how global heating made Dorian bigger, wetter and deadlier. Many in the Bahamas are determined to stay the course, not least because tourism is so crucial to the economy. The owners of the hard hit Treasure Cay beach, marine and golf resort declared their intention to rebuild. But some residents also expressed concern that such efforts could be undone by the next hurricane, and the one after that. For now the Bahamas is dealing with scars, mental and physical. Dean told me: “Now, if I feel a little rain, it might be drive me crazy. I’m traumatised. I don’t ever want to go through that again.” This video is great at capturing some of the scale of the New York action. Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? How much is the US to blame? China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US, the European Union, India and Russia. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China’s carbon footprint. What has happened to the US Environmental Protection Agency with climate change? The EPA has begun efforts to eliminate climate rules for power plants, cars and the methane leaked from oil and gas facilities. Has the US already pulled out of the Paris accord? What if Democrats win next election? The US has not yet exited the international accord, in which every other nation on earth agreed to voluntarily begin to curb emissions. The deal was meant to prevent global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Technically, the US cannot leave the agreement until the day after the November 2020 election, when Trump will still be president regardless of the outcome. A Democrat president could rejoin the deal. Is Donald Trump making climate change worse with his rollbacks? The US is falling far short of its commitments to curb heat-trapping pollution, in part because Trump has gutted efforts made by his predecessor, Barack Obama. The country is on track to cut emissions 13% to 16% below 2005 levels by 2020, according to the analysis firm Rhodium Group. That’s short of the 17% reduction the US promised in the Copenhagen Accord. “Looking ahead to 2025, the US is on track to achieve reductions anywhere from 12% to 19% below 2005 levels absent major policy changes—a far cry from its Paris Agreement pledge to reduce emissions 26% to 28%,” Rhodium Group explains. The US, however, represents 15% of world emissions. Is Donald Trump a climate change denier? What is his record? Before becoming president, Trump called climate change a Chinese hoax. In an interview with Piers Morgan, he deflected questions about how his policies promote continued climate-change causing emissions. He said the US has “the cleanest climates” and “China, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water.” Trump’s White House has downplayed the dangers of the climate crisis, including disagreeing with a federal report showing it threatens the US economy. Many of the president’s appointees have denied climate change, and government scientists say their work on the crisis has been silenced. It is, of course, worth keeping in mind today the specific demands that climate groups have for meaningful action. The Youth Climate Strike Coalition in the US, has issued a set of policy demands which includes: Transform our economy to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 and phase out all fossil fuel extraction through a just and equitable transition, creating millions of good jobs A halt to all leasing and permitting for fossil fuel extraction, processing and infrastructure projects immediately Respect of Indigenous Land and Sovereignty and Environmental Justice Protection and restoration of 50% of the world’s lands and oceans including a halt to all deforestation by 2030 Investment in farmers and regenerative agriculture and an end to subsidies for industrial agriculture Downtown New York City is packed with sign-bearing people of all ages, though the crowd noticeably skews young. Students from all over NYC have come to the march. Many young children are accompanied by their parents while middle and high school students are here with their friends. Almost all groups have posters in hand. On the way down to the march, I caught up with students from Professional Performing Arts School, who caught the subway to attend the strike together. They met up at school and decided to go to the march in a group. “I just want the world to exist the way I knew it was growing up,” said Nyla Robothan, a 15-year-old student at the school, on why she’s striking. Many say this isn’t their first march, having participating in other climate marches or the March For Our Lives protest in 2018. They say that they feel like their future feels uncertain because of the climate crisis, yet no one is listening to their generation. “Our planet is dying, and no one’s going to be doing anything except for us right now,” said Arlene Guevara, 17, a student at Beacon High School in Manhattan. The march is slowly making its way down to Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, where speakers, including Greta Thunberg, are slated to speak in the afternoon. We are expecting hundreds of Amazon workers to strike later in their HQ city of Seattle, Washington. Levi Pulkkinen is there to report on this for us and ahead of the strikes there, sent us this explainer of how some of the giant firm’s workers are taking action and Thursday’s move by Jeff Bezos pledging to improve Amazon’s environmental impact: After months agitating for climate accountability from their employer, Amazon.com workers celebrated Thursday as the Seattle-based retail and cloud computing giant pledged to zero out carbon emissions by 2040. The announcement from CEO Jeff Bezos came as about 1,500 Amazon workers prepared to walkout Friday as part of the global strike for climate change. The disruption would mark the first time white-collar Amazon workers have walked off the job. Asserting that Bezos’ pledge “proves that collective action and employee pressure works,” organizers of the stoppage reiterated demands that Amazon Web Services stop doing business with fossil fuel companies, and that the company cut ties with lobbyists, politicians and researchers hostile to climate science. Those calls were left unaddressed by the company, which did announce plans to acquire 100,000 electric delivery vans manufactured by an Amazon-funded company and an $100m commitment to an environmental restoration fund managed by The Nature Conservancy. In a statement, Bezos described the initiatives as evidencing a shift within Amazon. “We’re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue — we’ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,” Bezos said. “If a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon — which delivers more than 10 billion items a year — can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can.” Amazon, making good on a promise offered earlier in the year, also for the first time released an accounting of its carbon footprint. The assessment, audited by Paris-based certification agency Bureau Veritas, showed Amazon’s direct and indirect CO2 emissions amounted to 44.4 million metric tons in 2018, a year that saw 37.1 billion metric tons of the greenhouse gas released globally. The Guardian’s Latin American correspondent Tom Phillips has spotted a striking banner in Guadalajara, Mexico. Here’s some footage from climate strikes around the world today: Miami student Greta Rodriguez feels exactly the same way as the famous teenage climate activist who shares her first name, and had a similar message as she joined dozens of classmates to protest in Miami Beach: We’ve just had enough. The 15-year-old was among a party of 50 students from the Cushman private school in Key Biscayne who wanted to make their voices heard in this low-lying coastal city that is recognized as ground zero for sea level rise. “We’ve had enough of big business and their trash, burning fossil fuels, depleting the earth,” she said. “It has to change.” Chaperoned by biology teacher Jen Russell, the Cushman kids were among the loudest at the Miami Beach strike. “They wanted to be here and the student government association organized the whole thing,” Russell said. “It was important to them. We can talk to them as adults but it’s the children who have the voice, it’s their future.” The Miami Beach strike drew hundreds of students from schools, colleges and universities across South Florida. A similar, simultaneous event outside the Broward school district headquarters in Fort Lauderdale attracted another large crowd. While private schools such as Cushman turned up with numbers, local public school leaders proved less amenable to students walking out of classes, however. Elijah Ruby, 17, a senior at South Broward high school, was banned from his prom for handing out flyers for the Fort Lauderdale event, according to the Miami Herald, and both the Broward and Miami-Dade school districts announced that absences for the strike would be recorded as unexcused. At the New York event are Zariah, age seven, and Lori Sapphire, who says: “We’re here to save the planet. So no packaging. It’s an easy solution. Focus on solar energy. No more cars burning oil. Stop taking every mineral from the earth. Go back to the simple ways. “There’s enough for everyone. Stop burning the forests because we want to eat meat and soybeans. Use hemp for everything. It almost a joke that everything were doing is being so selfishly and unconsciously. It like we’re not from the planet, otherwise we’d care.” The crowds in New York are massive but everyone is slowly making their way down to Battery Park. Earlier at the breakfast meeting for indigenous people from the Amazon and Indonesia, 19 year old Artemisa Barbosa Ribeiro, a climate activist known as Artemisa Xakriabá, told the Guardian she is thankful for all the young people who are joining the movement. “ I can see a future where we can make a difference but for that we must be listened to and respected,” she said, describing how her people, the Xakriabá peoples, a group of approximately 12 thousand people who live on the left bank of the São Francisco River, in the municipality of São João das Missões, in the state of Minas Gerais, have watched as mining companies have denied them access to the river and its water. “The scarcity of water in the territory is noticeable” she says. “ We need the river and the water for our living and for our spiritual health, our connection to the earth. So access to the river is a big issue for us.” Ribeiro, who was recently in Washington DC to demand action from members of the US congress alongside Greta Thunberg, said she felt that Jaire Bolsnaro’s government have a plan for all indigenous people. “I believe they want to assassinate us,” she said frankly. “It’s got much worse in the last eight months. We need support from outside the country because from the inside we have no support. “The main thing you can do in the west to help is to stop importing hard wood because that is causing deforestation and exploitation. That is the best way you can help,” Ribeiro added. Here is a message from Greta Thunberg, who will be making a speech at the New York event later in Battery Park: There are many, many hundreds of protesters in DC. Blocks and blocks of a roughly 6-lane street filled and more coming and marching toward the US Capitol. I can’t see the end. This gives you a sense of how big the gathering in New York is - so many people want to participate. Delaney Reynolds has addressed the general assembly of the United Nations on the climate crisis. She has appeared in a prime time National Geographic special, written books, won awards, launched a non-profit battling sea rise, shared a stage with Al Gore and changed laws in almost a decade as an environmental activist and entrepreneur. She is also still only 20. “The youth voice is extremely powerful,” says Reynolds, a speaker at this morning’s youth climate strike in Miami Beach. “I hope our elected leaders realise that current young voters and soon-to-be voters care passionately about this issue and very much want to see something done about it.” Reynolds is not afraid to play hardball to tackle the climate emergency. She is the lead plaintiff of eight young Floridians currently suing their state and its governor for “violating their fundamental rights to a stable climate system” through their reliance on fossil fuels. But she knows collaboration can work just as well as confrontation. As a teenager she was instrumental in getting the city of South Miami to adopt Florida’s first law requiring solar panels on newly-built homes. “We also spoke at a Miami-Dade budget hearing and the same day after hearing the children speak the county created the post of chief resilience officer,” she said. “The young generation is starting to realise our voice matters. Our leaders are going to have to pay attention if a bunch of kids stop going to school and start standing on their steps at city hall. They may not have a vote but they do have a voice.” The climate strike is being held the same day as the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left nearly 3,000 people dead. In recognition of that event, the climate strike is happening in concert with a Puerto Rico Day of Action to highlight the struggles the island still faces in its effort to rebuild, while remaining vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Marisol Rivera, a 13-year-old Puerto Rican student in Brooklyn, has been speaking on Friday about Maria and how it impacted her family, She will connect the issues there to the climate crisis. Other Puerto Rican activists will also speak at the event, including Gustavo Rivera, a New York state senator (he is unrelated to Marisol). Puerto Rico is still recovering from the hurricane, which affected all of the 3.5 million Americans who lived on the island. Its power grid was knocked out completely by the storm and families reported having no electricity nearly a year after the hurricane. Here are some photographs of people gathering in New York’s Foley Square. Donald Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. A senior UN official confirmed to the Guardian that the White House has booked one of the large conference rooms in the New York headquarters on Monday so that the president can address a gathering on religious freedom. The move is likely to be seen as a blatant snub to the UN climate summit, to be held in the same building on the same day. Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis. UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were “not panicked” given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly. “No one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,” the official said. It’s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his hometown. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. Many folks have come to New York from all over the world to attend today’s strike, planning their trips months in advance. Our Village, a coalition made of indigenous groups and communities of color, spoke to reporters this morning, in a studio space in New York City where they were making signs and distributing T-shirts in anticipation of the march. Dinaman Tuxá, traveled from Bahia, Brazil with a delegation of six Brazillians from all over the country to speak out against the injustices against indigenous communities in Brazil. “We’re going through a process of genoicde. … President Bolsonaro, he’s spreading hate against the indigenous populations of Brazil,” Tuxá said through a translator. “Us, the indigenous people, we are the guardians of the forest. … We need the world to recognize our contributions and help us protect our territories.” Tuxá said that he traveled to New York because Brazillians aren’t listening to the cry of indigenous communities in their country, so they’re making an international cry in anticipation of the UN climate summit. The United Nations headquarters in New York will play host tonight to an immersive art installation by artist Joseph Michael that features images of an iceberg and six young advocates, including Greta Thunberg, addressing hopes and fears around the climate crisis. We have some pictures from last night’s final rehearsal: We will be live through the rest of the day here in the US with Oliver Milman, Lauren Aratani and Ed Helmore reporting on the big rally in New York city. Emily Holden, meanwhile, is out with activists in Washington DC while Richard Luscombe is at the strikes in Miami Beach. Later on, Levi Pulkkinen in Seattle will be with more than 1,500 corporate Amazon workers expected to strike to highlight criticisms of the company’s climate policies. CEO Jeff Bozos said on Thursday that Amazon would do more and pledged the firm would be carbon neutral by 2040. Susie Cagle, meanwhile, will be reporting on the strikes from the city of Richmond, California, and we’ll also have a dispatch from Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. All week, the Guardian has been part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. Welcome from the Guardian’s office in New York, where we are now anchoring live coverage of these calls for climate action, which have drawn huge crowds around the world. We expect the US will be staging its largest ever climate strike, with actions planned in more than 1,000 locations, including major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. Here at the Guardian’s New York office, members of our team in midtown Manhattan walked out at midday local time to participate in the strike. Further downtown, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will be leading a big strike rally which she is expected to speak at later in the day, ahead of addressing the UN’s Climate Action Summit next week. Activists are gathering in Foley Square, near City Hall, and will start marching south on Broadway at 1pm ET to rally in Battery park. There have already been significant protests across the world today with millions joining the climate strike to urge politicians and businesses to take action to avert the climate crisis. With parts of the US just waking up and others still asleep it’s far from over so I’m handing over to my colleague Mark Oliver, who is taking over the blog and will keep you abreast of all the latest developments in the US and elsewhere. Back in the UK, the police monitoring group Netpol says that officers are restricting protesters in London by kettling them (for those unfamiliar with the British vernacular it means confining demonstrators in a small area) on the southside of Westminster Bridge. New York is standing up! The Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards has endorsed the climate strike, realising that Time is not actually On Our Side (sorry). The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Here is a country I’m not sure we’ve featured on the blog so far today. With the US protests beginning, it feels like a good time to highlight this article on the huge impact climate change could have on the nation if it is not arrested. The US is waking up (in more ways than one) and already there are sizeable crowds reported. Here is a useful reminder about the impact of flying. You can also calculate the impact of your next trip. Anuna De Wever, 18, a cofounder of Belgium’s school strike movement, which has organised 20 nationwide strike days since January, said today’s protest in Brussels made her feel hopeful. It was amazing, we had 20,000 across the streets. I am really happy about this strike because I feel like after coming on the streets after 20 weeks, this is our season two. There are so many people ready and it just makes me feel very hopeful. But she added: Belgium is doing really badly on the climate crisis. There is not any ambition from any of our politicians. So we are really asking them to take responsibility because right now we don’t have a climate policy and they really need to take responsibility. While Belgium has signed the Paris Agreement, the three Belgian regions (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) have so far been unable to agree on the distribution of emissions cuts. De Wever thinks the school strike movement is helping to bridge these old political divides. There are some arguments, especially in politics but we don’t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us. I think it’s beautiful that no one is thinking about this, are they from the Walloon side or are they from the Flemish side. The Brussels protest finished close to the headquarters of the European commission and European council - not an accidental choice as the EU debates decarbonising its economy by 2050. Earlier in the day, De Wever and other activists met the European commission vice president, Frans Timmermans, who has been tasked with drawing up a Green New Deal to allow the EU to move away from fossil fuel and meet its climate pledges. The bulk of those still taking part in the climate strike in London reached the entrance to Trafalgar Square a little earlier, where police blocked it off at Northumberland Avenue, to chants of “let them through”. Many people are on their way home now. I was speaking at the back of the crowd to two new mothers, Chloe Reeves and Lauren Slattery, who had brought along their children, Leo (five months) and Phoenix (seven months). While deeply concerned about the climate crisis – to the extent that they have discussed jointly purchasing land on higher ground for children as a reaction to rising sea levels - they’ve been drawing some encouragement from the international focus of the strikes. “To be honest as a new mother I’ve been putting all my energy into the basic job of keeping baby alive and looking after him and I’ve purposefully not thought about climate change because it has freaked me out so much, but now my mother instincts have allowed me to shift a bit of emphasis on to things like this and the action that we need to take,” said Chloe. Lauren added: “Actions like today have really been inspiring. We recycle and do as much as we can in our personal daily lives but you really realise that so much more needs to done, and we really are on a tight schedule.” Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Generation Z Americans want to work for employers committed to tackling climate change, according to research released today from international non-profit organisation the Climate Group. It surveyed more than 1,000 16- to 24-year-olds across the US to find out their views on climate change and how it will affect their future choices. Three in four young people (77%) feel climate change is an important issue that needs to be solved, with almost identical results for Democratic and Republican states (80% v 76%). With the US federal government actively rolling back pro-climate policies, for most young people the bulk of responsibility to solve the climate crisis rests on the shoulders of big US businesses and state governments alike (60% for big businesses v 69% for state governments). Four out of five (80%) support US companies adopting renewable energy in place of fossil fuels, with two in five (40%) believing they should be using 100% clean energy already. Two-fifths think the switch needs to be made by 2030 at the latest. Within the transport sector, two-thirds (66%) of young people would support the replacement of short-haul flights with cleaner alternatives, such as high-speed rail. Helen Clarkson, CEO of the Climate Group, which annually hosts Climate Week NYC, said: We need wholescale changes to economies and infrastructure to make pro-climate choices the new normal. It is in the interests of every business and government to sit up and listen to the next generation of workers and voters. We know through our initiatives for business on renewables, electric vehicles, and smart efficient energy and work with state and regional governments that good progress is being made in the US, but more needs to be done at a greater pace and scale. Demonstrations, marches, even open-air classes on environmental policy are planned in more than 40 Brazilian cities on Friday. And while numbers are likely to range widely – from 186 people who signed up for the Facebook event of a protest at 5pm in the southern city of Florianópolis to 12,000 promising to attend another at 4pm on São Paulo’s landmark Paulista Avenue, activists said the geographical spread of cities taking part shows how non-party, environmental activism is growing here. “We are talking to churches, unions, social movements,” said Yumi Kawamura, 45, a sociologist helping organise the São Paulo event, “looking to unite organisations with different agendas and find a common way forward.” In Rio de Janeiro, a protest at 10am outside the state legislature is aimed at children and young people. Another is scheduled for 2.30pm. Then at 4pm demonstrators hold an open-air class outside the headquarters of beleaguered environment agency Ibama - under attack from far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and his business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles – before marching to the city centre. Events are being staged by the Rio Climate Coalition (Coalizão Pelo Clima Rio), an umbrella group of collectives. “It is very plural, it is horizontal, it is collective. It is aligned with the movement that Greta (Thunberg) started in Europe,” said Hanna Cordeiro, 31, an advertising executive and climate activist from the coalition. Brazil is one of the world’s deadliest countries for environmental defenders – one reason, Cordeiro said, why environmental demonstrations in Brazil are usually smaller here. Another is that pressing problems with poverty, crime, unemployment and a lack of basic sanitation obscure environmental issues for many Brazilians. “In Brazil it is jobs and housing. The environmental agenda is seen as more subjective. In Europe it is much stronger,” said José Oeiras, 57, a climate organiser for the leftist Workers’ party helping stage a demonstration at 4pm in the Amazon city of Belém. When the Amazon fires crisis exploded, Bolsonaro’s supporters flooded social media and WhatsApp with fake news – a report by the Publica journalism agency showed how automated Twitter accounts led attacks. The propaganda deluge echoed Bolsonaro’s unproven arguments that the blazes were started by foreign NGOs and foreign interest constituted an attack on Brazilian sovereignty. Such nationalist rhetoric has long resounded in the Amazon. “This is an old argument,” Oeiras said. “It’s a contradiction we need to overcome.” Fatima Zara Alarakha, 20, a campaigner for Islamic Relief UK and an arts student, marching on Millbank beside the Houses of Parliament in central London, said fighting climate change was imperative, given her beliefs: I’m here today because it is my duty as Muslim and a human. Allah entrusted us to look after the earth and it is our responsibility to do so. I’m striking today to represent my family in Pakistan whose houses are being flooded as a result of our overconsumption in the west. I’m also here to represent the future generations whose lives will be affected by the decisions we make. I want to bring children up in a world where they don’t have to suffer from majorly polluted air, decrepit housing and the health problems and poverty brought on by the climate crisis. Manisha Jeevan, 16, isn’t sure she is ready for her music exam tomorrow. But she decided to skip school because climate change is more important, she says. “If there is no earth then how will we live?” She is protesting near Lodhi gardens, Delhi, with her friend, Kushi, also 16. They worry about pollution in Delhi, about the failure to manage waste properly and about the increasingly hot weather. “It’s September. Our parents used to get winter in this month but we have not got winter. We are losing our seasons,” says Kushi. Rishika Singh, 18, a college student, worries about the damage that Delhi’s pollution is doing to her lungs. She says: I even bought a mask, but it’s not so easy to wear every day. The pollution that we see here, and the water here which has a lot of chlorine in it - it’s not good. It’s the poorest who suffer the most.The rich are better off - they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort. It’s evening now in Delhi and, after an afternoon of chanting and banging drums, protesters have gone home. Nimrat Singh, 21, a law student, says people want action, not words, from their leaders. “We want the system to actually recognise climate change,” she says. New York City is anticipated to see one of the largest climate strikes today. Thousands of people are expected at the protest, which is being co-hosted by over two dozen local and national groups. Protesters plan to gather at a park outside New York’s City Hall and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers. In anticipation of the strikes, NYC’s Department of Education announced the absences of students in the district, the largest school district in the nation, will be excused on Friday with parental permission. In other words, 1.1 million students have been given the green light to attend the strikes if they want to. Many students have spent the last few weeks painting signs and banners in preparation. Before the march’s official start at noon local time (5pm BST), a rally honoring the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria will take place in downtown Manhattan. The central London rally, outside parliament, has heard speeches from Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas, with the Labour leader calling for tougher global environmental standards to prevent the import of products made overseas using harmful processes. From an open-top double-decker bus being used a stage, Corbyn told the crowd: So when we measure the effects of climate change emissions, let’s measure those emissions at the source, where they are created, and not put ourselves in some comfort zone, that we’re doing OK at the expense of somebody else. Corbyn also called for what Labour term a “green industrial revolution” – a version of the green new deal – to invest heavily in areas such as sustainable energy. That green industrial revolution can bring about, I believe, 400,000 decent, high-quality jobs. And with that we also have cleaner air, we have better quality of life, and we deal with many of the health inequalities that exist in this country. Beforehand, Lucas began by noting that in May parliament had passed a motion declaring a climate emergency. “So don’t ever let anyone tell you that you are not making a difference,” the Green MP told the crowd. “You are making history.” Calling it “the biggest social justice issue of our time”, Lucas said the government needed to make more urgent plans than the commitment of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said: The truth is that a climate target of net zero by 2050 is not climate leadership. When your house is on fire you don’t call 999 and ask for a fire engine in 30 years’ time. You want urgent action now. This is a striking picture, no pun intended, from Berlin. The translation of the sign held by “Merkel” reads: “Mother (Merkel) has failed, now it’s the turn of young people.” The Bishop of Wolverhampton, Clive Gregory, has asked all clergy members and lay employees within the Dioceses of Lichfield to set aside their usual duties today to focus instead on Climate Action activities. Gregory led a special service at Lichfield Cathedral to raise awareness about the climate crisis. Around 550 pupils and teachers from five West Midlands primary schools attended. Children from St Michael’s CE primary school in Lichfield arrived holding handmade signs and chanting “save our world”. My colleague, Ben Quinn, is in Westminster where climate strikers are heading towards Downing Street, but there is also a counter-demonstration by Jeremy Corbyn’s brother, and famed climate change denier, Piers. The German government today announced a new climate protection package costing €50bn, which was immediately criticised as lacking ambition by Fridays for Future protesters. At a press conference in central Berlin, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Greta Thunberg’s motto “unite behind the science”. Following a marathon negotiation session, Merkel’s conservatives and her Social Democrat coalition partner detailed plans for increased purchase premiers for electric cars, and new taxes for traditional cars with emissions over 115mg. The measures include a ban on installing oil-fired heating in buildings from 2025, with a subsidy for householders prepared to switch to more climate-friendly alternatives. A price for emissions of carbon dioxide has also been agreed that will take effect via trading in emissions certificates. The package also includes new investment in rail networks, and promises of reduced fares. In a tweet, Fridays for Future criticised the plans: Dear government: if you spend years doing nothing for climate protection and then, after months of massive public pressure, discuss measures that have nothing to do with [the plan to halt global warming at] 1.5C, then that’s not a ‘breakthrough’ but a scandal. You can see some of the best pictures of the day here: Thanks for the excellent questions, which have ranged from science and politics to a plea from a deskbound worker – hang in there! – and thanks to you all for taking part in the debate over climate issues and solutions. Today’s climate strikes have sent a message round the world that will be heard in the highest echelons of politics and business, but which have also helped to spur public engagement with the solutions to the crisis that will be needed if we are to make the vast changes we must to avoid the worst ravages of climate chaos. On a personal note, today is almost exactly 15 years since I started writing full-time about the climate crisis, and related environmental issues, and although progress in that time has been grindingly slow in many ways, it has also been marked by sudden leaps forward. Improving public understanding and engagement is at the heart of making a better future. The messages from today are clear. This is not somebody else’s problem: it is ours. This is not a problem for the future: it is now. This is not an inevitable catastrophe: we can still make things much better. A noisy and good natured protest is being held in Bedford, with a few hundred protesters, including one dressed as a giant dinosaur, marching along the High Street at lunchtime shouting “what do we want, climate justice”, “no planet B” and “this is what democracy looks like”. The protest is being led by children from local schools, clearly drawing their inspiration from climate activist Greta Thunberg. Earlier, Bedford’s MP, Mohammad Yasin, addressed the crowd, saying he was sorry that politicians had let people down and pledging his support. One young protester addressing the crowd said: “We may only be 14 or 15 years old but we’re a force to be reckoned with.” Later, a die-in was held in Harpur Square in Bedford town centre. Indy Willaert, Liza, Fran Demeyer and Jana Bameils, all aged 13, have taken half a day off school to attend the climate march in Brussels. Not all their teachers are in favour. “Some of them are alright with it, but some of them would rather have us in class,” says Fran, who has already taken part in several school strikes. “That climate is more important ... You can always do [your work] after school,” adds Indy. Liza wants politicians to help make green choices easier, including reducing plastic waste. “We can only buy plastic because everything is in plastic. We want them to help us” They all agree with Jana that politicians are not doing enough. The four schoolgirls arrived from their home city of Ghent to join the climate march in Brussels, which started from the city’s North Station and will finish around the headquarters of the European Union. Along the route there was music, drum beating and chanting. Young people jumped up and down to the slogan: “Plus chaud, plus chaud, plus chaud que le climat” (Hotter, hotter, hotter than the climate). Stijn, a 28-year-old engineer, was missing work to join the protest. His employers “were not very happy about it but they couldn’t really make a fuss about it either,” he said. “Like the other side of my sign says there are no jobs on a dead planet so it is important to be here today.” His friend, Deniz Malat, 27, a recent plant biology graduate, feels people are being ignored by the government. “We want change and we are being ignored by the government - the politicians. We want to come together to show we are serious and they should consider what we are saying here.” People are also out in force in Poland. Ten-year-old Nellie Jacobs and her mother, Helen, had never protested before their hometown of Whaley Bridge made national headlines earlier this month. Nellie and her Dad were choosing books in the library of their quiet Derbyshire town when Helen called them in a panic to say its dam had burst and the whole neighbourhood could go under. Carrying a homemade placard saying “School strike for climate”, Nellie was allowed to take the day off school at Whaley Bridge primary to join the global strike in Manchester. She said: Everyone had to be evacuated and we raced for high ground. I was quite scared because we weren’t expecting it. We occasionally get police cars coming through Whaley for something that’s not in Whaley but we’ve not had crises in Whaley. I’m worried it might happen again. We weren’t used to that much rain so it made me worry and it made me think all this rain, we don’t get it usually so I thought that it was climate change that caused the rain. Her mother Helen Jacobs said she had never protested in her life but felt infuriated by the inaction of global leaders. She said: It’s kind of getting the politicians to realise that they’ve made a mistake in saying that it’s really nothing when it’s a really big problem and we need to act on it now. I thought if I got out here and did something then it might happen. It’s been building up a lot in my mind. The climate is under threat and it has been for a long time but the action doesn’t seem to have fit the imperative. We feel like we need to wake the government up, we need to wake world leaders up and make them realise that we need systematic massive change. We’re here and ready for change to bring the temperature down. We feel like we need to shake them by the collar to make them realise. The scientists are there telling them and still President Trump is denying climate change exists! Other leaders need to grab him, shake him, and get him on board. The whole world needs to get on this. In Aviemore, a town in the Cairngorms National Park, in the Scottish Highlands, strikes are taking place. We were sent another photograph of activity there today from Iain Gibson. Nick from Norwich asked: How can I join in the strike in a non-unionised office where no one cares about climate change without getting the sack? That is a tough one. Most companies will be affected by climate chaos in some way, however: extreme weather events are already costing billions a year and those costs are not coming down soon. Foresighted companies will audit the risks they face and act to deal with them. If you work for a publicly listed company, you could try buying some shares and turning up at the AGM to ask questions about how they are dealing with climate risk. If you don’t, more of your co-workers may be interested in the climate than you think: polls show a great majority of people in most countries are concerned about the climate crisis. Dan from Tunbridge Wells asked: How will we make our nuclear power plants safe if this civilisation collapses? How does the hydrological cycle fit in? Can regenerative agriculture help? Regenerative agriculture can help, and sustainable agriculture can reduce emissions, aid carbon storage and feed the world more healthily, as recent reports by the Lancet and WRI, among others, have shown. As for hydrology, the effects of climate chaos are likely to be the wet areas of the world getting wetter and the dry areas getting drier, which is problematic. And as for nuclear power, some people - including the Guardian’s George Monbiot - see it as an uncomfortable but perhaps necessary way out of the climate crisis, but the very long-term storage of nuclear waste is a problem still to be solved. Kee from London asked: How much impact do long-haul flights have? How does the impact compare with, say, driving a car, or using electrical household appliances every day? My colleague Niko Kommenda recently published an excellent calculator showing what impact flights have. Whether you can offset the emissions from such flights by cutting carbon in other aspects depends on how many flights you take and where to. Niko from Germany asked: What is your estimate on how much renewables capacity Europe needs to build to meet its climate targets? My rough guess is between 30-40 GW per year, that would equal about 600 wind turbines per month, that’s quite a challenge (other forms of renewables are of course available). The International Energy Agency and the European Environment Agency are the best sources. Stephen from Cheshire asked: Whatever happened to the plant a tree in ‘73 campaigns I grew up with in the 1970s? Surely now is a good time to kickstart this again with planting in every public space and private garden. Fruit trees also feed us and wildlife. I have planted hundreds of trees over the years. Ultimately, however, the planet is simply overcrowded. My wife and I chose to be child free so we’ve done our bit... I love the plant a tree in 73 campaign as I used to have some of the stickers! Planting trees is part of the UK government response but so far targets have been missed. Today my colleague Rowena Mason reports on an NHS tree planting campaign. Thousands of French youngsters skipped school to march through Paris. Claude Guyon, a cinema decorator and sculptor, was dressed as a Brazilian tribal leader and carried a “sacred rattle”. He said: I’m here to represent the guardians of the Earth from north and South America. The tribal leader, who is a woman, gave me this headdress so I could be here today as an ambassador for her. Primary school headteacher Scott McFarlane took the morning off work to attend the Middlesborough climate strike with his wife, who is also a teacher, and his nine-year-old son, who is a pupil at his school. During the strike, dozens of protesters staged a “die in” in the North Yorkshire town’s Centre Square – lying on the pavement for seven minutes to illustrate the rate at which it is believed species are becoming extinct. McFarlane allowed other children at Stokesley primary academy to take part in the strikes if they wished, giving them an “education other than at school” mark on the register. While not many took up the offer, he said the fact that so many young people seemed to be engaged with environmental activism had given him hope. “I think Greta Thunberg’s an absolute idol. We’ve got kids at school who last year were coming dressed as Ariana Grande, but have now changed their hairstyles to look like Greta,” said McFarlane. McFarlane, who is a member of Extinction Rebellion Teesside, said he and his son would be striking from the school next month for XR’s October Rebellion in London. “I am genuinely scared for the future of the human race. Not in the distant future but soon. We have to act,” he said. “If there’s any further action like today, I will always let children have the day off. Not everybody agrees and I’m not asking them to, really. But I hope our example is one that people are starting to take on board.” Of all the venues globally that will host climate strike protests today, none can surpass Miami Beach for poignancy. Florida’s poster-city for sea level rise will sink under seven feet of water by the end of the century, if scientists’ predictions are realised, and already it takes only a high tide and a rainy day to send floodwaters surging inland. These dark clouds are why student climate activists from all over South Florida will gather at Miami Beach city hall this morning to reinforce their message that more needs to be done. At the most recent youth strike in May, barely four dozen waved placards and called for action - but today students will walk out of their South Florida schools and assemble there in their hundreds to highlight the urgency of the moment. Gabriella Marchesani, a Miami high school senior and an organiser of today’s rally: We’re told by the adults, ‘what you’re doing is a good thing, keep up the great work’. But it shouldn’t be just ‘oh, keep doing what you’re doing’, it should be ‘let me see what I can do to help you. How can I be a climate voter? How can I switch my lifestyle to be more sustainable? How can I lower my carbon footprint?’ She adds: We want this to be that historic moment that we look back on and say that was the day we got it changed. That was the day we were able to make people hear us, and create legislation and address this crisis. Andreu from Valencia, Spain asked: According to scientists, the “natural evolution” of the sun will lead to major climate change here on the Earth. So, what role, if any, does solar activity (solar winds, solar flares, sunspots) play in climate change right now? Are we missing something, have we miscalculated or does the sun have nothing to do with climate change at this point? Changes in the sun’s activity are not causing the climate change and global heating we are currently experiencing. They are caused by human actions, chiefly burning fossil fuels and changing land use, as successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have conclusively shown. Alex from Warwickshire asked: The electrification of small vehicles is seen as an achievable near-term step towards cutting emissions, but to replace a significant fraction of the current fossil-fuelled fleet would presumably require a drastic increase in the global extraction and use of ‘rare-earth’ metals for battery manufacture. How well do we currently understand the environmental impact of such a change and are there more sustainable battery technologies on the horizon? In the long term, availability of rare earths will be an important issue but it is equally important to note that there are no serious current supply problems as the manufacturing rates show. Batteries are one of the biggest areas of research and there are multiple avenues being explored, from nanotechnology to graphene and even aluminium, a common metal, as an alternative. Hydrogen fuel cells are another possibility. Tracey from Ross-on-Wye asked: Guy McPherson, an environmental scientist, argues that, due to the protection from the sun’s heat attributable to global dimming, if we cut carbon emissions the Earth will heat faster, and the planet will be uninhabitable for any species within a decade. Why is this theory not spoken about or even mentioned by any other leading environmental voices? Because it is wrong. The dimming of light from the sun owing to aerosols does have a small effect, but as you seem to be pointing out, many of the aerosols are soot, or black carbon. Black carbon actually adds to warming, especially when it falls on snow. Removing black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants could reduce temperatures by as much as 0.5C as work by Durwood Zaelke and others has clearly shown. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Lyra Harris, six, from Islington, London, protesting outside 10 Downing Street, said: Stop this nonsense. Our Earth is getting too hot. We have to act now for everyone. It’s not just for humans, climate change harms the animals too. Over in Greece it is pupils who have been leading protests with hundreds pouring into Athens’ main plaza, Syntaga square. Ariadni, 15, holding a hand-drawn placard of a weeping planet under a halo of heat said: I am here to raise awareness. There’s not much time left. This is global. People need to be informed and they need to act now. Maria Makarem, the 16-year-old who had helped organise the strike said the protesters had ended up in front of the parliament to ram home the message that urgent times call for urgent measures. “They have to understand, all the politicians in there, that we are the new generation and we want change,” she said, her own placard proclaiming: “Our world, our future, our choice.” Yiannis Marangakis and Foivos Anastadiades, both aged 10 and both taken out of class by their mothers Daniella and Myrtia to attend the protest, had an even simpler message: “The earth is very important to us. We have to save it.” This shows the scale of the march in Edinburgh: Ian Mantgani, 36, is striking in London today. He says: We have to put pressure on our employers, MPs and friends. We need a new power grid and electric cars on the road or we’re toast. Keep pressuring those in power for concrete change and keep pressuring them when they give you mealy mouthed answers. I believe that’s the best way forward for change.” Chris from South Africa asked: Why are we not seeing a rise in sea levels? Could it perhaps partly be due to the fact that rainfall across the SAHEL region that is rapidly greening is 40m olympic swimming pools up on a few years ago? We are seeing a rise in sea levels. And sea levels alone are not the biggest problem: storm and tidal surges are much worse when sea levels are even slightly higher, with the power to overtop our sea defences. Desertification is increasing in many parts of Africa, with climate change one of the reasons but not the only one (overgrazing and land use changes also play a major role). Artur from Crewe asked: Are we prepared to do real things to tackle climate change? We can say do this or do that but our use of social media takes significant resources. The cheap food, cheap technology, new mobiles released every year is driven by customers not the other way around so how many are actually genuinely prepared to change their way of life? People are increasingly understanding that lifestyle changes are necessary, from veganism and flexitarian diets to changing our travel habits. Renewable energy such as wind and solar is already cheaper or on a par with fossil fuels in many areas, and its deployment is increasing fast. A Guardian reader from London who wanted to remain anonymous asked: How democratic is it that a secondary school threatens their pupils with being expelled if they participate in today’s strike? How are we teaching ‘British values’ to our kids if in their school are not allowed to protest for something that fully impacts their future? What will it be next? Forbid them to participate in any human rights support act? Schools will make their own judgment, but engaging children with a subject of huge importance in scientific, political and historical terms might strike many teachers as a great opportunity. The climate emergency relates to chemistry, physics, biology, geography, history, social studies – you could probably even fit it into a load of other lessons too. Why not see this as an opportunity to engage pupils rather than turn them off? Derek from West Sussex asked: The UK has a good record of deploying offshore wind generation. What I don’t understand is why we aren’t deploying wave power and tidal power generation? We have the most coastline per head of any major European country. Wave power never stops, unlike wind, it is more energy dense than wind, and it could have other benefits like reducing coastal erosion. Tidal power solutions likewise are always available and energy dense. There is an ecological cost in habitats but a balance is needed here. Do we really think that the ecological cost of a tidal barrier is worse than a nuclear power station? There is an ecological cost to farmland too, but we need to eat, so we cut down all the forests we had in medieval times to make room for agriculture. We just need to make some room for power generation too. The UK is a world leader on offshore wind, as the latest green power auctions show. Wave and tidal power have proved more difficult, in the latter case partly owing to the changes that would be required to landscape a tidal lagoon. But as public subsidy is less needed for wind and solar as prices have come down, it might become possible to spend more of it on wave and tidal power – they may prove cheaper than the high costs agreed to by the government for nuclear energy. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the city’s climate protest when he gave a speech pledging that “fracking is the past, it is not the future” – but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl, with a high-pitched Mancunian accent and fluorescent ear-defenders tied to her backpack, gave a rousing speech taking aim at politicians for their “lies” – before turning directly to Burnham. Lies, when you don’t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution related deaths in Manchester just last year – but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats. Lies when the pension funds of Manchester are still investing £1.4bn in fossil fuel companies … Lies, in April the mayor Andy Burnham, when I asked if he would support us. I asked for more than publicity stunt pictures. Where’s the action? To huge cheers, she continued: Today I woke up to the images around the world of a million people striking and my heart lifted because I knew we weren’t alone in our fight. Thank you for coming out to support us. Thank you for having the courage to fight for our future! To adults I say, you have the power to vote you need to keep amplifying our voices. We the youth cannot wait until we are old enough - we need action now. Numbers at Berlin‘s Klimastreik have reached 100,000, it has just been announced. Carola Rackete, the SeaWatch Captain who was arrested in Italy several weeks ago addressed Berlin’s Klimastreik, to huge applause. She told them: We adults are responsible for the fact that the Earth is dying ... we should not be under the illusion that our individual actions can ... turn the situation around. She paid tribute to “the children and young people who have campaigned tirelessly for over a year ... and managed to get this issue to the top of the political agenda”. She said temperatures could be expected to rise by 4-6C by the end of the century. Extinction Rebellion, to which she belongs, was telling the truth when it predicted the collapse of human civilisation as a result. We can no longer stop global heating, she said, “it’s too late”, but we can “reduce greenhouse gases with immediate effect”. Sarah from Cardiff asked: What are the advantages people will see and experience through the changes we need to make due to climate change? For example, I believe cycling rather than driving will make people healthier, shopping locally rather than online increases daily interactions. Do you envisage the activists and media managing to put this side of the crisis across? Cleaning up greenhouse gases has myriad beneficial side effects, including cleaner air as diesel and petrol cars are taken off the roads in favour of electric vehicles, public transport and walking or cycling. Our knowledge of the harms of air pollution has expanded dramatically in the past few years: we now know air pollutants can be found in all human organs, and it is linked not only to respiratory problems and heart disease but also dementia, developmental problems and miscarriage. In some ways, the cleaning up of air pollution is easier to explain than climate chaos because people can see and feel air pollution more clearly than the link between invisible carbon dioxide and extreme weather, and increasingly air pollution campaigners are making the link with climate benefits from moving away from coal and diesel in particular. Louis from London asked: Today is wonderful to see - the energy and passion - but how can you be sure we haven’t left it too late ? There is a climate doomosphere - I’m thinking Paul Beckwith, Peter Wadhams and others who suggest overwhelming events in the next decade or two. Can they be dismissed as fringe cranks? Climate change is a problem for today, not the distant future, and the effects are already being seen, as we have extensively reported. But there is still time to stave off the worst effects if we take action on emissions now. The IPCC has said emissions must be effectively zero by around mid-century to hold the world to no more than 1.5C of warning, and every effort to bring down emissions helps towards that goal. But there are scary things we know less about: tipping points, which could cause runaway heating to take hold. These include Arctic sea ice melt, which reveals dark sea instead of reflective ice, creating more warming, and the melting permafrost that releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a vicious circle. Some have suggested we turn our efforts to adapting to climate change instead of cutting emissions. But adapting without cutting emissions is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink with the taps still running. The truth is we need to do both, and urgently.

Just to stand back from the breathless enthusiasm of the protests for a moment, our environment editor, Damian Carrington, has been pulling out a series of charts that highlight the scale of the challenge - and the beginnings of some solutions. Perhaps the most important one is this: the planet’s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. We have also tried to capture this alarming rise in temperatures in a startling piece of music. Alas, it is not a banger, so is unlikely to become a global anthem for the Friday strikes movement. But it’s not all gloom and doom. The three charts below show the progress we have made, in renewable energy generation, electric vehicle production, and battery development. Today’s climate strikes highlight a crucial fact: that our actions in the next few years will decide the world’s future, and whether we can avoid the worst ravages of global heating or succumb to climate chaos. We must effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and nurture the natural world enough to absorb the remainder, by mid-century to avoid a future of catastrophic and irreversible climate chaos. Extreme weather is already driving 2 million people a week to seek humanitarian aid, and that is set to rise to 150 million in the next decade alone. The Guardian will try to answer your questions on the climate strikes and the forces shaping them. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey will be on hand to answer any questions you have about the climate crisis between 1.30pm and 2.30pm BST.

The US is set to stage its largest ever day of protest over the climate crisis, with tens of thousands of students set to be joined by adults in abandoning schools and workplaces for a wave of strikes across the country. Climate strikes will take place in more than 1,000 locations, with major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. The young strikers’ totemic figure, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, will take part in the New York walkout and will speak to massed protesters in Manhattan. Authorities in New York City have announced that its student population of 1.1 million is allowed to skip school in order to attend the strikes. Dozens of companies, including Patagonia and Ben and Jerry’s, will support striking staff, with major unions also backing the walkouts. Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, an 18-year-old from San Francisco, said she will be striking because “I want children of my own and I want them to have a better life than me. I don’t want that to be taken away by climate change.” Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. “We are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,” said Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A big difference on today’s march in London is the presence of trade union activists alongside young people and their parents, writes Guardian environment correspondent Matthew Taylor, Graham Petersen, from the UCU lecturers’ union and member of the green jobs alliance, said unions had to take a lead in the climate fight. This is going to be the defining issue for future generations and if we are not involved now how are we going to be relevant to the young people here today when they go into work. Trade unions around the world are backing today’s protests and Petersen said it was “about time” they engaged in the climate crisis. In the UK it is difficult because people have their hands full with austerity and precarious jobs but unions are starting to realise that if we get the climate justice policies right we can tackle not just the climate but also a wider social justice issues. Lois Borny has been speaking to young people on the London march, including student Noemie, who told her: It’s depressing knowing you’re waking up to not such a bright future. The climate crisis has always been in the back of my mind, but I always used to be a bit of a pessimist ... now that the movement has gained traction you get the feeling that you can change something. When asked what she thinks about the fact children are leading the movement she says: It almost seems like a game for them [the politicians]. They aren’t taking it seriously. This isn’t for fun or just for the sake of it. It’s real and urgent. It is Nazreen’s first day in London, having arrived from Malaysia yesterday. The 22-year-old, who is studying political philosophy, said: I’m happy this is happening because at home we have a big haze problem, because of forests being burned in Borneo. Nazreen says that if we were in Borneo, from where we are standing (by the stage) the Houses of Parliament would be unrecognisable from the haze. Borneo is burning. It has one of the oldest rainforest in the world and half of it is gone. We are really proud of our rainforests, but what is there to be proud of when it is gone? He says that it is good children are leading the movement, because it is allowing them to see “what is happening in the real world”. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. Natalie Kapsosideris, 16, said: We don’t really have a way out of this. The future looks really dismal at this point. There’s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us ... and it’s all because they want to make money. Tariro Banganayi, 18, a student at Sacred Heart college, said: It’s important that I lend my voice to this cause ... a lot of people who aren’t as privileged as I am don’t have the opportunity to speak out against these sorts of issues, who live where the air is unbreathable, where toxic waste is dumped in rivers, those people don’t have a voice to speak out ... Also I am here to educate people about these issues and to get as much information from as many different places as I can ... I am going to try to diversify the way that I raise awareness ... I am going to use my social media a lot more effectively, I am going to centre my conversations with my friends, I am going to bring it up at the dinner table with my family ... because if every person tells one person then we can tell everybody. Crowds of students in Delhi are blocking the road near to Lodhi Gardens, chanting: “What do we want? Climate justice.” “You can’t run away from climate change,” reads one sign. Delhi is one of 21 cities predicted to run out of groundwater by 2020, according to the Indian government’s policy thinktank, Niti Aayog. It is also one of the most polluted cities in the world.“The lungs of an 11 year old have black spots on them,” Shivam, a law student, says. “This is why we have to change things now.” In Exeter, the protest is in full swing. Leon Hayton-Twigg, 11, (pictured below with his brother Lucas and his friend Ossian Finn, 10) says: “We have come here to show the people there’s a problem and we want it to stop.” More of the protest signs from the Exeter strikes ... Archie Graham, 15, and his friends were supposed to be in school today but felt compelled to join Manchester’s climate strike, while still rocking their school ties. He said: What’s the point in going to school if we can’t use that knowledge in the future because there won’t be a future for us. His friend, Sam Pembroke, added: It’s really important because there’s no second chance - this is the only chance we have. If this carries on it’s just going to end. Their friend, Santana Daza, 15, said they might get in trouble for bunking off school but it was worth it: I think it definitely does make a difference. They encourage us to learn about it but we all know about climate change - we don’t need to be educated about it, it’s more about taking action. Herding a group of six placard-carrying children, Kitty Rostron, 40, said her seven-year-old daughter Margot watches Greta Thunberg on YouTube and asks: Why is this happening? Why is Boris Johnson not doing anything? Why do people not make good decisions about climate change? Her friend Karine Joshua, 39, said it was important to bring children along so they understand what is happening to the environment: There’s a real crisis right now, not in 10, 20 years time. Action is needed now so we’re trying to teach them if we come together and show our support hopefully we can make a change. Here is a selection of images from other climate strikers: Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over from Sarah. The video below shows a small proportion of the staff who walked out at the Guardian. If you want to get in touch, please tweet me @Haroon_Siddique The Guardian live blog will be closing from noon (12:00 BST) until 12.30 BST as we are participating in a solidarity strike. When it resumes, my colleague Haroon Siddique will be taking over. In an email to staff explaining why we are walking out for 30 minutes, Guardian editor in chief, Katharine Viner, said: We fully support this global campaign, and we want colleagues to feel able to show solidarity with campaigners - so we are happy to support this activity across the organisation. Sadiq Khan is not the only mayor who has come out strongly behind today’s strikes. The leaders of Paris, New York City, Los Angeles and Copenhagen released a strongly worded joint statement overnight. Our shared planet is facing a climate emergency. The science is clear that, without urgent action, sea levels will rise further, extreme temperatures will become the norm and climate-related disasters will inflict even greater damage. We are making historic investments to prepare and adapt our cities to the inevitable consequences of emissions already released into the atmosphere. When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm. Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity are doing just that. School children are taking to the streets, drawing attention to the terrifying threat that climate breakdown poses to their future. Young people recognise just how unfair climate change is. Those who have generated the least greenhouse gas emissions, including the poorest, most disadvantaged and youngest in society, will suffer the worst effects of a rapidly changing global climate. They are right to sound the alarm, and they are right to demand action that tackles climate change and inequality simultaneously. On September 20, these inspiring young leaders have called for adults to join them for a Global Climate Strike. We have an opportunity to show, not only that we hear their message, but that they have inspired us to act even faster. As mayors, our greatest responsibility is to protect the lives and wellbeing of those that live in our cities. As adults, our obligation is to leave the world in a better state for our children than we inherited it. Fortunately, the evidence is increasingly clear that transforming our cities to prevent the climate crisis will also make them healthier, more equitable, safer and ultimately better places to live. The cities of the future will enjoy affordable and reliable public transport; the air will be free from poisonous toxins; buildings will generate zero emissions thanks to ultra-high efficient heating, cooling and insulation; waste will be recycled or reused, and all of this will be powered by abundant renewable energy. We have a unique opportunity to bestow a bright and hopeful legacy to the next generation. This is the future we want. That is why we are supporting the Global Climate Strikes. Mayors around the world, working through C40 Cities, are committed to deliver on the Paris Agreement and taking action to peak their emissions as our cities already have and bring them down sharply by 2030. Many businesses, investors, labour groups, faith leaders and local communities share our urgency. But we cannot tackle the climate crisis alone. We need science-based action from every sector of the economy, and we expect greater leadership from nation states. Young people are telling us that the climate emergency demands an emergency response. We couldn’t agree more. It was signed by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, and the lord mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen. Lovely thread by Mary Hamilton on what to do if you cannot make the strikes today but still want to make an effort to reduce your waste. Ruby, 10, and Dougie, 7, (pictured below), were the first to start striking outside the Scottish parliament, back on a cold dark 11 January. Back then it was just them and the police. Seeing how big the movement has become, Ruby says she feels “happy and proud”. “Amazing,” says Dougie. Staff at the Guardian will be striking today at noon, so there will be no posts on the live blog between 12:00 BST and 12:30 BST. The fashion industry is a fossil-fuel-guzzling operation, as many of our clothes are made from petroleum-based textiles such as polyester. Even natural fibres such as cotton have a huge carbon footprint and require a large portion of the world’s pesticides. In a bid to solve this disastrous environmental equation, scientists and designers are creating completely new textiles from fast-growing, carbon-sucking organisms such as micro- and macro-algae, mycelium (elements of fungus), bacteria and fermented yeast. These new biotechnologies efficiently convert sunlight and CO2 into mass raw materials, suck carbon out of the atmosphere and pave the way to a carbon-negative wardrobe. Tens of thousands of young people and adults are already streaming into the streets around Westminster in central London, and organisers say the protest, which was formally due to start at 11am, already dwarfs previous school strike demonstrations. Among those gathered in the sunshine were a group of medics. Isobel Braithwaite, a public health doctor from London, said they were there because the climate crisis was also a health crisis: “From heatwaves to floods; food shortages to devastating storms, these things are having a huge impact on health now and it is going to get worse.” She said it was time adults listened to young people who had taken the lead in addressing this crisis. “We need urgent widespread action and it must happen quickly... we are running out of time.” Glorious scenes in Edinburgh as thousands of children, parents, students and musicians gather at the Meadows for the Climate Strike. “This is our Earth and our future. We need to take care of it,” said 11-year-old Leila Koita, pictured here with friends Eilidh Tedesco, Norah Turner, Tilly Torrie, Megan Berger and Nan Zhang. Norah’s mum, Jo Spencely, says she hasn’t been on a demo for decades but she is here to show support. “I’m massively concerned about their future. I almost can’t bear to read about the climate. It’s so scary.” The march sets off at 11:30am and will pass through Edinburgh city centre and end with a rally in front of the Scottish parliament. As in London, police have imposed restrictions, in this case by refusing permission for the marchers to walk down Princes Street. As elsewhere, this is just the start of a week of climate action. On Saturday, activists will stage a “die in”, Monday will be a “day of disruption”, musicians will join a “Love the Planet festival” on Wednesday, and there’ll be another rally outside parliament the following day. Even Emmeline Pankhurst has joined in the protests in Manchester. A statue of the suffragette hero has donned a bright orange lifejacket and has a placard that asks: “Ready for rising sea levels to reach this height?” The stunt was the idea of Katie Bradshaw and Ryan Griffiths, both 31, who described themselves as first-protesters who felt the need to act today. “Emmeline still carries that Mancunian spirit of standing up for what she believes in and great causes,” said Griffiths. “Climate change is so important and we think it’s an issue she would be at the forefront of if she were around today.” Bradshaw added: “We’ve got to do our bit, even if it’s just putting some signs up and making people realise we need to look after our planet. If she was around today she’d be supporting it.” Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations in 74 countries, is calling on people across Britain to join young people in striking against climate change. Muna Suleiman, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said: Most of us want to fix the climate crisis. And it can be done. But we need our politicians to act. Climate breakdown is already hurting people around the world, with many of those who have contributed least to the crisis being subjected to the harshest impacts. “And right when we need our leaders to step up, they continue to let us down. From filling the skies with more planes, to backing fracking in the UK and funding oil and gas projects abroad. “That’s why we’re standing shoulder to shoulder with young people to call on our politicians to deliver emergency climate action now. And we’re asking everyone to join us.” Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind kicks off Berlin’s “Klimastreik” to huge cheers from the thousands gathered, although no official estimates of the numbers attending are available yet. Contender for banner of the day is: ‘Grandpa what is a snowman?’ Hundreds of people are streaming through the portals of the Brandenburg Gate, through the Tiergarten Park and from every direction onto Platz des 18. März. Lots of Berlin’s young are here with the blessing of their parents and teachers, though many have defied their schools to be here. At 1pm, the student strikers are planning to let off alarm clocks across the UK, and are encouraging businesses to set off their fire alarms at the same time in support. Jake Woodier, the campaign co-ordinator at UK Student Climate Network, said: “Young people across the world have taken the lead in highlighting the need for urgent climate action over the past year. “They are calling for adults to join them for the global climate strike, just three days before the UN climate action summit to pressure our governments to act to tackle the climate crisis. “Raise the Alarm will help draw attention to the climate emergency in workplaces across the breadth of the UK,” Woodier said. Students at Torquay Girls’ Grammar school have made a video about climate change. What’s the carbon footprint of my trip? The square outside Manchester’s grand central library has been taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and chanting. Hundreds of those gathered sang “Whose planet? Our planet!” with scores of children among the protesters. Nellie Jacobs, 10, and her mother Helen said they were motivated to take part in the global climate strike after their hometown Whaley Bridge was evacuated earlier this month when it was deluged with months-worth of rain in a short period, causing a dam to burst and dozens of properties to flood. Nice cartoon just in from reader Jesse Leonard. You get the picture, literally. Possibly the first time the climate crisis has been likened to a purple piano, but why not? If there are any other artists out there with climate emergency sketches/drawings/cartoons, send them in via this link. The Kichwa tribe in the Sarayaku region of the Amazon in Ecuador believe in the “living forest”, where humans, animals and plants live in harmony. They are fighting oil companies who want to exploit their ancestral land. A delegation of indigenous people are at the Paris COP21 climate conference to make sure their voices are heard. Can they win their battle? Tweeting a photo from a climate strike, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: Kate Connolly, the Guardian and Observer’s Berlin correspondent, has been out this morning in the German capital. Strikes are planned for at least seven Nigerian cities, such as Lagos, which is clogged by mountains of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU, particularly the UK and Germany. There will be a protest in Port Harcourt, capital of the country’s oil-producing region, whose residents and their possessions have been covered in soot for the past few years, believed to be the result of destroying illegal oil refineries. There will also be two protests against a proposed coal plant in San Pedro in Ivory Coast, while in Ghana, a group called Young Reporters for the Environment is leading a march from the city hall of the capital, Accra. Next Friday, there will be a demonstration in Kumasi, the capital of Ghana’s Ashanti region. Ghana is losing its rainforests faster than any other country, with a 60% increase in primary forest loss from 2017 to 2018. In Senegal, there are marches in Rufisque and Thies this Friday, a climate camp in Kaolack on Sunday, followed by a demonstration against a new coal plant in Bargny, and a march in the capital, Dakar on the 27th. Air pollution in Dakar is causing more and more respiratory problems, in large part because of “dirty”, sulphur-laden diesel. Environmental activists Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have helped produce a short film highlighting the need to protect, restore and use nature to tackle the climate crisis. Berlin’s main transport line, the S-Bahn, has virtually ground to a halt this morning due to a major engineering breakdown leaving many protesters stranded and unable to reach the protest. Participants are being encouraged to take their bikes instead. Many have pointed out the irony. Meanwhile, at the Brandenburg Gate, scene of the main protest in Berlin that is due to kick off just before noon, protesters have been organised into neat blocks. Apart from the huge crowds of protesters, the other uplifting piece of climate news today is that onshore wind has just became the cheapest source of energy in the UK. Industry analysts can’t believe how quickly the price has fallen. This shows the transition away from fossil fuels is much more affordable than people dared hope five years ago. On the business side of things, also encouraging to note efforts by companies with a green reputation, who seem to be competing to do more by selling less. The Patagonia outdoor clothing store will close all its European outlets today and next Friday so staff can join the protests. Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Lush also shutting today. Burton, the winter sports chain, is giving workers a paid day off to join the strike and have halted online sales for 24 hours. The company’s webpage today reads “Closed for business. Open for action. Let’s protect our playground.” In London, where big crowds are expected to gather near Westminster from 11am, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has thrown his weight behind today’s strikes. He told the Guardian this morning he fully supports schools across the city who are “working with pupils and allowing them time, without sanction, to peacefully and lawfully join the strikes today”. “It is unbelievable that we need strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously by government’s around the world,” he said. “I fully support the thousands of young people peacefully and lawfully protesting around the country today who feel so strongly about the climate change emergency and I share their frustration. The stark reality is we are running out of time for meaningful change. The climate crisis is one of the very biggest challenges we face – I have declared a climate emergency in London – and governments around the world are failing to take the action we need.” Berlin has kicked off its Fridays For Future this morning with road blockades, cycle rallies and a demonstration in front of the cuboid chancellery of Angela Merkel, where about 40 young people have unfurled a banner asking: “Return of the climate chancellor?” It’s an appeal to Merkel, once environment minister, to live up to the reputation she is seen to have squandered over everything from her support of the car industry to her refusal to back a phase-out of brown coal mining. They are keen to pressurise her coalition government ahead of the launch of its much-awaited package of climate emergency measures which the cabinet has spent the night negotiating and is due to launch early this afternoon. The protesters are chanting: ”Wir sind hier, wir sind laut, weil Ihr uns die Zukunft raubt.“ –“We are here and we are loud, because you’re stealing our future”. The main protest at the Brandenburg Gate is due to start just before noon. When there is protest in Berlin, there is usually also techno, and from 3pm a “Rave Rebellion” march will depart from Potsdamer Platz square, under the motto “No Future No Dancefloor”. Extinction Rebellion has announced plans to block traffic at strategic points “where it will hurt drivers” around the capital. Elsewhere, 400 protests have been announced across the country, which will likely attracts adults as well as children. An umbrella organisation that includes organisations such as “Psychologists for Future”, “Entrepreneurs for Future” and “Grandparents for Future” has called for people to join in, as has the services union Verdi and the German Protestant Church. “We stand side by side with Fridays for Future”, said Annette Kurschus, the president of the Protestant Church of Westphalia, “Planet Earth does not belong to us, it has only been entrusted in our care”. Germany has two faces when it comes to the environment: the country that prides itself in its high recycling rates, phasing out nuclear power and pioneering renewable energies is still the world’s sixth biggest pollutant, with 865m tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018. Borne out of this realisation, much of the recent debate in the country has focused on the phase-out of the country’s approximately 130 smoke-belching coal plants. The government wants to close them down by 2038 – too soon for many unions, especially in the coal-rich east, and too late for climate activists galvanised by Fridays for Future. In Europe’s “car nation”, air pollution through exhaust fumes is another contentious issue, with some cities having introduced driving bans for diesel cars last year. The Fridays for Future protests have had a tangible effect on the political climate, with several polls earlier this year showing the Green party emerging as the strongest political force in the country. Many other parties have tried to copy its message, with even the arch-conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union calling for a coal phase-out by 2030, bans on plastic bags and new wind farms. Angela Merkel’s coalition government is expected to announce a plan for tackling climate change, rumoured to involve €75bn of investment by 2030, just in time for Friday’s climate strike. The planet’s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely in the future if urgent action isn’t taken to stop climate change, experts warn. It comes as strikes take place across the world on Friday, calling on governments to take immediate action on climate change. The demonstrates have been planned ahead of the landmark UN climate action summit in New York on 23 September World leaders will discuss how they can reduce their carbon emissions with the aim of stopping global temperature rise from exceeding 1.5°C under the Paris agreement. Prof Nigel Arnell, professor of climate system science at the University of Reading: This week, the United Nations general assembly will be discussing how to encourage countries to be more ambitious in their targets to reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases. It’s clear that increased effort is needed if we are to avoid significant climate change impacts. We’re probably already seeing some of the consequences of climate change – heatwaves, wildfires, unusually slow and intense hurricanes – and things will get much worse if we continue on our current path of increasing emissions. We recently published a study showing the number of people exposed to major heatwaves would increase from 330 million per year now to up to 8 billion per year in 2050 – just 30 years away - the number people exposed to drought would increase from 400 million per year to up to 1 billion per year, and the number of people affected by flooding from major rivers would increase from 15 million per year now to up to 100 million per year. Reducing emissions now will reduce these impacts, but at the same time we also need to increase efforts to enhance resilience to the impacts that are inevitable following our emissions so far.” Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading: We are coming to the end of another decade. Each of the past four decades has, when averaged over the whole planet, been 0.1 to 0.2 degrees celsius warmer than the decade before; carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise; and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly over the coming decade, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the UN’s Paris agreement on climate change.” Protests taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city and capital of Gauteng province. The Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey will be on hand to answer any questions you have about the climate crisis between 1.30 and 2.30pm BST. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. With hundreds of thousands of children joining the global youth strike in cities around the globe, Extinction Rebellion UK said it stands in solidarity with all those striking. Caspar Hughes, 48, a Extinction Rebellion activist and father of school striker Max, 12, said: “Parents have left their children to clear up the climate and ecological crisis they have created. The youth should be out partying rather than protesting.” Extinction Rebellion activists will join the strikes in London and are holding their own actions and performances. At 2.30pm, a concert will take place in Victoria Tower Gardens, London. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, has written about young activists calling for north-south solidarity to the tackle climate emergency. He writes: While previous generations failed to notice the slowly shifting baselines, today’s young will watch the sixth great wave of extinction accelerate before their eyes. Due to warming seas and acid bleaching, coral reef systems will flicker out one by one. Species that existed for millions of years will tip into the abyss. Among those closest to the edge are the black rhino, the Chinese giant salamander, the Siberian crane, the Western gorilla, the Ganges dolphin, Bactrian camels, Pygmi sloths and Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna. Thousands of species of insects, plants and amphibians may go extinct before they are discovered. For many young people today, their only chance of seeing unspoiled beaches, savannahs, reefs and forests will be on old documentaries, 3D interactives or their grandparents’ holiday videos. Picturesque landscapes that defined communities and nations will be transformed. Read the full article here. The climate change strikes have spread far and wide, including the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. By William Yang in Taipei In Taiwan, dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition called “Fridays for the future”. The aim of it is to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks that Taiwan faces. Some held signs that said: “It’s getting hot in here” and “Don’t drop it like it’s hot”, after popular song lyrics. Student activists spoke on stage, sharing their personal reasons for joining the global campaign to fight climate change. Wei Hung-zhan, aged nine, said: “Our future has been sacrificed by the older generation.” He asked: “Why hasn’t the older generation remembered to share earth’s resources with the next generation?” Students said that they planned to mail their petitions to each presidential candidate’s office and ask politicians to provide complete responses to their demands through online live-broadcasts in a month. The event’s organiser Chang Li-Wen said: “The only candidate who cares about Taiwan’s future is the person who proposes a complete set of climate change policies.” Over the next week, a series of climate change events are scheduled across Taiwan, including major rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung on 27 September. People are taking to the streets in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Climate change in Bangladesh is a pressing issue. According to National Geographic, Bangladesh is one the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. Millions are marching across the globe in what could be the largest climate protest in history. The first of the worldwide protests took place in Australia, where an estimated 300,000 people gathered at more than 100 rallies calling for action to guard against climate change. Other demonstrations were held across parts of Asia. In the UK, children and young people across the country will walk out of lessons and lectures They will be joined by hundreds of thousands of workers. The school strikes movement was sparked by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg who demonstrated at the Swedish parliament. The first large-scale protests of Friday’s “global climate strike” took place in Sydney and Canberra, with demonstrators calling on leaders in Australia, the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Similar rallies are planned for around the world, with 800 events set to take place in the US and 400 in Germany. The protests come ahead of a climate summit at the UN next week convened by the secretary general, António Guterres, to urge countries to up their climate efforts. Much stronger measures are needed across the globe to prevent temperature rises of more than 1.5C (2.7F) or 2C (3.6F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “It is unbelievable that we should need global strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously. The stark reality is that our climate is changing rapidly and we are running out of time to address it. “I hope governments around the world who are failing to take action hear the voices of millions of people, young and old, unified in their call for action to save our planet. Our future depends on it.” The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. Strikes are also taking place in Uganda, east Africa. They are also under way in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Events in Italy will be held throughout the coming week, culminating with demonstrations in more than 100 cities on Friday 27 September. “Italian schools only went back last week and we needed some time to plan and mobilise, so we voted to hold the major demonstrations on the 27th,” said David Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia. More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next week’s demonstrations. Though Italy’s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Activists are hoping Italy’s new left-leaning coalition will take concrete action and fulfil its pledge of making environmental issues a priority. “They need to entirely cut the subsidies and investments going to the fossil fuel industry,” said Wicker, aged 14. “And we need to start immediate investment in green energy to help society have an ecological transition.” Young activists for Fridays for Future in Turin, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, have been holding the local authority to account over its environmental policies. “The town hall gives us feedback every two months and we give this information to scientists, who will say whether anything is really being done or not,” said Wicker. Emmanuel Macron’s government has set the object of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. However, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in the country since 2015, and in 2017 were said to be 7% above official targets. Climate change activists say Macron has gone back on promises. Sceptics doubt claims the government would renovate 500,000 buildings a year to use less energy and are angry at what is seen as bowing to the powerful agriculture lobby over pesticides. Meanwhile, it is the mainstream centre-right that has proven most resistant to Greta Thunberg’s appeals. The announcement that the Swedish teenager was to address the French assemblée nationale in July provoked outbursts of indignation and insults from opposition MPs. “Don’t expect me to be applauding a prophet in short trousers,” tweeted one. Others appealed for a boycott of her address. Le Monde pointed out French climate change sceptics were no longer attacking the message but the messenger and pointed to a “smear campaign” against Thunberg. After a slow start – an action that involved only 150 protesters in February in Nantes, reports suggest 56 organisations, ecology associations and social rights groups in France plan to demonstrate on Friday and Saturday. Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across France, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. They urged citizens: “Strike for the climate, which means above all leave your home, your office, your farm or your factory. Smashing the status quo requires the involvement of everyone: sportsmen and women, actors, teachers, food industry workers, psychologists, delivery people, it doesn’t matter. Whatever our position, we can all bring our stone to the building by refusing to accept the status quo.” In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens’ meetings”. Several French unions including the powerful CFDT and CGT have issued calls for joint mobilisation. The action group Libérons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an action at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total. Last year, black-clad members of the ecology association 350.org lay down in one of the Louvre’s galleries in protest at Total’s financial support of the museum, which dates back more than 20 years and which Louvre officials say has funded “exhibitions, renovations, educational and cultural activities and social actions”. Among the specific demands of French climate activists is that the French national education system introduces the teaching of the “environmental situation” and that France and the European Union officially declare a state of “climate, environmental and social” emergency. In France, a second day of protests on Saturday is planned to mark World CleanUp Day. A government minister said he cannot endorse children leaving school to take part in the climate strikes. Minister for business, energy and clean growth Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Friday that he supported the “energy and creativity” of students but said time spent in school was “incredibly important”. When asked if the government was listening to the young protesters, he said: “Their voices are being heard ... What I do support is their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously. “I am not going to endorse people leaving school because I think education, time spent in school is incredibly important.” Here are the final exclusive Twitter figures for the climate strike in Australia. And this is what the school strike conversation has looked like on Twitter in the past three days leading up to today’s demonstrations: There is a lot planned for South Africa today, with demonstrations in Johannesburg, the commercial capital, on the south-eastern coast in Durban, in Pretoria, and in Cape Town, where there’ll be a march on parliament. Ayakha Melithafa, 17, said she would be joining the global strike in Cape Town.The march won’t start until early afternoon to allow students to finish most of the school day. “We’ll be marching to parliament to demand that the government take this issue seriously. It needs to declare a climate emergency here in South Africa, and a moratorium on coal, gas and oil mining licences. They have just ignored the problem so far,” Melithafa said. South Africa is one of the continent’s most developed economies and relies heavily on coal powered energy generation. It is building new and very big coal-fired power stations. “We have arranged with our teachers to leave early. it is up to us. We are the leaders of today. We don’t just want the system to change. We want a brand new system which will help us live sustainably with a bright new future,” Melithafa said. A roundup of what is happening around Europe on Friday: France Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across the country, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens’ meetings”. A second day of protests on Saturday are planned to mark World CleanUp Day. Italy More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next Friday’s demonstrations. Germany Nearly 500 climate change demonstrations are planned across Germany on Friday. In Berlin, several demonstrations will take place throughout the day. The Fridays for Future gathering starts at noon at the Brandenburg Gate under the motto: “Everyone for the climate.” Organisers expect 10,000 people. Why is this week important? The strikes take place ahead of the UN general assembly and the climate action summit on 23 September. The summit will bring together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organisations to develop ambitious solutions. The world’s leaders will converge on New York for the assembly, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year. General assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off. For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.

Activists on bicycles block traffic at Ernst-Reuter-Platz square in Berlin, Germany, as they take part in the global climate strike today. There will be a “special takeover” of Channel 4’s usual evening weather report today, as the network joins the world’s largest climate strike. The channel’s social media accounts will also join the walkout, bosses said, and will be going on strike between 9.30am and 5.30pm. Additionally, continuity announcers will share facts drawn from World Meteorological Organisation research throughout the day on Channel 4. No details were given on the nature of the weather forecast’s “special takeover”. Across Britain, thousands will take part in a march. Worldwide, campaigners say there are more than 3,400 events planned in 120 countries, with numbers taking part expected to surpass the estimated 1.6 million people who took part in the global strike in March. The outdoor apparel brand Patagonia is closing every store worldwide to encourage employees and customers to join the climate strike. Demonstrators from more than 150 countries are expected to put pressure on governments and decision-makers to do more about climate issues. The strikes come ahead of the United Nations climate change summit, which begins on 23 September. While in the UK and many other countries the strike is taking place today, in some countries such as Italy and the Netherlands the strike is happening next Friday, 27 September. Explaining the decision to close stores, Ryan Gellert, the general manager, EMEA, Patagonia, said: “The climate crisis is a human issue – affecting all of us ... As a global business, we will be closing our stores on 20 and 27 September, striking with the youth activists and calling for governments around the world to take action.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will today thank young people for educating the world about the climate crisis. Speaking at the youth climate strike, Corbyn will also criticise the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for calling global warming a “primitive fear”. He is expected to say: To the young people leading by example today here and across the world, I want to say thank you: thank you for educating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss. I know the situation can look bleak. We have a prime minister that has called global warming a ‘primitive fear without foundation’. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn’t care. But when we see young people demanding urgent action, it’s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing – and it’s growing every day – I know we can tackle the climate emergency. The next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick-start a green Industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it’s there to give life and joy to generations to come.” I will be picking up the live blog from the Guardian’s London offices. Please share any photographs or comments from where you are with me: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I’ll be handing over the blog now to my colleague Sarah Marsh. There are still hundreds of places, thousands of students and hours of protest to come. Stay with us as the strikes sweep across Asia, Africa and Europe, and into the Americas. There will also be plenty more Australian news and analysis to come. To recap what we’ve seen across Asia and the Pacific today: At least 300,000 people have taken part in the largest climate strike across Australia yet. Melbourne’s event drew 100-150,000 people, and Sydney’s 80-100,000. Hobart’s 22,000 attendees made it Tasmania’s biggest ever strike action. Hundreds of regional centres joined in – from Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. As part of Guardian Australia’s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country’s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Protests also unfolded in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Pakistan and more. As our Australian coverage wraps up, here’s a great round-table discussion from some Brisbane students. They’ve finally started marching in Melbourne. And here’s our video wrap of the thousands on the streets today. More from Lisa Cox in Melbourne Edie Shepherd, a Wiradjuri and Noongar woman, spoke to the crowd earlier. She said she’d recently visited communities in the Lake Woods region in the NT, an area that gas companies are proposing to frack. “While Lake Woods usually flows with water, this time it ran dry,” she said. As well as students, unions are here today. Sam Davis is a member of the National Union of Workers and was here with his young family. “We want to show that climate justice is very important to workers as well. A lot of our workers are going to be impacted by climate change in the near future too,” he says. “The values we have as unionists are why I’ve brought my kids.” They’ve started in Mumbai: In Pakistan: While in Melbourne, the crowd is so big it’s going to take a few more hours: If you’re waking up in Europe and the UK, then here is where you can find a protest near you: And here’s First Dog’s last cartoon for today: The organisers of the School Strike For Climate have estimated more than 300,000 people took to the streets across Australia today. More than double the number of Australians who rallied at climate strikes in March came out today, with an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne, 80,000 in Sydney, 30,000 in Brisbane, 20,000 in Hobart, 15,000 in Canberra, 10,000 in Perth and 10,000 in Adelaide, not to mention the other more than 100 events in non-capital cities and towns. Organisations striking included 33 Australian unions, 2,500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, Domain and Intrepid, and faith institutions including the Anglican Church &amp; Uniting Church, they said. There are well over 100,000 people here in Melbourne and organisers are talking about 150,000. Niamh, 17, from Castlemaine told the crowd: “I fight for climate justice because everyone deserves a safe future. The government is not supporting it yet, but together we will change that.” Freya, 16, from Melbourne said: “The climate crisis is a human and global issue, and we need to act now.” The students spoke about recent natural disasters around the world, including massive wildfires in the Amazon and the early bushfires that have caused devastation in Queensland and NSW. “This is predicted to get a lot worse if we don’t act now,” Niamh said. The students then spoke about the demands of young people striking today, which include the complete phase-out of fossil fuels. The students have gone to great lengths to talk about the need to secure the futures of workers in fossil fuel-intensive industries, whose livelihoods will be affected as economies become carbon-neutral. Freya said: “We understand the role fossil fuels have played in putting food on the table for families. It’s vital we all work together, not against one another. It’s not about jobs v the environment.” Tens if not hundreds of thousands packed out Sydney’s Domain park in the CBD. Moemoana, 18, has come from Wollongong to the protest, and her homeland is Samoa. She’s here with members of the Matavai Pacific cultural centre. “I’ve come to fight for the Pacific. The Pacific Islands are [only] metres above sea level because of climate change and it’s a scary future for our islands. We want to urge people to take some action. “Seas are rising [in] Pacific Islands, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, it’s a real threat, and Australia needs to know that Pacifika are neighbours and Australia really needs to help out. 17-year-old protest organiser Daisy spoke of the third demand of the campaign: funding a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel workers and communities. “We need solutions that care for people and our planet,” she said. “Climate justice is not about jobs versus the environment. Just as climate change hurts people, unemployment hurts people.” She said too many people were already suffering and would suffer if governments did not find solutions. “If our government cares about all of us then they need to get on with the job of stopping any new coal, oil and gas projects, powering Australia with 100% renewable energy by no later than 2030, and doing all this while funding just transition and jobs for all fossil fuel workers and their communities so that no one is left behind.” Marlie Thomas, a Kamilaroi teenager from Gunnedah, said she was attending the rally on the authority of her elders, not the Department of Education. “I’ve had to help collect bottled water for our family in Walgett,” she said. Former federal MP and City of Sydney councillor Kerryn Phelps told Guardian Australia cities “need to play their part when it comes planning for the future and mitigating climate change”. “That includes our own operations, working with businesses and residents, providing incentives to people to reduce their carbon footprint, to encourage active public transport, to encourage renewable sources of energy. “And because of the sheer size of the population, not only do they contribute so much to climate change risk but they also have the most, I think, to offer. Obviously we’ve got the agriculture sector, which needs to play its part, the transport sector, but individuals also can do so much themselves.” With the Australian strikes not even half over in many places, here’s what has happened so far: Hundreds of thousands have participated in the largest climate strike across Australia yet: more than 100 locations, from capital cities to regional centres such as Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. In Sydney and Melbourne crowds were estimated at 80,000 to 150,000 respectively, making them the biggest demonstrations since the Iraq war. In Tasmania 22,000 marchers made it the biggest strike action the state had ever seen. As part of Guardian Australia’s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country’s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Protests in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more also continued throughout the day. They’re marching in the Philippines, too. Justin McCurry in Japan writes: Japan has suffered unseasonable, powerful and fatal storms in recent years that have also inflicted serious damage on its infrastructure. Last week’s typhoon was unusually strong, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. The country has also been hit by record-breaking heatwaves – one last summer killed 65 people in a single week. Japan’s government had planned to expand nuclear power in an effort to tackle carbon dioxide emissions, but the Fukushima disaster changed all that. Pressure is building to invest more in renewables as the government expands coal-fired power stations and imports of gas and oil to fill the energy gap left by the post-Fukushima closure of dozens of nuclear reactors. Japan’s involvement in the climate strike has been low key. This Friday adults and children belonging to the Fridays for Future Tokyo movement will gather outside the United Nations University in central Tokyo at 5pm, make speeches and then march through the streets of the capital. Just over 100 people turned up in March; students at Japanese state schools were noticeably absent and I think that will be the case this Friday. A few protests have begun in Japan, and one is scheduled for Tokyo at 5pm local time. I cannot stress enough that my favourite thing from today is students on the ground interviewing their fellow strikers. Here is Oscar Lander-McBride, 10, interviewing Zac, 13. And from earlier, Esther Plummer, 13, interviewing Jasper, 15. There are more than 100,000 people in Melbourne, according to organisers. An aerial view of Melbourne, only 30 minutes in. And here’s the march crossing Brisbane’s Victoria bridge: In Bali: In Singapore: And in Brisbane who better to give a crowd estimate than Haemish Lander-McBride, 13, who has been to the past two strikes. “It’s massive in comparison to the other ones ... People aren’t just going to the first one – people are really coming again and again and again.” And big crowds in Adelaide: An estimated 10,000 in Perth: Mike Bowers in Canberra: It’s just past 2pm, which is the official start time in Melbourne. But as we saw in Sydney, crowds are so huge there are lines to get in. It’ll take a while to get into full swing. Early crowd numbers out of Sydney: 50,000 to 80,000 people at least. More from First Dog: Over on 2GB in Sydney and 4BC in Brisbane this morning Alan Jones was keeping a sceptical eye on the climate strike. “If you ask some of these people what it was about they wouldn’t have a clue,” Jones said without actually asking any of the strikers that question. An elderly caller suggested the children’s minds were being manipulated just like those of the Hitler Youth in Germany decades ago. Warming to the theme, Jones had a Goebbels quote on hand: “I will remind our listeners that his minister of propaganda ,Joseph Goebbels, also said it would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and the psychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is in fact a circle. They are mere words and words can be moulded until they clothe ideas in disguise. This is what’s going on here isn’t it? Immensely disturbing I have to say. Immensely disturbing.” Former Queensland Greens senator Andrew Bartlett has this estimate: Similar thoughts in Sydney: The Brisbane rally keeps growing. People are still streaming in 30 minutes after the posted start time and police have had to shut roads on two sides of Queens Park. Hard to guess at a crowd figure, but comfortably over 10,000 at this point. This is not, of course, an anti-government rally, but there’s certainly no love for the coal embrace of the Queensland government. And notably, there are at least a half dozen left-wing unions here. The Electrical Trades Union has just taken a swipe, officials complaining the government has let the private sector do the heavy lifting on renewables, and giving a strong endorsement of climate action. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Delhi writes: Students protesters in India have a long list of demands for their political leaders. The air in many of its cities is infamously toxic, poor waste management is putting lives at risk and water shortages have reached crisis levels. Last year India was ranked among the bottom five countries on the environmental performance index produced by Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum. “We are in September now and we would be usually subjected to monsoon rains at this time but the rainfall is so erratic,” said Jacintha Thota, 14, who lives in Hyderabad. On Friday 200 students from her school and some of their teachers are expected to march together. Hyderabad is one of tens of locations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, where protests are expected to take place. The Fridays for Future movement is much smaller than other more established environmental campaigns in India, but students say it is growing in popularity, thanks partly to social media. In Delhi protesters are planning seven days of action, which includes marching to the ministry of urban affairs and housing on Friday. On Sunday protesters will meet at Bhalswa landfill, the second biggest dump yard in the city, while next week they will protest at other key political buildings. Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist from Fridays For Future India will take part. “We have beautiful laws on the paper but none of it is being executed,” she said. Five years ago, when her daughters had an X-ray, she discovered the impact of Delhi’s pollution. “Their lungs were black in colour; they should be pink. For a child who is born and brought up in Delhi for 10 years this is the damage that they suffer,” she said. Her twin daughters, 15, will also be attending the march in Delhi. “The rich think ‘Oh I’ll put a mask on my child’, ‘I’ll get an air purifier’, and the poorest they can barely make two meals [a day].” Big turnout in Thailand – and a reminder that many of the protests in Asia will be kicking into gear soon as well. Wait no, maybe this one: Calling the winner now Meanwhile the Brisbane protest has broken its banks and people are streaming down the streets. There’s already a crowd at Treasury Gardens for the Melbourne school strike which kicks off at 2pm. Thea Hamilton, 16, is one of the organisers. “I’m really excited and hopefully we’ll be able to get some really good action out of this and get more people involved in climate action and climate justice,” she says. She says young people “are looking for a space to be heard and to really feel represented by this global movement so we can call for climate action at the UN global climate summit on the 23rd”. Continuing our series. EnergyAustralia has agreed to take a question from a climate striker. Along with Queensland’s Stanwell Corporation, it is the other one of Australia’s top 10 carbon emitters to agree to take a question. Josh O’Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide asks: What are the future initiatives that your company plans to put in place to have 100% renewable energy production? Mark Collette, the head of EnergyAustralia’s customer business: Thanks Josh. Designing and building a 100% renewable energy system is a huge challenge for Australia. I think Australians are up for the challenge. Your home state of South Australia has solar and wind already providing over half of the electricity supplied to South Australians. In planning for 100% renewables, the first 50% is easier than the second 50%. Solar and wind generation follow the sun and the wind, so when it is not sunny and windy we can’t produce power for customers. I reckon that above about 50% renewables for Australia we need to find ways to move the power from the sun and the wind to dark and still times, or use it immediately. One way we do this is storage. Already we have two of the largest batteries in the country in Victoria, and we are working on two large pumped hydro projects – one of which is in your state of South Australia. Another way we are exploring is helping customers use power when it is available from the sun and the wind. We can time pool pumps and hot water systems to run just through these times. There’s a long way to go but we like tackling tough problems, like the second 50%.” In Sydney Daisy, 17, tells the crowd their frustration has never been about people working in the fossil-fuel industry. Their demand is “about acting to halt this crisis while creating safe and meaningful work for all of us”. And let’s not forget the regions. More photos from Lismore from Frewoini Baume: And these beautiful pictures from Katherine in the NT: And here’s Albury: The crowd in Sydney is getting so big you can really only see it from the air. Perth and Canberra aren’t too shabby either: This is the third nationwide climate strike in Australia – after November 2018 and March 2019. They get bigger every time. Amelia Neylon, 16, is on the ground and tells Guardian Australia: The crowd is reportedly over 22,000. Bob Brown at this count has said it is larger then the Franklin River rally. Making this the largest rally in Tasmania held to date. It’s all happening. Another must-watch, exclusive to Guardian Australia: Meanwhile Australia’s strikes are making waves around the world: If you are Gen X or above, then you can laugh at the latest from First Dog on the Moon instead*: *This is a joke – First Dog is funny for all ages. I’m a millennial / Gen Z so I understand these signs. If you don’t, rest assured they are very funny. In Brisbane, here’s Parker with his message to the government – and a great poem. The award for best sign is getting more competitive every minute. Here is Matilda (3). Sydney’s strikes have started but aren’t even at full swing, Melbourne’s starts in 1.5 hours, and preparations have begun in Perth. Earlier today we saw huge turnouts in regional areas, including Alice Springs and Byron Bay. Angus Taylor has also agreed to take a question. From Josh O’Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide: It is said that ‘if those who believe in climate change are wrong, we will have needlessly created a cleaner world, but if those who don’t believe in climate change are wrong, we will die’. Do you agree? If so, how should we act on this? Angus Taylor : The federal government is taking strong action to reduce global emissions and respond to the serious challenge of climate change. The government’s $3.5bn climate solutions package sets out how we will meet our 2030 Paris target, down to the last tonne. People are free to have their views, but my personal opinion is that students should be at school during school hours.” Reporter Helen Davidson is on the ground in Sydney: Our first dispatches from Amelia Neylon in Hobart: Meanwhile crowds build in Sydney. There is a LONG line to get in. Esther in Byron Bay has interviewed her fellow strikers. Must-watch. First images in from Hobart: Sydney’s strike is scheduled to start at noon. Huge crowds are still making their way to the city. This could take some time and is looking immense. Some footage from Thailand: Continuing our Q&amp;A series is Labor’s spokesman on climate change and energy, Mark Butler. Frewoini Baume, 18, from Lismore asks: Permanent destruction for temporary economic gain is not a sustainable or stable economy. Why are you supporting the coal industry when it has been scientifically proven to be unsustainable? Yes, the economy may temporarily suffer but the longer you wait the more severe the impact. So why not act now? Mark Butler: The Labor party remains deeply committed to taking climate action to make sure that we comply with the commitments to future generations in the Paris agreement – to keep global warming way below 2 degrees and to pursue efforts around 1.5 degrees to make sure that we are at net zero emissions by the middle of the century. There is no denying that Australia needs to drastically reduce its carbon emissions, but after coming down by more than 10% when Labor was last in office, emissions have been rising ever since the election of Tony Abbott, and the government’s own data shows they will keep rising all the way to 2030. Australia doesn’t have a national climate policy. That is why we need to keep pressuring the Liberal government to take serious climate action.” Some more charts, this time Australia-specific from our data editor, Nick Evershed: This first shows warming in Australia, measuring how different the temperature is in a given year against the long-term average. Put simply, it demonstrates how things are getting hotter, and 2018 was the third-hottest year: This second shows Australia’s quarterly emissions over time. The bars need to be under the two lines (assuming a linear rate of reduction to meet the target) if we are going to meet various emissions targets. The pink line shows the trajectory to a 28% reduction in emissions, based on 2005 levels, by 2030. This is the more ambitious of Australia’s possible reduction targets under the Paris agreement. The purple line is the trajectory proposed by the Climate Change Authority based on the best available science to ensure Australia makes a meaningful contribution towards keeping global temperature increases under 2C. Ideally the bars should be below both lines. And some early data from Twitter: #ClimateStrike is trending #1 in Australia and has been for the past two hours #schoolstrike4climate is at #2 and #friday4future is at #5 Australian cities where #climatestrike is trending: Adelaide #2 Darwin #1 Melbourne #1 Perth #1 Sydney #1 An on-the-ground sketch from First Dog on the Moon You may have noticed the arresting temperature chart at the top of our site this morning – I know I did. Our colleagues internationally have also compiled more charts that explain the climate crisis. And some slightly better news: In Lismore Frewoini Baume has interviewed Suhani Sheppeard, 16. FB: “Why are you striking?” SS: “I’m striking because I believe it takes one person to change the world. Having that opportunity to be that person is incredibly inspiring and I want to be the one voice to inspire others. “It feels incredibly empowering to be a part of the community in our global strike, and inspires me to always fight for climate justice.” Jotham Napat, Vanuatu’s deputy prime minister, delivered his speech in English “because the people who need to hear this, the ones who are causing the problems, are not here”. According to the Vanuatu Posts’ Dan McGarry, Napat named the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as the ones who are “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Earlier Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister, Ralph Regenvanu, also spoke and criticised Australia. He characterised the discussions at the recent Pacific Islands forum in Tuvalu as a “fight” between Australia and the rest of the Pacific. Regenvanu, an outspoken Pacific leader, has also promised to take his country’s climate grievance to the International Court of Justice to seek legal redress. During the Pacific Islands forum Regenvanu told the Guardian that critical talks almost collapsed twice amid “fierce” clashes between Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and other Pacific leaders. “Australia is out there – they’re not with us,” Regenvanu said at the time. Today students in Vanuatu partnered with the Vanuatu climate action network to stage a silent strike. Students wearing traditional dress and holding banners with messages about the climate crisis stood around the capital, Port Vila, as politicians walked around the city viewing the messages, finishing up at the seafront of the city where there were art exhibitions, poetry performances and speeches. In Albury the march will head to the office of the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Our first Q&amp;A is in. The Stanwell Corporation is one of Australia’s biggest energy companies. EnergyAustralia and Stanwell were the only members of Australia’s top 10 carbon emitters who agreed to take a question for our live blog today. Narii Hamill-Salmon, 15, from the Gold Coast asks: The Stanwell Corporation was named as the nation’s third largest carbon emitter in 2017-18 [by the Clean Energy Regulator] thus making the company a significant contributor to the climate crisis. Mr Van Breda, if you could say one thing to the future generations of this planet, the ones who are going to experience the most devastating impacts of climate change, what would you tell them?” Richard Van Breda, chief executive: Thanks for your question, Narii. I think a lot about that, and here’s what I would tell future generations about the work we do at Stanwell. The electricity industry is at a tricky time in its transition to lower carbon technologies. The proportion of low carbon energy and storage in Australia is increasing quickly, but those technologies are not yet at a point where they can function without support from fossil fuel generation. As a company that operates coal-fired power stations, it’s Stanwell’s job to provide the electricity that people need, as the industry moves to a lower carbon future. That change can’t happen immediately and needs to be planned and done carefully. We ramp generation from our coal-fired power stations up and down every day to support solar generation in the middle of the day, and still provide the electricity people need in the evenings. We are also exploring new generation and storage technology that will help reduce emissions. I’m really proud of the work Stanwell people are doing in all those areas.” And Frewoini Baume, 18, has sent through the first few images of the Lismore strikes. If people want a last minute sign for the climate strike First Dog on the Moon says you can print this out on vegan paper and wave it about. More dispatches from Esther in Byron: There are big contingents and great photos coming in from all across the Pacific – especially Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands right now. And in Castlemaine, Victoria, where this all began (in Australia at least), there are no signs of slowing. Early signs from University of Sydney: And nearby, stores all along King Street have closed for the day in solidarity. In Gloucester New South Wales we have an early contender for best costume today (the sunflower). In a landmark decision earlier this year, a court blocked a new coalmine in the region because of the “dire consequences” of increasing emissions. Absolutely huge turnout in Geelong where they’re singing and chanting. And more from Townsville: It’s not even 11am yet on the east coast and it’s already obvious today’s protests are going to be bigger than ever before. First Barnesy now The Oils: In Vanuatu: The Knitting Nannas are already down in Lismore. Our first student on the ground Esther Plummer (13) has sent pictures from Byron Bay. Earlier we said 1,000 businesses are supporting the strike. That number is now 2,600, with the latest figures from Not Business As Usual. And here is music legend (and all-round legend) Jimmy Barnes, with his message of support to the strikers. In New Caledonia: Big turnout in Townsville. The event there started at 9am and they will be marching at 10am. Protesters are staging a die-in in the centre of Alice Springs. Traditional owners have stressed the importance of putting Indigenous perspectives at the centre of these protests. Yesterday Sammy Wilson, a custodian of Uluru and chair of the Central Land Council, announced that the council will join the strike across the Northern Territory. “Aboriginal people want to be part of the solution,” he said. “We want to have access to clean technologies such as solar power so that our children have the chance to keep living on our traditional country. “I support their right to take this action [and] I call on them to spare a thought for Aboriginal people out bush who may not be able to travel to the strikes but who are already suffering most during our hotter, longer and drier summers.” After the NT’s hottest summer on record, delegates at the council meeting last month said climate change and water security were their top policy priorities. Kate Lamb in Jakarta writes: In Indonesia the climate strikes come as the country faces an escalating environmental emergency – tens of thousands of hectares of rainforest are burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan, home to some of the largest swathes of virgin forest in the world. This year the annual fires – a result of “slash and burn” practices to clear land mostly for palm oil plantations – have been exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon and severe droughts. Thick haze has blanketed cities in Indonesia and neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia, and also forced schools to be closed and increased the risk of respiratory-related illnesses. Also on the minds of young Indonesian activists is how to curb the country’s plastic addiction. Home to more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the second largest contributor to ocean plastics after China. But in recent years environmental awareness around plastics has gained momentum, largely driven by inspiring Indonesian students, artists, musicians and activists. On Friday hundreds are expected to take to the streets of Jakarta and 12 cities across the archipelago, on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Bali. Expect colourful costumes, live performances from local indie bands, and talk of an “energy revolution”. From here in the steamy tropics, the focus of that discussion will be on the future of solar energy. More from the Pacific from Kate Lyons Climate strike events kicked off in Tonga yesterday (which held its main event – a community clean-up on Thursday because of the significant number of Seventh Day Adventists in the country who observe the Sabbath on Fridays). Pacific countries, many of which are bearing the brunt of the effects of the climate crisis, are holding events today, though most are not holding strikes or traditional protests, instead focusing on community events such as clean-ups, barbecues and poetry performances. Things are already well under way in Alice Springs. Up to 60 local businesses have also shut their doors for today. Meanwhile preparations continue around the country. Eleanor Ainge Roy writes from Dunedin New Zealand is pushing back its participation in the strikes to Friday 27 September so high school students can sit national exams this week. Large strikes are planned nationwide. Sea level rise is a real and increasingly urgent threat to New Zealand. Most of New Zealand’s nearly 5 million people live on the coast. Sea walls to protect vulnerable communities are being constructed – from the former gold-mining town of Hokitika on the west coast to vulnerable beachside huts in the isolated far north. Sea level rise is also a pressing issue for the country’s Indigenous people, with their tribal marae [meeting houses] mostly on low-lying coastal land. Jacinda Ardern’s Labour coalition government has vowed to tackle climate change head on, committing to making the country carbon neutral by 2050 and planting 1bn trees. The first climate strike in New Zealand was interrupted by the Christchurch mosque attacks, with children in central Christchurch shepherded into lockdown for hours. It was initially thought, incorrectly, that the striking children may have been a target. Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand’s policy manager, Annaliese Johnston, says New Zealand youth climate groups have been instrumental in increasing awareness in the Pacific region. “The youth of today in New Zealand ... have woken us all up to the urgent call to action to protect our common home and future.” Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish student who inspired this movement, has recorded a short film for today’s strike. In it, she and Guardian columnist George Monbiot talk about the importance of natural solutions – low-cost, effective initiatives such as rowing trees. And for a bit of a blast from the past you can read Thunberg’s opinion piece from November 2018 – written specifically for Australia – when we became one of the first countries to hold nationwide student strikes. “In the Pacific we don’t go on strike, but we do other things,” says Patricia Mallam, a Fijian climate activist from 350.org. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea will take part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events, barbecues and intergenerational discussions about the effects of climate change in the region. These events rather than traditional protests and street marches make more sense for the Pacific, says Mallam, because it is such a community-driven region “and we all know that the problem is not within the community”. “For instance, you don’t have any coalmines in the Pacific, so we can’t have people striking outside coalmines. The problems are not being caused here. But in countries where there are coalmines or banks financing the fossil-fuel industry, it makes sense for people to go on strike, so they’re voicing their distaste for what’s going on to keep their economies afloat,” she says over the phone from Fiji. “We all know that the problem is not being caused here in the Pacific, but we’re facing the full brunt of the climate crisis.” The Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world’s population, but is at the frontline of the climate emergency, with countries facing rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs, inundations and warming seas that lead to more frequent and more severe cyclones. “It is a day, especially for the polluters, they need to quickly understand what’s going on,” says Mallam. “But at the same time, in the Pacific we feel that because we’re at the frontline of the impacts, it’s important for us to speak up and have other nations hear what’s happening.” Preparations are under way in the Solomon Islands already. And Kate Lyons spoke to some of the activists across the Pacific ahead of today’s big day. Here’s everything you need to know about today’s strikes as collated by my colleague Lisa Cox. There are more than 100 locations, and the strikes have support from 30 unions, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and more than 1,000 businesses including Atlassian, Future Super and KeepCup. And in news from this morning, more than 250 academics have also signed on in support. Morning everyone. Today the global climate strikes start in Australia and the Pacific. The Guardian Australia team will follow it all. We have a huge day of coverage planned. The Australian strikes will be in full swing from 11am or noon (local time) and before that in New Zealand and the Pacific. Our correspondents are standing by, and cartoonist First Dog on the Moon is on duty – they’ll be sketching throughout the day. And because today is really about the students, we’ve organised to receive on-the-ground updates from participants. Here they are in a (non-exhaustive) list: Narii-Hamill Salmon, 15, Gold Coast Qld Frewoini Baume, 18, Lismore NSW Josh O’Callaghan, 15, Adelaide SA Amelia Neylon, 16, Hobart Tas Esther Plummer, 13, Byron Bay NSW Iestyn (13) and Owynn (11) Harries, Brisbane Qld Dakota Barret-Perry, 15, Melbourne Vic They have also been given the opportunity to ask a question directly of federal politicians and prominent business leaders – from the energy minister to EnergyAustralia. We’ll publish the questions and their answers throughout the day. Stay with us. For the next 24 hours, the Guardian will be reporting in real time on the wave of climate strikes as they ripple around the world, starting in the Asia-Pacific region and continuing through Europe and Africa before culminating in the Americas. Millions of young people are expected to turn out in more than 3,000 events worldwide in this latest edition of the Fridays For Future strikes. On this occasion, adults have been invited to join in and companies, organisations, trade unions, even churches are expected to join the fray. Our correspondents on the ground will be feeding in with live updates from the world’s major metropolises, and we’ll be pausing for breath every now and then to consider the bigger picture, the state we’re in, the scale of the challenge. The strike kicks off a big week for environmental activism with a major climate action summit at the UN next week and another round of Friday strikes on the 27th. The Guardian will be at these events too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/25/journey-mozambique-mabu-forest-julian-bayliss-google-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-25T21:00:12Z","webTitle":"‘Who knows what we’ll find next?’ Journey to the heart of Mozambique’s hidden forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/25/journey-mozambique-mabu-forest-julian-bayliss-google-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/25/journey-mozambique-mabu-forest-julian-bayliss-google-earth","fields":{"headline":"‘Who knows what we’ll find next?’ Journey to the heart of Mozambique’s hidden forest","bodyText":"The soggy boots of the team slide backwards in the black mud as they struggle up towards the ridge line separating the forest edge from one of the last unexplored places on Earth. The rain is an incessant barrage of watery bullets firing down through the tree canopy. Thunder crashes. Tangles of vines and spider webs make for a Hollywood movie scene of truly impenetrable jungle. Near the front of the seven hikers is a Welshman carrying a billhook, a backpack almost the same size as him, and what appears to all intents and purposes to be a briefcase. The slope is so steep that the heavy briefcase clatters against the ground at every step, so he swings it in front of him – clonk – like a ship using an anchor to warp out of harbour against the green, vertical tide. He takes two steps up and swings the case up the hill again. Clonk. On this wet March day in Mozambique, Professor Julian Bayliss, naturalist, explorer, fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Entomological societies, is heading deep into the green heart of the Mabu forest for the first time. The forest, also known as the “Google forest” after the way he “discovered” it using Google Earth in 2005, has more recently been called “the butterfly forest”, after the butterflies that congregate around the summit of Mount Mabu at certain times of year. Many of the species since identified here carry Bayliss’s name. These include Nadzikambia baylissi, the sleek little chameleon with the prehensile tail, and Cymothoe baylissi, the graceful forest gliding butterfly, both of which exist only here within the largest rainforest in southern Africa. “One other thing we have discovered on this trip,” shouts Bayliss, with a huge grin over the sound of yet another downpour on another day on another seemingly unending hillside ascent, “Mabu is not flat.” The scientific discovery of Mount Mabu was a huge breakthrough. Working with Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, the Mozambique government’s institute for agricultural research (IIAM) and the Darwin Initiative, Bayliss was sitting at his laptop looking at Google Earth in 2005, when he wondered whether mountains in Mozambique might also harbour some of the species he was uncovering in nearby Malawi. So he and a Malawian botanist named Hassam Patel decided to take a look. As reported by the Observer, over the years Bayliss and the Kew Gardens team have since identified three new species of snake, eight species of butterfly, a bat, a crab, two chameleons and many plants, as well as a trove of rare birds that are critically endangered. However, no one has ever journeyed into the heart of the forest until now. Previous discoveries came from the forest base camp, the peak and a small satellite camp, all on the lower eastern edge. To explore Mabu’s secrets further, an expedition has been undertaken this month by the international scientific and environmental reporting initiative Alliance Earth. The Alliance Earth team’s objectives were to create a 3D map, uncover new species, check on the health of the forest, publish an ethno-botanical study, seek out potential non-timber forest products, produce a feature documentary and film a 360-degree virtual reality experience for museums and science centres around the world, so everyone can explore the mountain’s mysteries. “This is a new species of Dipsadoboa,” Bayliss says, holding the poisonous tree snake with a twinge of obvious concern. As it writhes, he holds it farther away from his torso. “This is currently undescribed, it doesn’t have a name yet.” Stretching out imploringly, the snake tries to reach the perceived safety of my video camera. “To find an actual new species of snake is extremely exciting, and very rare.” He has now found three new snakes in Mabu’s forest. According to Bayliss, on this trip the team have identified at least one new butterfly species, and quite possibly more, once genetic testing confirms them. They have also found a Caecilian, one of the rarest animals on Earth, which is sort of a cross between a reptile and amphibian, and may be a new type of its kind. But these precious finds aren’t the only new discoveries that have him excited. Under a huge tree he airs his wet boots, squeezing his socks dry before putting them on again. “Yesterday was great. We discovered a new waterfall, which is fantastic. We’ve never been here before, and because it’s the rainy season the water was just crashing through the rocks.” More discoveries have come daily, such as the “valley of giants”, an open canyon with a central raised ridge surrounded by the largest grouping of big trees yet found. Their vast trunks stretch upwards like a cathedral, blending into the green nave of leaves hundreds of metres above. These waterfalls, huge trees, deep canyons, and riverside camping spots are important geographical discoveries that Bayliss hopes will help bring tourists here. At times the forest guides are clearly as perplexed about directions as the team, looping round in ever-widening circles in search of a way across the maze of folded valleys, often climbing up and down one punishing ridge after another in order to make headway. Senior hunter turned guide Ofélio Cavalião, 41, and his son Bartolomeo, 26, joined the expedition one morning before breakfast, hiking from their home many kilometres away. They heard through the grapevine that Bayliss had returned and so tracked him down. Cavalião and Bayliss have worked together on every visit he has made to Mabu’s forest. The local hunter and famous scientist have developed a friendship and deep respect for one another. Once Cavalião arrived, the team started to push deeper into the most unexplored parts of the eastern forest, following the tops of the ridges and making better time. Guides such as Cavalião have an intimate knowledge of the area, making the outside “discovery” of Mabu a purely scientific designation. According to him, the local people have benefited from the forest for generations. It even saved their lives during the back-to-back conflicts that started in 1964 with the war of independence against Portugal, before segueing into the civil war that finally ended in 1992. His friend, 38-year-old guide Ernesto André, agrees. He grew up in the forest, sheltered from the ravages of war, with dozens of other people in small forest camps. Not far into the undergrowth, holes the size of unfilled graves are clearly man-made. Standing in one, André explains that these sheltered whole families and were the only way to hide the sounds of crying children from the Portuguese soldiers who tried to hunt them down. On a remote ridge line with another potential new butterfly in his net, Bayliss talks about the future of the mountain. “Every new discovery helps make the case for the mountain to be officially protected,” he says. But time is of the essence. The team finds the forest intact, yet still not officially protected. A recent report in the Guardian told how, despite a two-year ban on timber exports, corruption and organised crime are still stripping Mozambique of forests such as this. According to the independent Environmental Investigation Agency, as much as $130m worth of hardwoods are stolen from Mozambique annually. Much of it is sent to China. Ecologically aware visitors could help build a tourism industry here that protects the forest and benefits the community in a sustainable way, while safeguarding the incredible biodiversity, according to Justiça Ambiental, the Mozambican environmental justice group that has been working at Mabu since 2009 to create and implement an eco-tourism plan for the mountain. The group’s forestry specialist, Rene Machoco, explains that its vision is for Mabu to be legally designated as a community conservation area. André says that before Justiça Ambiental came, his community didn’t think the forest was particularly valuable, “but then it was explained and we knew the truth. The forest is life and the forest is wealth”. Tourism is only one way to help people like Ernesto benefit from their home. Expedition team member Ana Alecia Lyman is a non-timber forest products specialist based in Mozambique who runs Bio Óleos de Miombo. “Non-timber forest products, such as honey or mushrooms, can be sustainably derived from the landscape to generate income in rural communities without jeopardising local biodiversity,” she says. After seeing the forest first-hand, she is enthusiastic and feels that the more people who are engaged in these sustainable value chains, the more local investment there can be in the health of the forest. Under the tree canopy, Bayliss is hunting an elusive butterfly that finally flutters and rests on the leafy forest floor in a scattered beam of sunlight. Butterflies use solar energy to fly. Their wing veins are usually dark in order to channel energy from the sun to engage their muscles. This is why when they are seen slowly folding their wings while perched in the sunlight, they are getting ready to take to the air. But the shy brown butterfly with the spotted wing markings is no match for the speedy scientist from Wales. A deft swing loops the net shut, “I think I got it!” “This is probably a new species,” he says, looking through the net and walking over to a sunny spot. Extracting it gently he examines the wing spots. “This is probably the one we have been looking for.” He looks closer. With a breathless voice he breaks with his usual understatement. “This is very exciting – this is the first time I have ever seen this butterfly.” What else awaits discovery in the remote forest of Mabu’s basin? Potential answers to that question sit snugly in Bayliss’s anchor-like briefcase: motion-sensitive video cameras, the first ever to be deployed at Mabu. Encased in steel boxes and strapped to trees, the four high-definition cameras will be left running at secret locations deep in the foliage for two years. Having finished securing the last camera above a stream, Bayliss washes his hands in the clear water among the mossy rocks, looking satisfied. “Every time we come to Mabu we discover something new. Who knows what we will find next?” The question hangs in the air as he turns around and starts back on the long hike to base camp with his butterfly net in hand, his briefcase empty, and his wet boots squishing merrily.

Around 40GW of solar power was installed last year, meaning there is now a total of 178GW to meet world electricity demand, prompting renewable energy associations to claim that a tipping point has been reached that will allow rapid acceleration of the technology. “For the first time ever in Europe, renewables produced more power than nuclear – and solar power was key in achieving this remarkable achievement,” said Michael Schmela, executive adviser to trade body SolarPower Europe, which compiled the statistics published on Tuesday. Britain led the European solar expansion, with government incentives helping to add 2.4GW of solar resources to the domestic market, and a third to Europe’s overall 7GW of growth. Unofficial sources estimated the British numbers even higher – at up to 3GW – based on an analysis of solar module shipments. “The success of the UK, set to be the largest European market again in 2015, reinforces the evidence that solar power is a versatile and cost-efficient energy source in any climate,” said James Watson, the CEO of SolarPower Europe, formerly known as the European Photovoltaic Industry Association. SolarPower Europe argues that to nudge Europe away from fossil fuels, better market access will be crucial for solar in a new EU energy market design proposal expected next year. Although global growth was impressive, the European pace of development last year slowed to its lowest since 2009, as incentives known as feed-in tariffs were removed across Europe in 2014. Even Germany, the continent’s largest solar market, saw a slight decline in annual installed capacity to 1.9GW, as incentives were cut and market uncertainties increased. There are fears in Brussels of another solar trade spat with China in the offing, with tough import duties slapped on three Chinese firms last week for violating minimum pricing agreements. Some German solar panel manufacturers have suffered from state-subsidised Chinese competition. Industry sources though say that the removal of minimum pricing agreements would lower costs in Europe and boost growth across the sector. China (10.6GW), Japan (9.7GW) and the US (6.5GW) were the three biggest global solar markets last year, with feed-in tariffs, self-consumption measures, tax breaks and net-metering policies all nourishing growth. One unexpected byproduct of the boom has been that the scale of solar panel distribution between utilities and consumer rooftops has started to balance out. In Europe, the report found that around 40% of solar energy in Europe now comes from utilities, while the amount generated by rooftops has fallen to 60%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/sep/30/businesses-ignore-un-sustainable-development-goals-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-30T11:54:33Z","webTitle":"More than half of all businesses ignore UN's sustainable development goals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/30/businesses-ignore-un-sustainable-development-goals-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/30/businesses-ignore-un-sustainable-development-goals-survey","fields":{"headline":"More than half of all businesses ignore UN's sustainable development goals","bodyText":"Businesses are failing to work on the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), according to two new surveys, despite being billed as having a key role to play in achieving the ambitious goals. With an estimated investment gap of at least $3tn annually across the SDGs for the next 15 years, private sector involvement is critical if countries are to succeed. Yet fewer than half of global companies plan to engage with the goals, according to Ethical Corporation’s State of Responsible Business 2016 report, which surveyed 2,045 sustainability professionals globally (36% of whom worked for a company or a brand). Meanwhile, a study from sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship found the lack of tangible business action on the SDGs is causing a trust problem among consumers, particularly so-called millennials. Findings showed that despite 81% of millennials believing business has a key role to play in achieving the SDGs, the majority of businesses are not yet acting. This is not surprising, says Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, chairman of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (a not-for-profit organisation focusing on sustainable business), and former deputy UN secretary-general. “[Sustainable business] is a movement that’s still gathering momentum and authority,” he says. “There’s also a realm of difference [between] those who are trying to make sustainability part of their core business strategy and those who still see it as an ‘add-on’.” US engagement low Regionally, respondents in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East are engaging most with the goals, according to Ethical Corporation’s research, with the lowest level of engagement (37%) in North America. US-headquartered businesses are sometimes slower than their counterparts in Europe to embrace UN-sponsored initiatives, says Aron Cramer, CEO of sustainability consultancy BSR, adding they “have a cultural preference to do first and talk later”. “That said, we see a great many [US] companies, such as Microsoft and others, embracing the goals and working towards integrating them into their business strategies.” Developed regions are focusing primarily on climate action (SDG 13), the report finds, while developing regions are prioritising pressing development challenges. SDG four, quality education, came out top in Africa, for example. Climate action was also the most supported goal among corporate and brand respondents (63%), followed by SDG eight, decent work and economic growth (52%), and SDG 12, responsible consumption and production (51%), which was particularly popular among apparel, fast-moving consumer goods and manufacturing companies. SDG one, no poverty, and SDG two, no hunger, were among the least supported goals, scoring 22% and 20% respectively. Integrating the SDGs into business Although it’s too early for practical, widespread business action on the SDGs, companies are doing the groundwork to integrate the goals into their sustainability strategies, according to Malloch-Brown. Building on a sound, established approach to human rights and environmental issues is vital, says Ole Lund Hansen, chief of leadership programmes at the UN Global Compact, before companies determine where their activities have an impact on people, economies or the environment, and prioritise specific goals. From there, businesses need to consider which SDGs reflect their own purpose, review existing sustainable development work in the bigger picture context of the goals, and identify where they stand to make the most difference, says Cramer. Hansen says companies should incentivise every employee to achieve SDG-related targets, including through performance reviews. A report by risk management firm DNV GL highlights 17 companies (including Unilever, Siemens, Marks &amp; Spencer and Danone) taking action on specific SDGs, and concludes that businesses of this kind are ready to take “extraordinary action” to help achieve the goals. The report says these firms are characterised by their ability to see the potential of combining growth and sustainability, form collaborations, use technology to achieve scale and reach, and see the SDGs as a way to achieve competitive advantage. The business it highlights for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), Kenyan telecommunications giant Safaricom, created the mobile money platform M-Pesa, which is now used by more than 25m people in Africa, Asia and Europe. It allows people who struggle to access traditional financial services to send and receive money via their mobile phones, and has provided a springboard for further innovations in renewable energy, healthcare, food and agriculture. For example, off-grid solar company M-Kopa Solar is now providing solar energy to 400,000 customers in east Africa, who pay for the service using M-Pesa. The carrot and the stick Above all, the SDGs must become central to core business goals and investment decisions, according to Unilever CEO Paul Polman, who believes that the SDGs offer the “greatest economic opportunity of a lifetime”. He says Unilever’s “sustainable living” brands (which it defines as those that have integrated sustainability into their purpose and products) are growing 30% faster than the rest of the company. Businesses can expect more laws incentives and deterrents on development-critical issues, says Malcolm Preston, global sustainability leader at PwC. Catalysing further progress on the goals will require a more balanced approach to regulations on investment, particularly renewable energy investments v fossil fuel subsidies, says Malloch-Brown. Policy-makers could also consider making corporate contributions to sustainable development mandatory, says Ashoka’s Archana Sinha. India, for example, has obliged major organisations to donate at least 2% of their net annual profit to charity. “Governments need to put their noses under the hood and understand the type of regulatory environment businesses require,” Malloch-Brown concludes. “If you’re going to let them in [to the field of development] because you need the finance, you can only let them through if they’re not going to be rapacious market-makers, if they’re going to invest in long-term business models.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-26T07:58:54Z","webTitle":"Morocco poised to become a solar superpower with launch of desert mega-project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project","fields":{"headline":"Morocco poised to become a solar superpower with launch of desert mega-project","bodyText":"The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. On the edge of the Sahara desert and the centre of the north African country’s “Ouallywood” film industry it has played host to big-budget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones. Now the trading city, nicknamed the “door of the desert”, is the centre for another blockbuster – a complex of four linked solar mega-plants that, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco’s electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco’s ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower. When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in the world, and the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live next month. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over, but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down. The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies, calculated that the world’s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanity’s power needs for a whole year. The challenge though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required. As engineers put the finishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. The 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east. When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Morocco’s capital city, Rabat, and generate 580MW of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW. Morocco’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn (£6bn) project to make her country’s deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said. “We are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,” el-Haite told the Guardian. “We also used to subsidise fossil fuels which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought; why not?” Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco’s renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each. “We are very proud of this project,” el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.” Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focussed on a steel pipeline carrying a ‘heat transfer solution’ (HTF) that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy-generating turbines. The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten salts that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations, to minimise damage from sand blown up by desert winds. Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017 will store energy for up to eight hours – opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara, and the surrounding region. “The biggest challenge we faced was being able to finish the project on time with the performance [level] we needed to achieve,” said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director. But even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. “We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,” says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Société d’Investissements Energétiques, the national renewable energy investment firm. But he says the project’s ultimate impact will go far wider – even as far as the Middle East. “The [ultimate] objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca.” Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilising effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia, and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal, despite the collapse in 2013 of the Desertec project, a German plan to source 15% of Europe’s energy from North African desert solar by 2050. “We believe that it’s possible to export energy to Europe but first we would have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. “Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and then start exporting.” Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member country’s power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020. In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. This could one day include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. Officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North African region. “We are at the avante-garde of solar,” el-Kadiri says. About $9bn has been invested in the Noor complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and backed by Moroccan government guarantees. Undisclosed energy subsidies from Morocco’s unelected ruler, King Mohammed VI, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers. One month before launch, over a thousand mostly Moroccan workers are still racing to fix electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines. They bustle past in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts against a backdrop of the Atlas mountains. Harnesses with hammers and gloves strapped to their belts swing by their sides. Ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp. For Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from Meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action. “We’ve done the construction and now we will see how these projects look when they start,” she says. “It is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.” A global audience will be watching with interest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/12-ways-environment-development-sectors-work-together-sdgs","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-31T15:55:56Z","webTitle":"12 ways environment and development sectors can collaborate to meet the SDGs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/12-ways-environment-development-sectors-work-together-sdgs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/12-ways-environment-development-sectors-work-together-sdgs","fields":{"headline":"12 ways environment and development sectors can collaborate to meet the SDGs","bodyText":"1 | Think of environment and development as one sector Sectoral thinking is partly what will hinder us from meeting the sustainable development goals. The question is not how these sectors can collaborate, but how they can become increasingly intertwined to reflect the joined-up nature of the goals. A good example is the transformation from marine governance to ecosystem governance that took place in some countries when fisheries and environment ministries were reformed. Tim Daw, researcher – ecosystem services and poverty, Stockholm Resilience Centre, @sthlmresilience 2 | Develop trust Traditionally, we have often seen these two sectors as competing – with the notion that you had to sacrifice environmental quality for development. There has also been some scepticism from those within these two communities about the intentions or approaches of others. Economists have not always been welcomed in environmental circles and there is mistrust when it comes to issues that are important to so many. But we are seeing a more enlightened view. Both sides are working together and appreciating that by doing this we can achieve more than we could by working against each other. Oren Ahoobim, associate partner, Dalberg, @orenahoobim, @DalbergTweet 3 | Use the SDGs as a checklist We all recognise that we need a holistic approach, so perhaps industrial projects (eg dams and mining) could use the SDGs as a design checklist to ensure they do not cause negative impacts elsewhere and are a positive force for good. We use our One Planet Living framework in this way, which could really work for the SDGs. Sue Riddlestone, CEO and co-founder, Bioregional, @sueriddlestone, @bioregional 4 | Create financial incentives There are now 20 million artisanal and small-scale miners worldwide. They are responsible for about a tenth of all gold production, but they also do great environmental damage, accounting for the biggest single use of mercury that poisons land and drinking water supplies. The activity is hard to control as miners are widely dispersed, often operating illegally and in remote places. Last week, the GEF council approved a programme that will design and deploy ways in which miners in eight countries can get loans to switch from mercury. Robert Bisset, head of communications, Global Environment Facility, @robbiebisset, @theGEF 5 | Support social entrepreneurs We need business models where development aid and environmental grants are used to get things started, and then they need to stand on their own two feet as some sort of service or business. Social entrepreneurs are entering the development space with initiatives like this, for example, projects bringing solar power to villages in remote areas help development and address environmental issues. Sue Riddlestone 6 | Educate children about sustainability We need all children and students to know not to support unsustainable solutions, so that when they grow up – perhaps to be engineers or designers – they will discourage solutions that are unsustainable. The rest of us need to adopt this mindset; we can’t think we can have a growing business in a failing planet. Livia Bizikova, director – SDG Knowledge Programme, IISD, @LiviaBizik, @IISD_news 7 | Monitor industrial developments continually As well as the traditional tools used in environmental impact assessments, there is a key need for trustworthy oversight. A factory or mine may be designed to minimise environmental harm but unless someone is there to monitor emissions, standards might slip. This process of safeguarding and achieving the best development outcomes is set out in various documents (such as the African Development Bank’s Safeguard Policy). The key is to ensure they are implemented during and after construction as, unfortunately, when these major projects are operational, development practitioners have little or no influence. There is a key role for environmental NGOs here. Mike Webster, director, WasteAid UK, @michaelgwebster, @WasteAidUK 8 | Host cross-sectoral events I got to know some development NGOs at the UN general assembly and during the SDG process, but now the goals are being implementing, where do we meet up? Maybe the environment and development sectors need to have opportunities to get together more often. Sue Riddlestone 9 | Harness natural resources Virunga National Park authorities have acknowledged that the four million people who live outside the park will not stop entering it to cut down trees (for charcoal), hunt wildlife and graze cattle. The Virunga Alliance has helped install three hydroelectric dams that generate electricity for villages outside the park. Children can now study and women can walk with greater safety at night, and businesses are arriving in the region. The project has begun to promote better relations between the park’s rangers and the local people, while building peace, stability and hope in North Kivu province. By harnessing the natural power of the park, the authorities have made great inroads to protecting its exceptionally rich biodiversity. Alex Jones 10 | Promote context-specific technology In the Maasai village where I live, we now have solar energy installed for lights and charging points, and a solar water pump means children have time to do homework and women can take literacy classes. We have switched to clean cook stoves, using cow dung as fuel, and are about to install proper waste treatment because the wind blows in plastics from across the Mara. We have done this at a village scale, which is now being repeated across the Maasai, while keeping all the cultural elements of pastoralism and a semi-nomadic life. The Maasai may live in a world of no money and little food, but it is a world where the best technology can help ensure the future of an important indigenous people. Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist, UN environment programme, @UNEP 11 | Tie funding to joint development and environmental outcomes The environment and development sectors will need to build on the objectives of each other to attract critical funding. This will require them to rethink and expand their work, but will present the opportunity to leverage each other in developing a larger value proposition. We are working with The Nature Conservancy to develop an insurance product to protect reefs facing the damaging impacts of storms. While the traditional approach to reef protection has been to seek public or donor funding to support biodiversity, there is a big opportunity to increase funding to this critical natural infrastructure by layering in development objectives. The reefs provide crucial protection and tourism for the communities and businesses behind them. Adam Connaker, program associate – innovative finance, The Rockefeller Foundation, @RockefellerFdn 12 | Promote the links between environment and sustainable development Early on, development was focused solely on economic growth, which was often achieved by extracting natural capital. Now there is growing recognition that nature serves as the foundation for development over the long term because natural systems support our food production, clean our water, regulate our climate, and safeguard the Earth’s biodiversity. The SDGs do a good job of integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development.

This building designed by London-based Baca Architects has a unique feature – it floats. Completed this month, the amphibious house was developed as a prototype by Baca and Floating Homes, a manufacturer specialising in flood-resilient housing, in response to a competition launched last year to find a solution to London’s housing crisis. The house is intended to be practical, affordable (a two-bed unit will sell for £200,000) and equipped to deal with floods, by rising with the water levels. Ultimately the company wants to unlock redundant waterways by building on “bluespace” sites – manmade docks, canals and marinas – across London. “Collectively, bluespace has the potential to deliver as many as 7,500 floating homes with minimal disruption to existing communities”, says Richard Coutts, director at Baca Architects. Floating architecture has real potential to help ease some of London’s housing problems, says Alex De Rijke of dRMM architects, which won a competition to design the UK’s first floating villages in London Docklands. “Architecture can only respond to overpopulation by addressing the questions of density, economy and speed of construction,” says de Rijke, “The space of large rivers in urban areas can offer answers to these questions.” Architects and city planners across the world are starting to look beyond the traditional confines of the city, towards building on water as one of the answers to reducing inner-city population density and also developing flood-resilient designs. Global damage to cities from flooding could amount to $1tn a year by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a World Bank report. Floating architecture is nothing new. Traditional floating villages are common in deltas and along the Mekong river in south-east Asia. But integrating age-old designs into a modern city is a different matter entirely. Some cities are further ahead than others. IJBurg is a collection of floating houses built on six artificial islands on IJ Lake in Amsterdam, designed by Marlies Rohmer. It was conceived to deal with the city’s critical housing shortage problem as well as its vulnerability to flooding – more than half of the Netherlands is at or below sea level. The housing is a mix of expensive waterside condos and social housing, with about 30% of the community’s 18,000 houses allocated to low-income residents. When complete, the development will provide homes for 45,000 residents on 10 islands. In Copenhagen, architecture firm Urban Rigger has unveiled floating student housing made from end of life shipping containers. Each Urban Rigger has 12 studio apartments which share a courtyard complete with a BBQ area, bike racks and a kayak landing, and is powered in part by solar energy. Tethered to docks in the city, the first students are due to move at the end of the year and will pay around £500-£600 a month. Over the next decade, the company plans to build 1,000-1,500 containers in “harbour, canal and river intensive cities” across Europe, says founder Kim Loudrup. It’s about “using infrastructure that’s not being used for anything apart from looking nice”, says Loudrop, who admits floating housing is “only part of the puzzle” when it comes to solving city housing crises. The beauty is, he says, that this kind of housing “can be initialised and utilised immediately; it comes in, stays for a period of time and then can move away again.” Building on water isn’t straightforward, however. The recent collapse of the Makoko Floating School in Lagos, one of the most famous examples of floating architecture, shows some of the complexities. The award-winning lagoon structure designed by Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi of Dutch studio NLÉ Works was built to provide a school and community centre to a floating slum in the city but collapsed in June after heavy rainfall. Adeyemi says that the building had been decommissioned for months and was only intended as a prototype. But it led to a row as a local headmaster, Noah Shemede, raised concerns about the viability of the structure. There are also environmental concerns. The need for foundations of many floating buildings to go deep into the river bed, for example, will have an impact on the environment, says Phillip Mills, director of the Policy Consulting Network, and a specialist in water construction. “Foundations or structures within the river could also alter the river bed with silt erosion and deposition elsewhere in the river. The same thing already happens around bridge piers,” he says. Building floating structures can also severely alter the flow of a river such as the Thames and disrupt transport, a spokesperson from the Port of London Authority explains. “What might suit property owners or private developers best is not always best for the city. Londoners have said they want to see the Thames used predominantly for transport or leisure. Any structures in the Thames could impact the flow of the river and create obstacles for watercraft.” However, Lucy Bullivant, adjunct professor of history and theory of urban design at Syracuse University, thinks there are greater environmental consequences building on land – such as the tendency to be more car focused – than on rivers. “Floating designs will create a good anchor point for plants to help foster biodiversity and create habitats for fish and birds.” Building on bluefield sights can be environmentally friendly, according to Mark Junak, director of Floating Homes. He says floating structures such as those at Noorderhaven in the Netherlands have recently been subject to underwater drone surveys to observe whether their construction has negatively affected the ecosystem. According to the research project, the underwater footage “revealed the existence of a dynamic and diverse aquatic habitat in the vicinity of these structures, showing that floating structures can have a positive effect on the aquatic environment”. For London architect Carl Turner, who has designed a pre-fabricated, open-source amphibious house specifically designed to float on floodwater, called the Floating House, climate change means needing to work with water. “You either protect the house or protect the land,” he says. “Creating large-scale flood protection zones is expensive and in itself potentially harmful to the environment. Once breached, homes are left defenceless, as opposed to floating homes that can simply rise with flood waters.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-01T14:32:13Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy smashes global records in 2015, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy smashes global records in 2015, report shows","bodyText":"An upsurge in new wind, solar and hydro plants and capacity saw renewable energy smash global records last year, according to a report on new supply. Some 147 Gigawatts of renewable electricity came online in 2015 - the largest annual increase ever and as much as Africa’s entire power generating capacity. Clean energy investment increased to $286bn (£198bn), with solar energy accounting for 56% of the total and wind power for 38%. Overall, more than twice as much money was spent on renewables than on coal and gas-fired power generation ($130bn in 2015), the REN21 global status report found. Christine Lins, REN21’s chief, said: “What is truly remarkable about these results is that they were achieved at a time when fossil fuel prices were at historic lows, and renewables remained at a significant disadvantage in terms of government subsidies. For every dollar spent boosting renewables, nearly four dollars were spent to maintain our dependence on fossil fuels.” For the first time, emerging economies outspent richer nations in the green energy race, with China accounting for a third of the global total. Jamaica, Honduras, Uruguay and Mauritania were among the highest investors, relative to their GDP. African and Latin American countries also set some of the world’s most ambitious targets for clean energy deployment last year, the report says. But the renewables revolution stuttered in many developed countries, with the significant exception of the US. In Europe, investment plummeted by 21% after the withdrawal of policy supports, such as clean energy subsidies and binding targets. Despite this, renewables still provide 44% of the EU’s electricity capacity, and 15% of its final energy consumption. Jean-François Fauconnier of Climate Action Network Europe said the report should be a “wake up call” to the European commission, spurring increased 2030 renewable goals in a review later this year. “The EU is at risk of missing the ongoing energy revolution and lagging behind other leading economies for decades,” he said. The UK saw a 25% rise in renewable energy investments last year, the paper finds. But figures for the first quarter of 2016 suggest this may not survive cuts to solar subsidies and a slowdown in onshore wind planning approvals. Industry reactions to the REN21 paper were buoyant, with the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) hailing news that 173 countries now have renewable energy targets. Steve Sawyer, GWEC’s secretary general said: “A record 63.5 GW of wind power was installed worldwide in 2015, demonstrating the maturity of the sector; and showing how renewables are supplying competitive, reliable and clean energy to fuel economic growth and cut CO2 emissions.” Around the world, 8.1million people are now employed in the clean energy industry - excluding hydropower - 3.5 million of them in China. In the US, more people now work in the solar industry than in oil and gas extraction. While employment in the clean energy sector grew by 6% in 2015, jobs in the oil industry contracted by 18%, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations, and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels. Arthouros Zervos, the chair of REN21 said: “The renewables train is barreling down the tracks, but it is running on 20th-century infrastructure – a system based on outdated thinking where conventional baseload is generated by fossil fuels and nuclear power.” A build-out of decentralised and community-based generation was urgently needed to accelerate the clean energy transition, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2016/jul/28/the-switch-chris-goodall-review-solar-power-taking-over","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T13:59:08Z","webTitle":"The Switch by Chris Goodall – solar power is finally taking over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/28/the-switch-chris-goodall-review-solar-power-taking-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/jul/28/the-switch-chris-goodall-review-solar-power-taking-over","fields":{"headline":"The Switch by Chris Goodall – solar power is finally taking over","bodyText":"A sense of drift and apathy has pervaded the global warming and renewable energy debate for too long. The fossil fuel companies continue to dig coal and pump oil and gas; herbivorous idealists, scientists and ecowarriors emit their ritual opposition. The carbon load forced into the atmosphere continues to rise, and the general public seems resigned. But 2016 is the year this will really begin to change. Chris Goodall’s book is wonderfully up to date but, thanks to the pace of change, even he couldn’t keep up with the avalanche of news and initiatives conspiring to justify his subtitle. In May, Shell announced a major move into renewables; on 15 May Germany received almost all its electricity from renewables; for four days from 7 to 10 May Portugal did the same. Goodall, who is an economist rather than a technologist or ecowarrior, explains why the change is happening now: the cost of solar electricity is falling much faster than anyone predicted. Solar power is approaching parity with fossil fuels and can only become cheaper as time goes by. Sunny Portugal might run fossil-free for four days but what happens when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind refuses to blow? The recent Ren21 global status report, while reporting that clean energy investment in 2015 ($286bn, or £217bn) was more than double that for fossil fuels ($130bn, or £99bn), added the rider: “But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels.” In the latter part of the book Goodall addresses this, explaining the missing factor – the final piece of the puzzle. Goodall writes that the sun supplies enough power in 90 minutes to meet the world’s total energy needs for a year. When solar and wind installations reach a certain critical level, there will be periods when they produce far more energy than can be used. Electricity cannot itself be stored but that surplus electricity and indeed sunlight itself can be used to create liquid hydrocarbons for fuel, plastics and other chemicals and methane to drive gas-fired power stations at times when renewable output dips. This is not a pipe dream. An exciting project, launched as the Global Apollo programme in 2015 and taken up, thanks to Bill Gates’ ministrations, by 20 major governments at the Paris climate conference in December 2015, is to produce liquid fuels and methane directly from carbon dioxide using sunlight – in effect, mimicking the photosynthesis that every plant accomplishes so easily. David Attenborough, one of the founders of the Global Apollo programme, has said: “If we could put a man on the moon in 10 years you mean to say we can’t solve the problem of getting one 500th part of the energy from the sun? It’s really a tiny technological problem.” It isn’t quite such a tiny problem, but lab scientists such as Peidong Yang at Berkeley and commercial companies such as LanzaTech in the US and Carbon Recycling International in Iceland are already showing the way. The surplus solar energy of summer will be squirrelled away into liquid fuel and gas for winter, rather as the sun’s past bounty produced the surplus we now consume as fossil fuels. And this project has the backing of scientists, technologists, economists, governments, great foundations, major investors and even giant energy companies from the fossil era (because the liquid fuels and gas will use the existing infrastructure: a huge economic boon). The “switch” is coming. It will probably take 20 years to make a major impact, but we should see the first fruits very soon. This book is the essential guide to this great benign change, although I could have done with some sense of the grandeur of what we are on the verge of achieving. For 4.5bn years, light has been pouring down on the earth, creating and sustaining the cornucopia of life. For two and a half centuries we have been living off hundreds of millions of years of stored sunlight. And for over half a century, scientists have been working to unlock the secrets of plant photosynthesis. This is now known down to the last atom, and this achievement should rank with Watson and Crick’s elucidation of the DNA structure. It’s time to put that knowledge to work for us. • To order The Switch for £8.19 (RRP £9.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&amp;p over £10, online orders only.

The American Legislative Exchange Council – Alec – is a neoconservative organisation with close links to members of the Tea Party movement. Championed by supporters of the free market, it has been attacked by critics for exerting a “powerful and undemocratic” influence on US politics. It is part funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, David and Charles, whose empire spans mining, chemicals and finance. Leadsom’s links to the council will be scrutinised closely by those trying to gauge her political leanings. In the US the council produces hundreds of putative bills that it seeks to have made into law by US legislators who attend its conferences, where they are treated to generous corporate hospitality at lavish cigar parties. Alec has built a web of relationships with politicians around the world. In the UK these include the Ukip MEP Roger Helmer and the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, who played a large part in the Vote Leave campaign. The council, which promotes privatisation and seeks to curtail union power, is fiercely opposed to the European Union and regularly meets European politicians who seek to check the power of the union, fearing its ideas could spread across the Atlantic. Alec’s national chairman, Earl Ehrhart, warned in 2005 that “the threats posed by the European constitution can easily be transported over here – the threats to free trade, free markets and individual liberty”. Such measures, Alec claims, would hurt American business and stifle job creation. But its critics disagree. “Alec has clearly set its sights on promoting its agenda in Europe and in particular it has targeted politicians from the UK,” said Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy in the US. “Austerity under the Alec vision for the world is far more extreme than anything that the UK has seen under Cameron.” Filings with the Electoral Commission show that in 2008, two years before she became an MP, Leadsom attended “exchange meetings” with Alec in Washington and Chicago. Alec picked up the £1,800 bill. Mark Pocan, a US legislator who attended the 2008 conference, recounted how guests were told that global warming was “a huge, huge myth”. “At least two workshops addressed this issue,” he wrote in an account of his experiences, “one titled Taking the Politics Out of Science, and the other about New Energy Technologies in a Carbon Constrained World.” The first workshop tried to point out inaccuracies about global warming and other “junk” science. The second was designed to talk up “clean coal” options and to make the point that CO2 emissions are “not all bad”. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth US, said: “Alec has been behind some of the most anti-environmental climate regulation attacks in the US for quite some time. “They’ve tried to pass anti-science legislation at the state level which would ban officials from talking and addressing climate change, they’ve attacked renewable energy standards to promote wind and solar energy efficiency, and they have worked to increase and prevent any kind of regulatory action against the oil and gas industry.” In the year that Leadsom attended the council’s conference it was promoting a notorious bill across US states. The “Stand Your Ground” law, backed by the National Rifle Association, which gave gun owners new rights to protect and defend themselves, was heavily criticised following the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager in Florida. Alec’s support for the law ultimately led to the departure from the council of high-profile corporate members such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America and General Motors. Of its former relationship with Alec, the Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, has declared: “I think the consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake.” Transparency campaigners called on Leadsom to distance herself from the council. “It’s a powerful and profoundly undemocratic force in US politics,” said Tamasin Cave, of Spinwatch. “Why did Leadsom get involved with this lot? Who invited her, and why?” A spokesman for Leadsom declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/nov/04/adam-liaw-five-scientific-developments-that-will-change-the-way-we-eat","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-03T20:27:45Z","webTitle":"Adam Liaw: five scientific developments that will change the way we eat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/nov/04/adam-liaw-five-scientific-developments-that-will-change-the-way-we-eat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/nov/04/adam-liaw-five-scientific-developments-that-will-change-the-way-we-eat","fields":{"headline":"Adam Liaw: five scientific developments that will change the way we eat","bodyText":"Bacon-lovers wailed and gnashed their teeth last week when processed meats were declared carcinogenic, but that’s not the half of it. Here are five recent scientific developments that will have an enormous impact on the way people eat. The WHO v red meat The World Health Organisation announced last week that processed meats were now considered category 1 carcinogens alongside alcohol and cigarettes, but it’s the footnote to that story that will have bigger consequences for the future of our diets. It labelled all red meat a category 2A carcinogen, and from the WHO that is BIG. All the commercials we grew up with touting the iron content and health benefits of lean red meat aren’t going to be quite the same if they have to add “and will probably give you cancer” at the end. Health-conscious paleo dieters may even want to rethink their obsession with grass-fed beef, or risk prioritising their summer beach bodies over avoiding bowel cancer. For most of us (myself included), the taste of a good steak or chop is enough to make us not worry too much about ill health effects, but still, after decades of red meat clawing its way into first-world life as an everyday food, the case against it is building faster than ever. The fat taste Say hello to oleogustus. That’s the proposed name for the “fat taste” that looks set to be added to salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami to take the number of basic human tastes to six. The idea that humans can taste fat may seem straightforward, but most of what we associate with fat is its texture or aroma. That most of us can taste it without those other aspects is a big deal. Oleogustus gives us the delicious, morish taste of butter and it helps us tell if oils have turned rancid. Still not impressed? Well, the last time we added to our list of basic tastes was more than 100 years ago, when Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda discovered umami, the savoury “fifth taste” that revolutionised the food industry from potato chips to stock cubes. Oleogustus probably won’t be as revolutionary as umami, but it might lead to better-tasting butter, or more convincing natural or artificial flavours. It might give us richer, creamier-tasting milk, or even Willy Wonka-esque pills that taste like a three-course dinner. Your microbiome If you’ve ever felt not quite yourself, it might be because, scientifically speaking, you’re actually not. Everyone carries around billions of bacterial cells in their stomach and intestines – some bad, but many good – and these cells substantially outnumber our own human ones. Together they are known as our microbiome, and there’s a growing consensus in science that they plays an enormous role in our health. Irrespective of how healthy we try to be, our microbiome may be responsible for whether we are skinny or fat, how prone we are to diabetes, or our food allergies. A course of antibiotics you took as a child to fix a simple lurgy might have inadvertently knocked about your gut bacteria and set you up for a lifetime of weight gain and health problems. The more important the microbiome becomes, the less we will want bacteria-killing preservatives, and we will probably want to return to more traditional fermented foods common in relatively healthy countries such as Japan and Korea. It may even mean a huge boom in supercharged probiotics. Imagine a daily glass of bacteria-filled milk that could help you lose weight or manage serious illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease. GMO safety Since their introduction to our food systems in 1996, genetically modified organisms have been controversial. Most opposition has been around the idea that we don’t know enough about the long terms effects of GMOs to consider them safe. In late 2014, a study at the University of California, Davis, analysed 29 years of data from more than 100 billion livestock animals eating trillions of meals of GMO feed. It broadly concluded that GMO feed was safe and nutritionally identical to non-GMO feed. Of course this was not a study on humans, but up to 90% of GMOs produced are used as animal feed, so it is hugely relevant. The study further suggested there were no adverse affects from humans who consumed meat and other products from the GMO-fed animals. Whether you consider this to be conclusive proof that GMOs are safe or not, it’s a huge step towards eroding the fear that we don’t know enough about them. This may make it less likely that GMO-containing foods will be subject to mandatory labelling and more likely that we will see more GMO foods for human consumption. And if we get really comfortable with GMOs, who knows? Anyone for glow-in-the-dark fish and chips? Throwing out the ‘food pyramid’ Many of us grew up being taught some version of the “food pyramid” – a simple visual guide that promoted breads and cereals as the foundation of a healthy diet, with fats at the pointy end. It wasn’t perfect, but was persuasive for generations of people striving for a healthier diet. Now the 20th century food pyramid is a relic of the past. The US dumped its pyramid for the MyPlate guide in 2011. Australia’s Healthy Eating Pyramid has undergone a drastic revision, with fruit and vegetables replacing carbohydrates as the basis of a balanced meal. In June, Public Health England’s scientific advisory committee on nutrition released the results of its seven-year study into carbohydrates and health. Those results put sugar squarely in the crosshairs, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that rather than fat, the more problematic elements of our diet involve refined sugars and other processed carbohydrates. It has already prompted calls for amendments to the UK’s Eatwell Plate. The rise of anti-sugar thinking has all but obliterated the influence of low-fat-high-sugar “health” foods of the late 20th century, but our dependence on processed carbohydrates has been much harder to shake. How we end up doing so may well be the most significant impact on the way humans eat that we have seen in a thousand years. Substituted dishes such as cauliflower “rice”, zucchini “spaghetti” and bunless hamburgers mimic the form, if not the function, of a traditional carbohydrate-based diet. But these stop-gap dishes are unlikely to persist for too long, and as we become more comfortable with reducing the influence of refined carbohydrates in our diet, traditional foods that go back centuries may find themselves out of date. So much of the way we think about food is with carbohydrates at the base. Pasta, rice, bread and potatoes were the foundation for our idea of health, but also for our culinary culture. What will modern Italian food look like if pasta is marginalised? What about a packed lunch if sandwiches are considered less than ideal? Reducing refined carbohydrates isn’t just for health nuts any more, and that means big changes are coming to the very core of our cuisine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/25/ikea-starts-selling-solar-panels-in-uk-stores","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-25T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Ikea starts selling solar panels in UK stores","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/25/ikea-starts-selling-solar-panels-in-uk-stores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/25/ikea-starts-selling-solar-panels-in-uk-stores","fields":{"headline":"Ikea starts selling solar panels in UK stores","bodyText":"Solar panels will join tea lights and spider plants on sale at Ikea stores from Monday, despite huge government cuts to solar subsidies for homeowners. Shoppers will be able to order panels online and at three stores, initially Glasgow, Birmingham and Lakeside, before the so-called Solar Shops appear in all the Swedish company’s UK stores by summer’s end. Ikea’s new foray with energy company SolarCentury marks its second attempt to sell solar panels, after a two-year pilot with Chinese company Hanergy ended last year. The company maintains that despite low wholesale electricity prices and ministers’ 65% cut to solar incentives, after which new solar installations have crashed in the past two months, the technology makes sense for British householders. “Obviously the climate has been changing in the past year in the UK but, nonetheless, our research showed a third of homeowners would really like to invest in solar, and the majority of those are driven by the opportunity to save money,” said Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability at Ikea UK and Ireland. “Even though the feed-in tariff rate has come down, you’re still going to get a 6% rate of return on a solar installation, you’re not going to get that return on an ISA.” She admitted it was “depressing” to see the recent 75% fall in solar power capacity installed by homeowners but said “we see solar as the future”. Research by Ikea found of the one-third of people who wanted solar, 60% did so because of savings on electricity bills, and that the average solar install should cut buyers’ electricity bills by half. A typical system for a semi-detached house with 10 panels would cost from £4,550, the company said. The partnership with SolarCentury differs from its previous one with Hanergy, in which the troubled Chinese supplier operated what were in effect in-store concessions. This time, Ikea employees will handle sales in stores, and the company expects panels to be installed within six weeks of a buyer’s initial inquiry. Hanergy also only sold panels through Ikea with thin film technology, which Yarrow said only about 5% of the market had wanted, but under the new deal the company will be selling polycrystalline and monocrystalline panels. Yarrow said the latter was more efficient and had a better aesthetic. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s director, welcomed Ikea’s solar venture, saying: “Over the past decade things have changed dramatically as the price has come down and the efficiency, even in cloudy skies, has gone up. Now solar power is widespread enough for most of us to know someone who’s chosen to invest.” Solar energy recently passed an important milestone in the UK when it provided more power than coal to homes and businesses for a day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-06T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Pew survey: Republicans are rejecting reality on climate change | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Pew survey: Republicans are rejecting reality on climate change","bodyText":"Climate scientists have 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming over the past six decades. Their best estimate attributes 100% of global warming since 1950 to human activities. 90 to 100% of climate scientists and their research agree on this. Human-caused global warming is as settled as science gets. Yet most Americans don’t realize it. Moreover, the more conservative a person’s ideology, the less likely they are to accept this scientific reality or to trust the scientific experts. According to a new Pew Research Center poll, just 48% of Americans realize that the Earth is warming mostly due to human activity. Highlighting a vast partisan reality gap, 79% of liberal Democrats and just 15% of conservative Republicans answer the question correctly. Science knowledge matters for Democrats, but not Republicans Among social scientists, there’s an ongoing debate about whether facts can change peoples’ minds on scientific issues that have become politically polarized, like climate change. There’s some evidence that when conservatives have more scientific knowledge, it just gives them more tools to use in rejecting the scientific information that conflicts with their ideological beliefs. Pew asked a variety of general science questions to test the correlation between scientific knowledge and acceptance of human-caused global warming. Overall, Democrats and Republicans got the same average score on these scientific questions, although liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans scored better than moderates in both parties. When it came to understanding that humans are causing global warming, Pew found that scientific knowledge makes a huge difference among Democrats, and no difference among Republicans. However, previous research has shown that conservatives with climate-specific knowledge are more likely to accept climate realities. For Democrats, ideology isn’t a factor because the main solutions to the problem (e.g. regulations and pollution taxes) don’t conflict with their ideological beliefs. Thus scientific knowledge determines whether they understand that humans are causing global warming. For three-quarters of American conservatives, their ideology prevents them from accepting that reality, regardless of their scientific literacy. Republicans distrust climate science experts The expert consensus on human-caused global warming poses a conundrum for conservatives. People usually defer to the experts, in particular on complex issues like climate science. How can they square an ideological opposition to climate change solutions with the 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming? The Pew survey suggests that conservatives accomplish this by denying the expert consensus, and by distrusting the experts. The poll asked whether respondents thought that “almost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change.” Only 27% of Americans were aware of this fact, including just 55% of liberal democrats, 29% of moderate Democrats, and 15% of Republicans. When asked if climate scientists can be trusted to give full and accurate information on the causes of climate change, only 39% of Americans answered yes, including 70% of liberal Democrats and 15% of conservative Republicans. More than half of conservative Republicans also said that climate scientists’ research findings are influenced by the desire to advance their careers and their political leanings. In short, when experts tell you something you don’t want to believe, reject their conclusions by accusing them of bias, as we saw conservative Australian senator Malcolm Roberts do recently on Q &amp; A: Conservative media and politicians created an echo chamber of denial Research has shown that American conservative media outlets like the Wall Street Journal and Fox News are terribly inaccurate and biased in their climate change reporting. In fact, a study in 2013 found that conservative media consumption decreases viewer trust in scientists and belief that global warming is happening. The Pew survey results further reinforce that finding. Moreover, a study published last year found that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that rejects the need to tackle climate change. This is likely due to the party’s reliance on fossil fuel industry campaign donations. Humans are causing global warming. Scientific experts agree about this. Smoking causes lung cancer. Gravity is real. Humans landed on the moon. These are all statements that reflect the reality we all live in whether we’re politically liberal or conservative. Political ideology should not determine whether we accept these realities. And yet in America, on climate change, it does. The Republican Party has created an echo chamber in which their media and political leaders live by the phrase jokingly uttered by Mythbuster Adam Savage: Republican voters take their cues from party leaders and often get their information from conservative media outlets. On climate change, those leaders and media sources reject reality and substitute their own denial and misinformation, because it benefits them. Their voters become misinformed as a result, and thus don’t demand change from party leaders. Everybody outside the denial echo chamber is puzzled by it, and since it’s impervious to external facts, few know how to break through. Piercing the echo chamber Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe has been trying to make a difference by identifying commonalities with many conservatives, like her evangelical faith. There are glimmers of hope in the Pew survey. For example, there’s bipartisan support for wind and solar energy, with 83% and 89% of Americans in favor, respectively. As Hayhoe noted in her climate event with President Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio this week, Texas produces the most wind power of any state, generating 10% of its electricity from wind. Because they’re becoming increasingly cheap and popular, clean technologies are giving us a shot at preventing the worst consequences of climate change. Much like climate change, science denial poses a long-term threat to the Republican Party. And similar to alcoholism, denying the problem doesn’t make it go away; if you don’t accept the problem and take steps to deal with it, reality will eventually come crashing in with disastrous consequences. There are conservative thought leaders who realize this and are in a battle with the science-denying wing over the future of the Republican Party. With reality on their side, they will eventually win; hopefully before too much irreversible damage is done to the party and to the Earth’s climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Could this be the world's most efficient solar electricity system?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system","fields":{"headline":"Could this be the world's most efficient solar electricity system?","bodyText":"A new solar electricity generation system that developers claim is the most efficient in the world, is being tested in South Africa’s Kalahari desert. The Swedish company behind the project - which combines military technology with an idea developed by a 19th-century Scottish engineer and clergyman - says it is on the verge of building its first commercial installation. In the remote Northern Cape province, huge mirrors reflect the sun across the brown Kalahari sand. This is the test site for Swedish company Ripasso, which is using the intense South African sun and local manufacturing know-how to develop their cutting-edge kit. “Our whole team in South Africa has been hired locally, and our new systems have all been built with local South African labour. It works great,” says CEO Gunnar Larsson. This is one of the few operational small-scale concentrated solar energy systems of its kind in the world. 34% of the sun’s energy hitting the mirrors is converted directly to grid-available electric power, compared to roughly half that for standard solar panels. Traditional photovoltaic panels are able to turn as much as 23% of the solar energy that strikes them into electricity, but the average output for most systems is about 15% directly usable by the grid. Jean-Pierre Fourie is Ripasso’s South African site manager. His crew has been testing the system in the Kalahari under harsh desert conditions for four years. “What we hope is to become one of the biggest competitors for renewable energy in the world.” The massive 100 square metre dishes slowly rotate, following the sun. Light clicks and taps fill the still desert air as they constantly adjust to capture the maximum solar energy. Independent tests by IT Power in the UK confirm that a single Ripasso dish can generate 75 to 85 megawatt hours of electricity a year - enough to power 24 typical UK homes. To make the same amount of electricity by burning coal would mean releasing roughly 81 metric tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Paul Gauche, director of the Solar Thermal Energy Research Group at the University of Stellenbosch has visited the test site many times. “The technology looks good to me. I’ve seen it working and I believe it meets the efficiency goals. The technology is proven with years of performance in the navy.” He points out that it will be crucial to keep costs low enough to compete with photovoltaics, a significant challenge as their price falls every year. The system is also limited in that it is only useful in areas with consistent bright sunshine. The technology works by using the mirrors as giant lenses that focus the sun’s energy to a tiny hot point, which in turn drives a zero-emission Stirling engine. The Stirling engine was developed by Reverend Robert Stirling in Edinburgh in 1816 as an alternative to the steam engine. It uses alternate heating and cooling of an enclosed gas to drive pistons, which turn a flywheel. Because of the material limitations at the time, the advanced stirling engine that Ripasso uses was not commercially developed until 1988, when Swedish defence contractor Kokums started making them for submarines. Larsson worked in the Swedish defence industry for 20 years and realised what a clean and efficient generator could mean for renewable energy systems. He wanted to bring the technology from the depths of the ocean into the sunshine, so he resigned as CEO of Kokums and licensed the technology to start Ripasso. “When I founded the company in 2008 my youngest son came to me and said, wow daddy I am so proud of you, now I can tell everyone what you are doing, you are going to save the world instead of destroying it.” The project has not been without its troubles. “Our major challenge over the last couple of years has been to get the technology accepted by the financing community, especially from the banks,” says Larsson. Although banks have been unwilling to finance such novel technology, Ripasso has now secured private funding to begin their first large-scale installation. “We are very ready to head into the commercial phase,” says Larsson.

At an oil and natural gas conference in North Dakota on Thursday, just minutes after he had celebrated hitting the 1,237 delegate mark needed to formally clinch the party’s nomination, Trump gave a speech on energy policy that was largely shaped by advice from Kevin Cramer, a US representative from the state. In a press conference before the event, Trump praised the advice of oil tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm and Cramer then introduced him onstage. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club environmentalist group, was taken aback by Trump’s address. “I have never heard more contradiction in one hour than I heard in the speech,” he told the Guardian. “There are pools of oil industry waste water that are deeper than Trump’s grasp of energy.” Trump gave the speech – which Brune also called “a jumbled collection of oil industry talking points that are devoid from reality in the market place” – in a packed arena that generated an atmosphere more like that of a campaign rally than a staid industry conference. As he hit a number of familiar talking points, a crowd filled with his supporters raised chants of “build the wall”. He did not directly address manmade climate change, which he has in the past called a hoax invented by the Chinese, but he took veiled shots at those who are concerned about global warming. In addition to his pledge to pull out of the Paris climate deal, Trump promised to only work with “environmentalists whose only agenda is protecting nature” and to “focus on real environmental challenges, not the phony ones”. He contrasted this approach with that of Hillary Clinton, whose plan to combat climate change he called “a poverty expansion agenda”. Trump also attacked renewable energy sources, claiming that solar energy was too expensive and attacking wind turbines for “killing eagles”. Without outlining any policy specifics, Trump argued for a focus on clean water and clean air. In January, asked by the Guardian about the Flint water contamination crisis, he said: “A thing like that shouldn’t happen but, again, I don’t want to comment on that.” On Thursday, Trump also made a unique argument about the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would pump shale oil from Canada into the US. Republicans have long supported the pipeline, which was opposed by environmentalists and cancelled by the Obama administration. In exchange for his approval of the pipeline, Trump said, the US would need a “significant piece” of its profits. Shortly after that statement, though, Trump said: “The government should not pick winners and losers.” Trump also seemed unsure whether high oil prices were good or bad. Although at one point in his speech he took credit for oil hitting $50 a barrel, he later enthused about the need for cheap energy. The crowd in Bismarck did not seem confused, though. Cheering wildly, they gave Trump a spontaneous standing ovation. “I will give you everything,” he promised them, adding: “I am the only one who will deliver.” They seemed to believe it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/27/green-energy-industrial-scale-wyke-farms-cheddar","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-27T04:00:22Z","webTitle":"The west country cheddar maker powered by solar and cow dung","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/27/green-energy-industrial-scale-wyke-farms-cheddar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/27/green-energy-industrial-scale-wyke-farms-cheddar","fields":{"headline":"The west country cheddar maker powered by solar and cow dung","bodyText":"“My grandparents used to tell me that if you look after nature, then nature will look after you,” says Richard Clothier, managing director of Wyke Farms, which generates electricity, gas and heat from renewable sources. “It’s nice to go to work in the morning and know you are doing the right thing.” The dairy business in southwest England, which exports 14,000 tonnes of cheddar a year to more than 160 countries, has been building an energy generation and water recycling operation over the past five years to reduce its environmental impact and save money. According to Clothier, it’s been able to lower its energy bills by nearly £100,000 per month as a result. Aside from solar panels, Wyke generates electricity and heat from cow dung. Using microbes, the dung is broken down to produce biogas, which the farm burns to generate electricity and heat. Since dung naturally releases methane during decomposition, the process of producing biogas helps the farm cut the amount of methane – a potent greenhouse gas – reaching the atmosphere. In addition, the cheese maker converts some of the biogas into biomethane, the majority of which it sells to businesses – including the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s – via a local utility’s pipelines. Wyke’s reliance on solar and biogas isn’t unusual for an agricultural business. What sets Wyke’s plan apart is its scale and complexity. The company is putting in place software to monitor energy generation and wastewater recycling, which can figure out the business’s needs and adjust the energy generation accordingly. What’s more, the company – which invested £5m in biomethane generation – is taking a risk by counting on signing up customers willing to pay more for low-carbon energy when natural gas remains abundant and cheap. “Perhaps [Wyke will prove to] have the foresight that pays dividends over the long run,” says David Babson, a senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US nonprofit science advocacy group. “I hope that’s the case because you want to establish policies that incentivise the right behaviour.” While it’s difficult to say for certain when the biomethane business will start to deliver a return, Clothier hopes the payback period won’t be more than five or six years. To build its alternative energy operation, the dairy business has borrowed £11m from Barclays and put in £2m of its own money to cover the cost of planning, equipment, wiring and electric grid upgrades. Wyke can use the government’s renewable energy incentives to defray costs but it would get greater benefits by storing and using the renewable energy it generates on-farm because buying electricity from a local utility would cost 7.5 pence more per kilowatt-hour, says Clothier. As a result, Wyke is looking to boost the farm’s solar energy generation and adding batteries. The farm is also eligible to receive government incentives for producing biomethane and recovering and using heat from its biogas-fed power plants. The dairy business, which employs 225 people and expects to post about £2m in profit on £75m in revenue this year, hopes to inspire fellow farmers to adopt alternative energy. “I’m really keen to show our farmers what they can do,” says Clothier. “They can start with a couple of solar panels to reduce [their] daytime usage. You can start by doing just a little bit”. Wyke Farms is the 2016 winner in the carbon and energy management category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards."},"isHosted":false}]}}
