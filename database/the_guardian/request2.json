He was getting a ride home from his coach, when their car was pulled over. Raised in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Queens, New York, Smith had a wary view of the police. He worried about the traffic stop of two Black men by a white officer. In the end, nothing happened, thanks to the unflappability of his coach – Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who told the cop he could give a ticket or a lecture, but not both. The officer recognized the 11-time NBA champion and let him go on his way. “It was the first time, as an African American young man, that I had seen someone question authority that fast, that deliberate,” says Smith. Russell, who died last year, left a lasting impression on the rookie. Smith went on to become a two-time NBA champion with the Houston Rockets and an acclaimed analyst on the Emmy-winning TNT show Inside the NBA. Now Smith is sharing reflections on the many role models he’s had in a new book, Talk of Champions: Stories of the People Who Made Me. “I wish I knew all this at [age] 20,” Smith says, “all this different information. I’m trying to give it out. I really didn’t know, I didn’t realize at the time, the amount of people in my life who were so influential around the world. I thought this was normal.” Collectively, he calls them “great people who did great things in their fields.” Smith played high school basketball under standout coach Jack Curran at one of New York City’s premier programs, Archbishop Molloy. He went on to the University of North Carolina, where he was mentored by the legendary Dean Smith. His Tar Heels teammate was none other than Michael Jordan – who was known as “Mike Jordan” back then and drove a blue Monte Carlo, but was already showing his characteristic competitiveness on the court. Smith was frequently on the receiving end of that competitiveness. Yet he also remembers Jordan as kind. As a visiting high-schooler from Queens, Smith felt under the weather in Chapel Hill, and Jordan offered to take him to a local pharmacy. In Sacramento, Russell shared insights on the mindset of a champion, which proved invaluable for Smith years later, on the Rockets’ back-to-back title runs in 1994 and 1995. By that time, Smith had witnessed a teammate’s transformation into a leader – Hakeem Olajuwon, whose conversion to Islam was accompanied by a growth in maturity. After Smith’s playing days had ended, he absorbed lessons from the late Kobe Bryant, including on a charity game to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina; and from his fellow stars-turned-analysts on Inside the NBA, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal. On the show, Smith’s has also appeared alongside Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas, while host Ernie Johnson has been a mainstay throughout. Asked for his NBA finals picks, Smith says, “in the East, I still like Boston. In the West, I like Denver.” He explains his choices: “I think they’re complete, more complete than other teams.” “In order to be champions,” he writes in the book, “you have to believe in things that you don’t see. I have to believe that my teammate is going to be there to help me when I’m on defense and I can’t see behind me. It’s like a faith in God, it can be that deep.” The book addresses the issue of faith, including through the 23rd Psalm. Smith’s mother instilled a love of the psalm in her son. “Whenever I’m in the mood, any kind of mood, I say it, in moments before every game,” Smith says. “It does not say there is not evil, not injustice, not things going on in the world, but how to react when that happens. It’s such a great psalm.” In the book, Smith shares many other life lessons he has learned. One is being a good listener, including when it comes to constructive criticism. It was hard when his high school coach Curran said he wasn’t working hard enough to reach the NBA. Yet he realized there was a motivation behind it, increased his efforts and earned Curran’s unhesitating recommendation that UNC accept his star player. Later in life, listening helped Smith get to know Detroit Pistons great Thomas and learn his side of an infamous moment in NBA history. In 1991, Jordan’s Chicago Bulls upended Thomas’ Pistons en route to their first title. Thomas and the rest of the Pistons refused to shake hands with the Bulls. It left a lasting distaste in Jordan, as captured in the documentary The Last Dance. Smith asked Thomas why he turned down the handshake. Thomas, it turned out, came from an era in which such exchanges between opponents were frowned upon. As the book relates, Smith explained that Jordan embodied a different approach: “He’s a person who, when you beat him, he will shake your hand … Especially if he’s the mountain that you’re climbing.” Smith has had plenty of listening experiences alongside Barkley over their 17 years on Inside the NBA. As detailed in the book, the two have disagreed at times over the issue of policing and the Black community, including during the Ferguson, Missouri, protests in 2014. Smith reprints an open letter he wrote to Barkley during that time and discusses their subsequent, respectful exchange on the show. More recently, in 2020, Smith walked off the set after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Bucks had pulled out of their playoff game in protest at the shooting of Blake, who is Black, just months after the police murder of George Floyd. Smith wanted to show solidarity with the Bucks, but while his action was praised by many, including Russell, it drew criticism from Barkley due to a lack of advance notice. In the book, Smith writes, “please understand that [Barkley] is as responsible as anyone for the voice that I have – and the voice that so many NBA players now enjoy. The fact that Chuck and I are on different sides of the fence on specific topics doesn’t do anything to change this.” Smith calls Barkley and O’Neal “like brothers to me. I’m around them so much, probably more than some family members at times.” He describes his exchange with Barkley in 2020 as an example of how you can “disagree with someone and still love them.” There are poignant accounts of Smith’s family throughout the book, including his parents, Kenny Sr and Annie Mae; and his siblings, Wanda, Gwendolyn and Vincent. He notes that his paternal great-grandfather was a slave, and that even after Jim Crow laws were officially banned, an informal segregation existed in St George, South Carolina, where his family has roots. Growing up in LeFrak City, Queens, had its own difficulties. One night, his father was robbed but stayed composed and emerged with a dollar to take the subway back to his family. When Smith went out of the neighborhood for high school, he endured racist slurs. Yet the diversity of New York also introduced him to other cultures, an experience he continually references as helping him manage life’s challenges. Smith also shares moments with his five children – Kayla, KJ, Monique, Malloy and London – whom he calls “a big part of what I do. I’m influenced by them, just as much as I might influence them. They’re very astute young men and women.” Asked about advice for young people of today who are seeking out role models, Smith replies, “Be a good listener before a good talker. Be good at your craft before you expose your craft. You have to put in the work to be extraordinary, but don’t present yourself as ordinary.” “Extraordinary,” he notes, consists of two words – “extra” and “ordinary.” “Making a shot is pretty ordinary,” Smith says. “Multiple times in a row, that’s extra ordinary, extraordinary. Extraordinary is just doing ordinary things great. If you look at it in that perspective, you won’t feel overwhelmed, like: ‘This is unattainable.’ It is attainable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2023/may/22/50-years-of-pacha-ibiza","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"‘Everything we do is about connection’: 50 years of Pacha and the Ibiza club scene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/50-years-of-pacha-ibiza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/22/50-years-of-pacha-ibiza","fields":{"headline":"‘Everything we do is about connection’: 50 years of Pacha and the Ibiza club scene","bodyText":"The year was 2010, the last vestige of time in which, when the beat dropped in the club, there would be thousands of hands in the air simultaneously cutting through the laser lights instead of holding up little glowing bars to film it. Swedish House Mafia, the superstar DJ trio comprising Steve Angello, Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso, had taken over the world with their euphoric Eurodance bangers, and those who’d managed to get into their residency night at Pacha, the superclub in Ibiza’s Mediterranean Old Town, knew that they were at the centre of the island’s best party. But they weren’t prepared for what happened next. Pacha’s twin cherry logos glowed red and, suddenly, on a platform before the crowd appeared none other than Kylie Minogue, delivering an impromptu reworking of Can’t Get You Out of My Head, the irresistible beats of which now came courtesy of Swedish House Mafia. “It was an explosion. Nobody knew it was going to happen,” says Francisco Ferrer, a local man who started working for Pacha in 1985 selling tickets and would become its global brand ambassador. “You could feel the happiness of people around the room,” he says. “It’s a big memory.” He had devised the performance with Kylie, who enjoyed the club so much she would often go incognito with her friends to dance in the middle of the crowd. Ferrer and I are speaking inside an eerily empty Pacha while technicians tinker away in the DJ booth. In just a few hours’ time, the doors will open to thousands of clubbers for the nightclub’s opening party, heralding the unofficial start of the season. Opening party weekend here is always a big one, but as it’s Pacha’s 50th anniversary, tonight will be particularly exceptional. The anniversary marks not just five decades of the island’s oldest club, but of Ibiza partying itself. When Ferrer was born in 1964, just a few hundred yards away from Pacha, Ibiza was a remote island unknown to many in the rest of Europe. But the seeds of its identity as a hedonistic, free and inclusive paradise had already begun to germinate. Word spread of a mythical white island with irrepressible natural beauty that had become Spain’s unofficial refuge from General Franco’s fascist government. Ibiza soon drew the first hippies and beatniks from the US who were fleeing conscription from the Vietnam war, instead forming free-love communes and throwing raves in the rugged centre and north of the island. In Eivissa Town, across the marina from Pacha, the Calle de la Virgen street was a hallowed LGBTQ+ sanctuary. A young entrepreneur named Ricardo Urgell, having already founded the first Pacha nightclub in Sitges, Catalonia, visited Ibiza in the early 70s and was determined to create the first official discotheque there. Ignoring financial advisers who complained that a bunch of hippies was too small a group of people to cater for, Urgell converted an old whitewashed farmhouse into a party palace and, in 1973, Pacha Ibiza was born. Flower Power, the club’s earliest themed night, is still going to this day – playing 60s and 70s music. Resplendent with daisies and peace signs, the farmhouse once famously played Imagine while an elevated bed made its way through the crowd, upon which languished a pair of joint-smoking John Lennon and Yoko Ono impersonators. At another Flower Power night, Ferrer remembers finding Mick Jagger – the real one – in an empty room. Old Snake Hips was alone, swaying, in the centre of the dancefloor, absorbed in the music. “Do you want something to drink?” Ferrer asked him, tentatively. “No,” Jagger replied. “I’m here to listen to this music. I’m alone here; nobody can disturb me and I can dance and be myself.” By the 1980s and 90s, Ibiza was the island of personalities, and Pacha, as the sassiest, glitziest club, was “the place to be and be seen”. Any celebrity worth their salt partied there. Grace Jones was always cutting shapes while a slew of designers – Armani, Dolce and Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier – and their entourages packed out the VIP booths with gold jewellery and haughty smiles. The concept of a “superstar DJ” did not yet exist, which meant the crowd and the club itself were the spectacle. Palm trees. Chandeliers of fireworks. Confetti explosions. Smoke cannon. Strobe lights. Fire-breathers. And as well as the ravers, there were the go-go dancers: beautiful women and men complementing the aural fiesta. “It was freeness,” recalls Ferrer. “You met a lot of people because maybe you are dancing and meet people next to you, then begin to speak to them, you know? There was no telephone, there was no Instagram. It was natural. Now society is very performing.” By the late 1980s, house music was permeating from the turntables of Frankie Knuckles and Marshall Jefferson in Chicago warehouse raves. These infectious 120bpm sounds soon landed on the shores of the White Isle, where the hedonism of Pacha, Amnesia and Ku Club (the biggest club in the world, later renamed Privilege) had reached its zenith – enough to influence four British blokes to import elements of the scene to the UK. Paul Oakenfold, Johnny Walker, Nicky Holloway and Danny Rampling were blown away in 1987 by the Balearic beats, raves that lasted for days, and their first ecstasy experiences. As soon as they landed back in London they launched their own club nights, Spectrum, Shoom and The Trip, and what happened next is well-worn UK house history: illegal raves, ecstasy, the Smiley face, tabloid hysteria and the 1988 “second summer of love”. The next chapter is considered by many Britons (but perhaps by fewer Spaniards) as the “golden era” of Ibiza – all despite the insalubrious 18-30s package holidays, turbo-shandies on San Antonio’s strip and “Brits abroad” behaviour as captured by the Ibiza Uncovered TV series. The songs of the 1990s are timeless: Café Del Mar by Energy 52; Music Sounds Better With You by Stardust; 9PM (Till I Come) by ATB; Children by Robert Miles; You Don’t Know Me by Armand Van Helden, and; Needin’ U, from Pacha’s resident DJ, David Morales. By then, the aftershocks of the ’Beefa boom were reverberating around the world. The 00s, however, were when Pacha hit its commercial peak. It was one of the first major clubs to book David Guetta, who, despite having now amassed 10 million album sales, was paid for his first sets with the money Ferrer and his crew made from selling branded T-shirts that day. In the first year of the new millennium, Paul Oakenfold was a resident DJ, playing mammoth sets lasting until 9am. And the British invasion was cemented with Darren Emerson’s Underwater nights and sets from Paul Woolford and X Press 2 and Groove Armada. For Simon Dunmore, the founder and former CEO of Defected Records, the label that hosted a summer-long season at Pacha for eight years between 2005 to 2012, the 00s was “the rise of the superclubs”. “It was the early days of the internet, and reputations grew over that period of time because people were way more connected,” he says. Dunmore’s most memorable Pacha moment was in 2001, when Defected had released Roger Sanchez’s Another Chance, which was at No 1 in the UK singles chart. Dunmore describes the goosebumps moment in the club when Sanchez “looped up the beginning of the chords and teased it in for a couple of minutes. “When the record eventually came in, the club just exploded,” he recalls. “The head of music at Radio 1 was there and we ended up hugging each other,” he says, adding: “It’s mad isn’t it, how music brings people together?” The subsequent decade saw previously underground electronic music enter the mainstream, and cemented Ibiza’s reputation as a rite of passage for any dance music fan. Yet the commercialisation of dance saw aspects of the island fall victim to rampant capitalism, notably through eye-watering drinks prices, a ballooning VIP culture and overcrowding on the dancefloors. The balance between Ibiza’s outlaw heritage and modern gloss is an ongoing issue. There are distinctly more private jets and yachts than in yesteryear, but Sanjay Nandi, the CEO of Pacha Group, believes people of all demographics are still attracted to the island. “It’s not possible to fill superclubs entirely with high-net-worth individuals,” he says. Last month, at its 50th opening season party, the Pacha crew and progenitors of those cheeky red cherries were looking ahead to many more decades of decadence to come. Multiplatinum British DJ duo CamelPhat have joined the 2023 residency billing alongside a heterogeneous music programme that includes the desert sounds of Bedouin, the techno of Marco Carola and, of course, the 60s and 70s grooves of the Flower Power night. Yet while Pacha diversifies, Jessica Capaz McCarthy, Pacha Group’s artistic director, argues the club’s ethos will remain the same. “I feel like when you go to a nightclub it’s all about the feeling of connection, and everything we do is about connection,” she says. “That’s what makes people feel like they had the best night of their lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/america-green-energy-obstacles-fossils","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"America’s big shift to green energy has a woolly mammoth problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/america-green-energy-obstacles-fossils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/america-green-energy-obstacles-fossils","fields":{"headline":"America’s big shift to green energy has a woolly mammoth problem","bodyText":"America’s renewable energy drive needs more than a million miles of new transition lines but emerging resistance includes opponents worried about building them in one of the country’s richest areas of ice-age fossils. The Greenlink West project would build a 470-mile-long transmission line bringing clean electricity north of Las Vegas to Reno in Nevada, but it cuts through an area containing everything from woolly mammoth tusks to giant sloths to ancient camels. The pushback has highlighted a major, and growing, challenge to Joe Biden’s attempts to expand clean energy in order to tackle the climate crisis – how to quickly build vast new networks of electricity transmission across America without falling afoul of local communities and green groups. If the US is to eliminate planet-heating emissions by 2050 it will need to increase the capacity of its current 700,000 circuit-mile network of poles and wires by threefold, researchers have estimated, in order to electrify key components of everyday life and shift intermittent wind and solar energy to areas where the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing. The nascent stages of this gargantuan effort, the scale of which hasn’t been seen since the US built out its highway system in the 1950s, is already facing opposition from various conservation groups, locals and fossil fuel interests from New England to the Arizona desert. “Transmission is contentious because it’s long, it’s linear, so it affects a lot of people,” said Jessica Wilkinson, North America renewable energy team lead at the Nature Conservancy. “We are seeing local concerns being raised and they are growing as these projects increase in size. It’s all new to people.” Suddenly, as lawmakers jostle over ways to speed up new projects, local opposition seems likely to grow. “It’s only been energy nerds like me into this, most people haven’t really thought about it,” said Tim Latimer, chief executive of Fervo Energy, a developer of geothermal projects. “But this is the next big barrier to renewables. There really is no transition without transmission.” Those committed to preventing the defilement of valued landscapes are now placed in a conundrum where an unprecedented amount of infrastructure development is needed to protect those landscapes, as well as people, from global heating. Sherri Grotheer, president of the Protectors of Tule Springs Fossil Beds, said that she is “very concerned” about climate crisis but that she wanted federal authorities to come up with an alternative route for Greenlink than slicing through the Nevada monument, which could disturb fossils that are hundreds of thousands of years old. “Sometimes knee-jerk reactions can cause unintended consequences and we know there are innumerable fossils left here, there is evidence of fossils everywhere just under the surface,” she said of Tule Springs, a 23,000-acre monument situated north of Las Vegas protected for its fossils under the auspices of the National Park Service since 2014. “It’s one of the most significant fossil sites in the continental US and maybe beyond,” said Grotheer. “It’s just very cool. I just want them to look at alternative routes. There is also the concern of putting projects like this in national parks, because then you think ‘where does this end?’” For developers of renewable energy projects, however, the lack of transmission capacity is a major headache. Even as clean energy projects have gathered pace, turbocharged by last year’s $370bn in climate spending via the Inflation Reduction Act, they face frustrating waits to be connected to a fragmented, congested electricity grid. The typical wait is now nearly four years, with much longer delays than this experienced by some companies. While the tap of new funding for renewables is now gushing, it risks being wasted due to the lack of a a metaphorical hosepipe. The US Department of Energy has said there is a “pressing need” for new infrastructure, with California alone needing to add more than $9bn-worth of new transmission to avoid rolling power blackouts as wildfires and other climate-driven disruptions mount. “We need to solve this problem if we are going to deal with climate change,” said Latimer. Fervo has been able to establish geothermal projects in Utah and Nevada – tapping into the steam from underground heat to spin turbines – but Latimer said other opportunities have been hampered by the lack of grid opportunities. “I can’t tell you how many places we’ve seen and thought, ‘Wow, the geology is excellent for geothermal, but we just can’t get the transmission,’” he said. “It’s difficult to get private finance for something where you can’t get revenues for nine more years, so you just give up. The system is gummed up but that is just the tip of the iceberg because many people don’t even try to get a spot in the line.” Wilkinson said that smart planning can avoid disturbing valued landscapes and help reduce this tension. A recent report she co-authored found that while an area the size of Texas is needed for new renewable projects and their power lines in the US, this can be shrunk by more than half if sited in an efficient way, avoiding sensitive habitats and prized cropland. “We have the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss and there is an assumption we will need to trade off a lot on the nature side to fix climate change, but that’s not the case,” she said. “Time is of the essence, we need to transition to renewables quickly, but there is a way to do it smartly that can balance conservation and development.” Congress is now grappling with how to speed up the permitting of new transmission projects, as part of the negotiations over the debt ceiling. Republicans and Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat senator, want to weaken environmental impact reviews of new developments, a prospect that environmental groups are wary of as an avenue for fossil fuel projects such as the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a gas project championed by Manchin that gained a key approval from the Biden administration earlier this month. The White House, meanwhile, has indicated it supports expedited permitting, but not a wholesale watering down of environmental laws. “Right now, the permitting process for clean energy infrastructure, including transmission, is plagued by delays and bottlenecks,” admitted John Podesta, a senior Biden climate adviser, in a speech last week. Podesta said he recently learned that a transmission line he thought was approved under Barack Obama’s presidency still hadn’t been resolved. “That’s unacceptable,” he said. “We got so good at stopping projects that we forgot how to build things in America.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/inflation-food-bill-britain-racist-westminster-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"Inflation may be down, but my food bill is shooting up and Britain feels more toxic than ever | Sharron Spice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/inflation-food-bill-britain-racist-westminster-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/inflation-food-bill-britain-racist-westminster-prices","fields":{"headline":"Inflation may be down, but my food bill is shooting up and Britain feels more toxic than ever","bodyText":"Two weeks ago I started a new job, working with young people who are being exploited or at risk of being dragged into county-lines activities. The problem is becoming more prevalent in schools, colleges and pupil referral units (PRU) – children are doing it to other children now. I feel I can help in a positive way. And although I was hoping for a permanent job with holiday pay, this is an ongoing contract initially for three months. But the pay is better than my last job and I’m starting to plan for the future. I want to go on holiday. I haven’t had a holiday since before the pandemic. I had booked to go to Morocco, but it was cancelled during lockdown. Now my passport has expired and I will have to pay £82.50 to renew it; the fee went up in February. I plan to start putting money aside each week. My new job is full time but I don’t have to go into an office every day, so I save a bit of money on travel. I’ve still got my other jobs: my Saturday reparation work, my casual youth work, my evening youth work. It’s a lot, but it’s good because many people are doing that now – I’ve always had lots of jobs so it doesn’t feel like a chore to me, it feels normal. Still, I need a holiday. I need to get out of here. Have you seen the price of butter and everything that’s gone up? It’s crazy. I did some shopping the other day, I spent £100 because I’ve reduced my shop to every two weeks. I have to cook more often now, so I’m back doing that on a Saturday and Sunday. It seems to me that some shops have increased prices during this cost of living crisis out of greed. Inflation is supposed to be going down. The shopping should reflect that but prices keep going up. My rent has gone up as well. My council tax has gone up. My phone bill has gone up. Broadband has gone up. Everything has gone up. Everything about the UK feels so toxic at the minute. I feel as if I’m constantly on edge. With this racist rhetoric that is coming from the government, I can’t help but feel something bad is going to happen. I feel I could be targeted, with the government not condemning it, which is worrying. I don’t feel comfortable. Before, I used to think: “I’m British, I’m here.” Now, I’m not too sure. I’m thinking of comments like Robert Jenrick’s, when he said that “uncontrolled illegal migration” threatened to “cannibalise” the UK’s compassion. What has cannibalism got to do with migrants? Or Suella Braverman reportedly making her views “very plain” to Essex police after they removed golly dolls from a pub. Or the Windrush compensation scheme, which is taking too long. It’s a pressure cooker and it’s going to spill over. I don’t think the government understands the level of hate it has stirred up in its constant attacks on brown people. I am not alone in this. I talk to my colleagues. I talk to my friends. Everybody feels the same. A couple of weeks ago I was in Tesco and there was a guy standing next to me. I didn’t know if he was in the queue or not, so I asked him. He looked me in the face, and chose not to respond. These days, my only conclusion is that he didn’t want to answer me because of the colour of my skin. While I can’t be sure why I was totally ignored, what other reason could there have been? I’ve had to go back to basics in order for me to feel good about my life. I’ve had to say: “Sharron, you’ve got a flat, be grateful. Sharron, you’ve got a job, be grateful. Sharron, you’ve got up today and you’re going out and you’re walking and you can see, you can talk, you’re not ill.” I’ve had to go back and appreciate everything from the basics.

Athleisure-clad political consultants came and went, as if typecast from a political TV drama. The Washington monument poked between buildings in the distance. Williamson is far from an average political candidate, even in the modern era of American politics where it often feels much of what was once unthinkable has become a scary new normal. She is not a politician, but instead an author and wellness guru, whose quixotic first tilt at the White House four years ago was far from successful but saw her grace the Democratic debates and score a viral hit with her message to Donald Trump that she would “harness love” to defeat him. This time around, Williamson is running a tougher, more grounded campaign – treading the turf as a political outsider appalled at how America’s political elites have ignored the needs of its ordinary people. The chances that Williamson will become Democratic nominee for president next year are very slim. But there’s no doubt that her message has the power to resonate, particularly among the young and with women, and with those who feel America’s current travails cut deep and are being ignored. “I’ve had a 40-year-career working with people whose lives are in trouble. When I started that was the exception, not the rule. The work I did then was an adequate response to the suffering I saw in front of me, but now there seems to be a ubiquitous wave of people’s lives falling apart.” Williamson is also increasingly clear on some of the traditional barriers she faces. Williamson, 70, is just the second woman – the first being Republican Nikki Haley – to have thrown her name into the 2024 presidential nomination contest ring. Both have received a seemingly reflexive push-back from their respective parties and some quarters of the media. Sexist? Quite possibly. “An obelisk is much more than a phallus,” Williamson said at her event, observing the monument beyond. And then more directly: “You don’t even know what misogyny is until you’ve been a woman running for president.” But Williamson was less interested in symbols of power than her political agenda. She’s never held public office, though she ran unsuccessfully for California’s 33rd congressional district in 2014, and for the Democratic party nomination in 2019, endorsing Bernie Sanders after dropping out the following year. Among her platform positions is an increase in the minimum wage, reparations for racial injustice, a more muscular response to climate change, comprehensive educational reforms and the creation of a US Department of Peace. She talks of “soulless hyper-capitalism” which she sees as the fundamental affliction of an America run by a government “of the corporations, by the corporations and for the corporations”. Now she’s doggedly upgrading her old messaging about personal growth and universal love, attempting to dig a channel from new age enlightenment to political power, and to turn around what she sees as an economic, environmental and social crisis engulfing America. “I’m socio-economically well-travelled,” she said. “And my experience has had to do with the endurance and transformation of chaos. I’m interested in the principles of truth, and the realization that America is out of control. America is in chaos.” The liberal, Jewish ex-lounge singer from Texas arrived in Los Angeles in the 1980s and began to gather the stars – Madonna, Michael, Liz and Warren – and Hollywood power brokers of the era around self-healing psychotherapy and applied her energy to the Aids crisis. She set up in New York, giving a talk once a month on a Course of Miracles. Her career took off via Oprah Winfrey, and she became known as the TV star’s “spiritual adviser”. A book publishing empire followed. Almost all her titles applied “love” to whatever the title subject at hand. After her first run for the party nomination in 2020 she moved to Washington, which she describes as a walled city, not a bubble. She’d recently gotten out to visit East Palestine, Ohio, after the toxic train derailment turned the sleepy burgh into a byword for chemical disaster at the hands of a big corporation. “The economically oppressed in this country are being oppressed by the same forces, whether on the left or the right. The real divide is not left and right, that’s a veil of illusion, it’s between those who are suffering and those who don’t seem to have a clue. It’s about millions of people living with chronic economic insecurity,” she said. There’s little sign that those actually arranging Democrat political power have much time for Williamson, and they have fenced her out. But she is not put off, touring the country and doing campaign stops. “Why would I capitulate? I’m a 70-year-old woman. I’m not part of that system. I’m not coming from that place of do what they tell you and you might get on that committee or get to run in 2028,” she said. “There’s such a fear of Donald Trump, they assume the best way to go is with Joe Biden. I disagree. You have to be in complete denial to think that status quo, transactional politics are going to be enough to defeat the energy that he [Trump] represents. “People are blinded by their fear of him,” Williamson continued. “They think if they attack him enough people will change their minds. But this a man who said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and supporters wouldn’t care, and I think that’s probably true. “You’ll beat him by offering the American people a better deal, and agenda for genuine economic reform, an economic U-turn.” Integral to that, she said, would be a 21st-century economic bill of rights – universal healthcare, free tuition, free childcare, paid family leave, guaranteed housing, a livable wage and sick pay. Last week, Williamson also announced plans for a Department of Children and Youth, arguing that children, because they have no economic agency and no vote, are “systematically neglected”. “Public policy in America sets children up to fail. Our children are the biggest collateral damage from hyper-capitalism. So I would place a tremendous focus on children, and create a massive transformation of resources. I want every school to be a center of learning, culture and arts.” Students go to school in fear of gun violence, a situation she says that will exacerbate mental health issues in the future. The current debate, she says, doesn’t begin to address the issue. “It’s a sophomoric question, is it cultural or is it guns? It’s both. It’s gun safety laws and the glamorization of violence that people make money off. “Our food policies are violent, our climate policies are violent, our justice policies are violent, our economic policies are violent. The violence perpetrated against women on TV blows my mind – and the emotional violence on social media. We’ve sexualized violence, and we will have a violent society until we chose to become non-violent.” But her message of love and equity could be marred by other reports of the author behind the scenes. Shortly after she announced her run, Politico ran an article claiming she had episodes of “foaming, spitting, uncontrollable rage” during her 2020 White House run. Williamson later called the accusations a “hit piece”. “I raised my voice in the office. They said I threw a phone but I’ve never thrown a phone at anyone. If people feel I’ve been disrespectful to them, of course, I’m very sorry,” she says. Some also detect a political hand. Williamson has claimed the Democratic National Committee is “rigging” the party’s primaries in favor of Biden by ruling out a debate – “candidate suppression if a form of voter suppression,” she says – and the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, responded to questions about Williamson’s candidacy with jokes about auras and crystal balls. “Of course they call me an unserious candidate because they don’t want to be called to the carpet for being so unserious about the things that matter most,” she hit back. “Of course they would see me and those like me as dangerous, because from the perch they’re on I am dangerous.” Politicians love to talk, but none possibly as much as Oprah-trained spiritual gurus turned politicians. And Williamson is now on a tear. Over the past month, 38 videos have gleaned 4m views and more than 600,000 “likes” on Gen-Z popular TikTok. But this may be where Williamson likes to be – firing salvoes, getting her voice out there, offering the damned salvation, slipping on occasion into what sounds like life-coaching. And after the traumatic four-year experiment of allowing a political outsider from the far right to enter the walled city of US politics without knowledge of or care to learn how the levers of political power operate, resistance to another outsider on a political quest is unquestionably elevated. “I can see that it would be an extremely difficult job, and I can’t imagine that it would be fun every day,” Williamson says of the prospect of the presidency. “I would simply try to be as good a person as I can be. I’m not claiming to be what I’m not. I’m running for president, not sainthood. I am a decent woman who has, I feel, some insights about this country and some insights about what is happening that could be of value.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/minorities-extreme-right-wing-groups-ideology","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"The allure of fascism: why do minorities join the far right?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/minorities-extreme-right-wing-groups-ideology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/minorities-extreme-right-wing-groups-ideology","fields":{"headline":"The allure of fascism: why do minorities join the far right?","bodyText":"While investigators search for a motive behind a Texas man’s mass killing of eight people at an outlet mall near Dallas earlier this month, they and groups such as the Anti-Defamation League believe they have uncovered social media posts in which he spewed white supremacist, misogynist and antisemitic rhetoric. Experts say Mauricio Garcia’s apparent expression of hate-filled rhetoric fits into a modest but increasingly alarming pattern of largely men of color drawn to far-right communities. Since the election of Donald Trump, they say, more men of color have taken on leadership roles in far-right and militia groups and participated, and in some cases led, violent protests, most notably during the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. For people of Latino descent like Garcia, who self-identified as Hispanic, the allure of rightwing proto-fascist politics comes from a complex and contradictory cocktail of misinformation within Latino communities, the presence of authoritarian influences from their countries of origin, and a proximity to whiteness in the US that relies more on dominance over people than one’s skin color. In this world, violence is an apt political response to threats to such dominance. “Part of what we’re seeing – not just in the militia groups, but all across, including a clear upsurge of people of color voting Republican party – is that there’s not a necessary connection between racial identity and your beliefs,” Daniel HoSang, professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale University, says. He added: “It is complicated. It means disentangling your presumptions around race and political identity. We had an entire civil rights movement that was grounded on combating laws that were racially segregative. Now, we’re at a moment where it’s a bit more muddy and requires more nuance.” Garcia, who was killed by police, wore a patch on his chest that read “RWDS”, which stands for “Right Wing Death Squad”, a nod to glorifying violence and an allusion popular among far-right and extremist groups to violence by Central and South American paramilitary groups against communists and what they saw enemies on the political left from as far back as the 1970s, the Associated Press reported. The Anti-Defamation League found posts on Russian social media of Garcia with neo-Nazi tattoos and misogynist language, including those used by “incels”, a subculture of men who blame women and society for their inability to form romantic connections, a phenomenon that federal law enforcement sees as a rising threat that could escalate to violence, often against women. “White supremacy itself is not just about membership, about who is and isn’t white,” says HoSang, co-author of the 2019 book Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity. “It comes with a politics and ideology of division … It’s also their beliefs about the nation and of the role of violence in enforcing that hierarchy.” Unlike the white supremacists who rioted in Charlottesville in 2017, men of color attracted to white supremacist ideologies believe less in a white ethnostate and more that the state has failed them in the past and it will take violence to suppress threats and restore their perceived sense of order, HoSang says. Scholars have described their connection to these extremists as the “multiracial far right”. Cecilia Márquez, a history professor at Duke University, was less surprised than others when it was revealed the Texas mass shooter was Latino and had peddled white supremacist views. She has tracked the involvement of Latino people on the white nationalist website Stormfront, particularly since the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, whose mother was Peruvian. Márquez had seen a small but rising number of Latino men, and men of color broadly, being drawn into white nationalist forums and becoming radicalized. Márquez, whose research has found Latino participation in white supremacist groups as far back as the 1980s, described how Latinos on the website would identify as the heirs to the Spanish conquest in similar ways to how white supremacists would relate to Norse or Viking mythology. She added that the internet “made it possible for white supremacists throughout the Americas to be able to talk to each other” in ways that were not possible before, noting that that communication through messaging apps like WhatsApp had “accelerated” not just the spread of misinformation but also of “information designed to radicalize people”. “It felt really, really scary,” Márquez said. The Texas shooter, she added, was “not a single actor. He’s not by himself. He’s part of a growing community of people who are engaged in this kind of thinking, and increasingly this kind of violence.” She emphasized, however, that Garcia’s views represented a fraction of this small population and fixating on him missed the larger story of how Latinos in the US have largely consolidated around Democratic political views. Still, experts say, Garcia represents a paradox of squaring away one’s racial identity with one’s political identity. Like others, Cristina Beltrán, an associate professor who studies race and the right at New York University, emphasized that the experiences and views of Latino communities in the US are not monolithic, and being Latino is one part of a person’s identity. “We know that experience alone doesn’t produce an identity. That is how you interpret your experiences,” Beltrán says. What could also draw young men of color to the far right extends beyond perceived views of racial superiority. Beltrán argued that they could also be drawn to the practice of “domination” that is tied to American history and the subjugation of other groups such as women, noting that it was part of a “history of being able to feel free because some groups are below you”. In a Washington Post op-ed, Beltrán, author of Cruelty as Citizenship: How Migrant Suffering Sustains White Democracy, also wrote that the rise of Donald Trump offered this form of what she called “multiracial whiteness” to far-right men of color like Enrique Tarrio, an Afro-Cuban former leader of the Proud Boys who was recently found guilty of seditious conspiracy in relation to the January 6 insurrection. Márquez and Beltrán both questioned whether those views opened pathways for men of color into more extremist ideology. What’s more, Beltrán argues that the expansion of jobs within the US security and carceral apparatus in the past few decades have both inspired movements to dismantle those systems and reinforced the perception of a nation under threat, as people from communities of color both fill those jobs and are disproportionately affected by the prison system . She added that those communities have certain views on how to resolve problems and are skewed to conservatism. “In Texas, you have a lot of migrants who are being brutalized by our really terrible immigration and border policy. But you also have over half of the border patrol being Latino,” Beltrán says. “They’re employed and being socialized into a brutal regime that is very dehumanizing to migrants.” Within the histories of their countries of origin are moments of anti-Blackness and anti-Indigenous sentiment, as well as reactionary politics that led to the violent suppression of progressive views by dictators. Beltrán says that within Texas, where the shooting took place, Latinos, particularly people of Mexican descent, have a complicated history as both having a proximity to whiteness and being subjected to lynching and brutalization by the Texas rangers. “Latinos have always existed as a population that’s both been under assault, and also been brought into practices of racial domination,” Beltrán says. In Garcia, Márquez saw a difficult tension: Garcia’s hate-filled views rest on the extreme end of a spectrum of conservatism that separates one’s connection to their racial and ethnic identity and one’s political views. She added that his hateful views, shared by an increasingly visible minority of people, were not representative but also should not be discounted. Experts have pointed to Latino Republicans who have touted their own identities on the campaign trails while they supported former president Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies. “Maybe not everyone has a swastika on their body. But many of us have aunts and uncles who say inappropriate things at the table, or have someone who voted for Trump or doesn’t want to live in communities with other people,” Márquez says. “Seeing [Garcia] as part of this spectrum is important. Yes, he is aberrant in so many ways – in so many ways. But to look away from him and eschew him from our community gets us off the hook because there is a lot of racism within the community and anti-Blackness and anti-Indigenous sentiment that we have to reckon with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/22/jude-law-wore-blood-poo-and-sweat-perfume-to-play-henry-viii-firebrand","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:55:35Z","webTitle":"Blood, sweat and poo: Jude Law wore bespoke perfume to play Henry VIII","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/jude-law-wore-blood-poo-and-sweat-perfume-to-play-henry-viii-firebrand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/22/jude-law-wore-blood-poo-and-sweat-perfume-to-play-henry-viii-firebrand","fields":{"headline":"Blood, sweat and poo: Jude Law wore bespoke perfume to play Henry VIII","bodyText":"Jude Law doused himself in a specially-brewed scent blended from “blood, fecal matter and sweat,” to play Henry VIII in Firebrand, an acclaimed new period drama which has premiered at the Cannes film festival. “I read several interesting accounts that you could smell Henry three rooms away,” said Law at a press conference in Cannes on Monday. “His leg was rotting so badly. He hid it with rose oil. I thought it would have a great impact if I smelt awful.” A specialist perfumier was enlisted to make a custom brew, continued Law. “She makes wonderful scents, and she also makes awful scents. She somehow came up with this extraordinary variety of blood, fecal matter and sweat. “Initially, I used it very subtly. But then it became a spray fest.” The film’s director, Karim Aïnouz, testified to the success of Law’s immersive approach. “When he walked in on set,” he said, “it was just horrible.” Law has won plaudits for his performance in the film, which focuses on the king’s final marriage, to Catherine Parr (played by Alicia Vikander). The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw was impressed by the viscerality of Law’s performance, writing: “The king’s bedchamber is perfumed by the pus splurging from Henry’s bloated and ulcerated legs as the doctor changes his bandages, getting thumped and screamed at by the royal patient. This Henry is peevish and cantankerous. “And we at one stage get a full-on shot of His Majesty’s pale, fleshy bum as he has conjugal relations with Catherine – like the giant, shaved arse of a sheep. Did Law use a buttock double for this stomach-turning image?” Law declared himself uninterested in the present-day monarchy, aside from its theatrical aspects. “I don’t really follow it,” he said. “I’m not one for gossip. I don’t really enjoy it. I find no interest in it, and I don’t really enjoy following tittle tattle stories.” Looking at photos of the coronation of Charles and Camilla earlier this month, “of this medieval ceremony and how it applied to today made me feel very modern,” said Law. Law has fronted perfume ads for Dior Homme and Dior Homme Sport and is known to be a client of Azzi Glasser, a British “fragrance stylist”, whose raison d’etre is “recreating DNA through smell”. After spending time with Law, Glasser made him a bespoke scent which is said to mix elements of key characters the actor has played, including Bosie in Wilde and Dr Watson opposite Robert Downey Jr’s Sherlock. Law praised it as “me, I just never had it in a bottle before!” It is described by Glasser as “decadent, with a clean and classy accord of sexy vetivert and rich mosses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2023/may/22/people-in-the-uk-aged-64-and-over-share-why-you-have-started-working-again","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:48:44Z","webTitle":"People in the UK aged 64 and over: share why you have started working again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/22/people-in-the-uk-aged-64-and-over-share-why-you-have-started-working-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/may/22/people-in-the-uk-aged-64-and-over-share-why-you-have-started-working-again","fields":{"headline":"People in the UK aged 64 and over: share why you have started working again","bodyText":"We’re interested to hear from people in the UK aged 64 and over who have come out of retirement recently.

The Blues have confirmed the influential defender will be leaving the club this summer, alongside Pernille Harder, after winning 11 trophies since signing six years ago. The victory against the Gunners has kept Eriksson’s 12th trophy across all competitions and fifth WSL title charge with Chelsea on course as they head into the final round two points clear of Manchester United. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said of her departing captain: “Magda has been so pivotal to our success. For her to get that moment in her final home game, in front of the fans she loves, nothing will mean more to her. Everybody wanted that fairytale for her. She has been our captain and leader. I know the work that has gone on behind the scenes to get the team to where it is.” SR Parris gives Wiegman plenty to ponder Sarina Wiegman has a few issues heading into the World Cup with a number of important and experienced players missing or doubts because of injury. One player who is in form and can be called upon is Nikita Parris, who has fallen out of favour with the national team coach in recent months. With Wiegman in the stands at Leigh on Sunday, she could not help but be impressed by Parris’s performance against Manchester City. She was a constant threat in the final third with her pace and movement, two things that played a part in Ellie Roebuck’s sending off. Considering Wiegman’s absentees, it could be wise to bring an elite player like Parris back into the fold. She has 72 caps to her name and a plethora of tournament experience that could prove invaluable in Australia and New Zealand. WU Snoeijs scores yet again for Everton Katja Snoeijs may not have scored the winner against Brighton in Everton’s 2-1 win but she was once again on the scoresheet for the Toffees. She has now netted in four of Everton’s last five league games, totting up five goals in total across the fixtures with two goals in the reverse fixture against Brighton in April. In Sunday’s match the Netherlands international became the first Everton player to score in consecutive home matches since in the 2019-20 season and the first player for the club to score against two opponents home and away since 2014. Snoeijs’s impact on Everton is clear as she is their top WSL scorer this season and the 12th-highest scorer in the top flight. “I was happy to get another goal in,” Snoeijs said. “The support this season has been amazing.” SR Inspired England justifies price tag at Spurs Tottenham’s Beth England advanced her World Cup claims by showcasing her goalscoring prowess in the first Women’s Super League-Premier League double header. England’s two goals ensured Spurs will remain in the WSL after they eased to a 4-1 victory over Reading. Her prolific scoring form has justified her British record transfer to Spurs from Chelsea in January and strengthened her cause for an England recall in time for the World Cup. Spurs’ interim head coach, Vicky Jepson, certainly thinks the 28-year-old merits a place in the squad. She said: “I do think she should be going to the World Cup but obviously I’m not going to tell Sarina [Wiegman] how to do her job.” With five goals in her last four matches, England is in peak form and pressing her case for a return to the international fold. She has not played for the national team since scoring twice as a substitute in the rout of Luxembourg last September. SM Thriller highlights Ward and Beard progress Carla Ward has made no secret of her desire for Aston Villa to secure a fifth-placed finish this campaign. Her team delivered, showing all of their trademark resilience in an entertaining encounter at Villa Park. A six-goal thriller in front of over 7,500 spectators meant the spoils were shared with Liverpool with both having only league position to contest. A point was enough for the hosts to gain their highest-ever WSL finish. In a topsy-turvy game that saw Villa come from behind twice despite battling squad injury, it was another sign of the eye-catching progress they’ve made over the last 18 months or so. On Liverpool’s part, their success this season has been no less noteworthy. Having returned to the top division last summer, they are now in a strong position to seal seventh which would mark an impressive achievement for Matt Beard’s side. SD Leicester send relegation battle to wire It was in their hands! All Leicester had to do was beat a struggling West Ham team at home and their WSL status would have been secure. Football, however, rarely follows a script. Leicester succumbed to a 2-1 defeat with a lacklustre performance to take the relegation battle down to the final day. It marked the visitors’ first league win of the calendar year. The loss will have been compounded by the knowledge that their opponents did not actually play well. The Foxes dominated the stats both in terms of possession and chance creation. But on one of the most important days of their season, their clinical edge deserted them. The fact that the two they conceded were an own goal and a penalty sums up an afternoon in which they also lost Ruby Mace to two yellow cards. The integral 19-year-old will be a big miss for the trip down to Brighton. The situation is still in Leicester’s hands but they can ill afford a similar showing next weekend.

Its products carry “serious network security risks” that pose hazards to China’s information infrastructure and affect national security, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement on its website. The move is the latest example of tensions between the US and China over technology, after a US ban on using the social video app TikTok on government phones and restrictions imposed by Washington on the export of some sophisticated computer chips to China. “Operators of critical information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing products from Micron,” the Chinese agency said on Sunday. A US Department of Commerce spokesperson said the move had “no basis in fact”. The China and Hong Kong market accounts for about 15% of revenues at Micron, and the company’s shares dropped 3.7% in early trading in New York. The Micron announcement came as Joe Biden told the final day of the G7 summit in Japan that he expected relations with China to improve “very shortly”. The US president said on Sunday that a spat over a “silly balloon” had destabilised the relationship, referring to the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon off the US east coast in February. China had announced an official review of Micron under its information security laws on 4 April, hours after Japan joined Washington in imposing restrictions on Chinese access to technology to make processor chips on security grounds. In Sunday’s statement the Chinese cyberspace agency said: “China firmly promotes high-level opening up to the outside world and, as long as it complies with Chinese laws and regulations, welcomes enterprises and various platform products and services from various countries to enter the Chinese market.” The decision could affect Micron products in sectors ranging from telecoms to transport and finance, according to China’s broad definition of critical information infrastructure. A Micron executive said the financial cost would run into a single-digit percentage of the company’s revenues. Mark Murphy, the Micron chief financial officer, said: “We are currently estimating a range of impact in the low single-digit percentage of our company total revenue at the low end, and high single-digit percentage of total company revenue at the high end.” The chipmaker, which is headquartered in Boise, Idaho, makes products including DRAM chips, flash memory and solid-state hard drives through its Crucial, Ballistix Gaming and SpecTek brands. It generated $5.2bn (£4.2bn) of revenue from China, including $1.7bn from Hong Kong last year, about 16% of its total revenue, according to Jefferies. Beijing is pouring billions of dollars into trying to accelerate chip development and reduce the need for foreign technology. Chinese semiconductor manufacturers can supply the low-end chips used in autos and home appliances but not the ones that support smartphones, artificial intelligence and other advanced applications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2023/may/22/crossword-book-club-michael-gilberts-close-quarters","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:36:38Z","webTitle":"Crossword book club: Michael Gilbert’s Close Quarters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2023/may/22/crossword-book-club-michael-gilberts-close-quarters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2023/may/22/crossword-book-club-michael-gilberts-close-quarters","fields":{"headline":"Crossword book club: Michael Gilbert’s Close Quarters","bodyText":"Close Quarters was published in 1947. But it ends like this: He felt an overwhelming desire for a steak – done red – and a pint of milk stout. Since it was the summer of 1937 he got both without difficulty. At this point the rations-limited reader of the time could, I hope, taste an earlier era, unimaginably different. The difference between life before and after the second world war comes up earlier too. A crossword hidden by one of the characters unlocks the identity of the murderer responsible for a strikingly ruthless body count, including a chorister. Like the maps of a cathedral close that we are given near the beginning, the puzzle takes up most of various pages while a canon and a reverend execute an admirably protracted solve. Once they become stuck, we get an exchange that takes in vain the name of the Observer’s pioneering setter … ‘It’s not playing the game,’ said Canon Trumpington. ‘Torquemada may indulge in such tricks but the Times has always been a gentleman’s crossword.’ ‘Oh, well,’ – such distinctions were above Prynne – ‘I dare say we shall work it out in the end.’ … because the fictional puzzle really is a wild, anarchic set of clues. The author, Michael Gilbert, knows what he is talking about. The eve of the second world war was a pivotal moment for the crossword and for the whodunnit. At the Observer, Ximenes took over from Torquemada and applied discipline (“playing the game”) to assist the solver. The same year, 1939, is pretty much officially the end of the Golden Age of mystery stories, and the year of publication of The Big Sleep, anyone’s go-to rowdier novel. Michael Gilbert himself, and Close Quarters in particular, belong to neither the “cosy crime” nor the “hard-boiled” camp. The ecclesiastical setting might make today’s reader expect tweeness – but Gilbert, in his first novel, promptly shares a wryness and droll cynicism. During a car chase, we find a driver has “swung his machine across the bows of a blaspheming Rolls-Royce”; in a misguided attempt at deduction our hero, Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, wonders whether the entire surviving cathedral staff … … collaborated in murdering the poor old man, having first taken care to provide themselves with carefully interlocking alibis – like a silly novel I once read. Gilbert’s idiosyncratic style is no surprise, since he was not a full-time writer. A solicitor, he worked at Lincoln’s Inn and enjoyed writing amid the “hustle and bustle” of his commute.

Otherwise known as “butterfly skin”, the rare and extremely painful genetic condition causes the skin to become fragile and tear or blister. Souness gave his backing to the charity after meeting Isla Grist, a 14-year-old living with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. “From the time I have spent with Isla and her family, I have seen first-hand the extreme pain this devastating condition causes and the daily challenges it creates,” he said. He is now set to undertake the 21-mile swim between Dover and Calais – which can take up to 16 hours – as part of a six-person team including Isla’s father, Andy. “This will certainly be the most difficult challenge I’ve ever taken on,” Souness added. “I am determined to complete the swim, though. Alongside Isla’s dad, Andy, and the rest of the team, we will complete the challenge and in doing so raise awareness and support to find the treatments that are so desperately needed.” Souness, who stepped down from his role as a Sky Sports pundit last month, is aiming to raise £1.1m for Debra’s “A Life Free From Pain” appeal, which hopes to develop treatments to improve the quality of life for people living with the condition. Discussing the swim in an emotional interview with BBC Breakfast, Souness called Grist “an inspiration” and praised her courage. “It properly punched me on the nose when I first witnessed the suffering,” he said. “This disease is the cruellest, nastiest disease that I know of. For someone so young to be so brave … she’s just an absolute hero.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/ireland-to-introduce-world-first-alcohol-health-labelling-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:35:03Z","webTitle":"Ireland to introduce world-first alcohol health labelling policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/ireland-to-introduce-world-first-alcohol-health-labelling-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/ireland-to-introduce-world-first-alcohol-health-labelling-policy","fields":{"headline":"Ireland to introduce world-first alcohol health labelling policy","bodyText":"Ireland is to become the first country in the world to mandate health labelling on alcoholic drinks to alert people to calorie content, grams of alcohol, risks of cancer and liver disease and dangers of drinking while pregnant. The health minister, Stephen Donnelly, signed the legislation on Monday and said he looked forward to other countries following the example – a prospect that has worried Italy’s winemakers and people in several other EU member states. The law would take effect from 22 May 2026 to give businesses time to adapt to a policy that mimics existing rules for other food and drink products, said Donnelly. “With that information, we can make an informed decision about our own alcohol consumption. Packaging of other food and drink products already contains health information and, where appropriate, health warnings. This law is bringing alcohol products into line with that.” Hildegarde Naughton, the minister for public health, wellbeing and the national drugs strategy, said medical evidence showed even low levels of alcohol consumption incurred a cancer risk. Alcoholic drink providers will be compelled to display the information and warnings on product packaging and also to direct consumers to the website of Ireland’s Health Service Executive for further information on alcohol consumption. Similar information will also be made available in pubs and other licensed premises. Alcohol consumption in Ireland peaked in 2001 when the average person drank 14.3 litres of pure alcohol a year. That has fallen to 10.2 litres, according to the Health Research Board. The European Commission did not object to Ireland’s plan, which the government flagged last year, despite protests from Italy, Spain and six other EU member states. Coldiretti, Italy’s biggest farmers’ association, described the “terrifying” warnings as a “direct attack”. “The green light from the European Union for alarmist wine labels in Ireland represents a dangerous precedent as it risks opening the door to other legislation capable of negatively influencing consumer choices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/junior-doctors-in-scotland-offered-cumulative-145-pay-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:34:35Z","webTitle":"Junior doctors in Scotland offered cumulative 14.5% pay rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/junior-doctors-in-scotland-offered-cumulative-145-pay-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/junior-doctors-in-scotland-offered-cumulative-145-pay-rise","fields":{"headline":"Junior doctors in Scotland offered cumulative 14.5% pay rise","bodyText":"Hospital doctors in Scotland have been offered a cumulative 14.5% pay rise in a fresh attempt by Scottish ministers to avert highly disruptive strikes. Junior doctors had voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action in Scotland for the first time after rejecting the original Scottish government offer, in a dispute closely mirroring the industrial action by doctors in English hospitals. The British Medical Association has put the revised offer to Scottish junior doctors, saying this is the best deal they are likely to get. The proposal involves an extra 3% in backdated pay on top of last year’s 4.5% award and a rise of 6.5% this year, taking the cumulative increase to 14.5% over two years. So far, no deal has been put to English junior doctors, who have carried out two strikes in hospitals. Dr Chris Smith, the chair of BMA Scotland’s junior doctors committee, said that while this offer only partly dealt with the historical shortfall between their pay over the last 15 years and the effects of inflation, it would help close that gap. Michael Matheson, Scotland’s health secretary, said he was delighted to put forward “a fair and progressive rise” to junior doctors. However, his claim that the offer had been agreed to by the BMA was rejected by Smith. “To be clear, this is not a deal we have agreed, and we have not accepted any offer,” Smith said. Even so, “we feel this offer reflects the best that the Scottish government will offer after this series of negotiations. “[The] members who gave us an overwhelming mandate for strike action will now decide whether the offer is sufficient as we begin the long overdue journey towards pay restoration, which would still have some way to go if the offer is approved.” The Scottish government said the offer would cost £61.3m and was the best made by any government in the UK: doctors’ pay deals are negotiated separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, where junior doctors have demanded a 35% pay increase to make up for a long erosion in their pay, talks are under way between the BMA and the health secretary, Steve Barclay, to settle their dispute. Scottish ministers have also proposed to set up a junior doctors pay bargaining review taskforce. The BMA said that should lead to a “vastly improved mechanism” to continue restoring pay levels in future to close the gap between pay and the cost of living."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/22/french-open-organisers-to-offer-players-ai-protection-against-online-abuse-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:30:40Z","webTitle":"French Open organisers to offer players AI protection against online abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/french-open-organisers-to-offer-players-ai-protection-against-online-abuse-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/22/french-open-organisers-to-offer-players-ai-protection-against-online-abuse-tennis","fields":{"headline":"French Open organisers to offer players AI protection against online abuse","bodyText":"French Open organisers are to offer players at the tournament artificial intelligence-protection from social media abuse.

Bodyguard can moderate comments in real time – with responses analysed in less than 200 milliseconds – and care will be taken about what is censored. Tennis players have frequently highlighted the horrific messages they receive after losses, often from gamblers who have lost money betting on them. “As part of its strategy to take care of the players’ mental health, the FFT decided to collaborate with Bodyguard to fight against cyberbullying,” the FFT said in a statement. “A team of linguists creates word patterns that enable the system to be updated in real time according to what is posted on social media, in order to generate a more contextual analysis.” The technology will be used to protect all official FFT and Roland Garros social media accounts, as well as those of players who opt for it for the duration of the grand slam and at least a week after the tournament has ended. “The mental health of the players is a priority for the Roland Garros tournament. We will not accept any form of violence at our tournament,” said Caroline Flaissier, director of the FFT. “We are very proud to be the first grand slam tournament to offer players a solution that efficiently protects them against cyberbullying. “We want to protect the players from this damaging behaviour, to enable them to be in peak mental condition when they compete in the tournament.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2023/may/22/allen-overy-shearman-sterling-merge-law-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:09:16Z","webTitle":"Law firms Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling plan to merge in $3.4bn deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/22/allen-overy-shearman-sterling-merge-law-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/22/allen-overy-shearman-sterling-merge-law-firm","fields":{"headline":"Law firms Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling plan to merge in $3.4bn deal","bodyText":"UK “magic circle” law firm Allen &amp; Overy is planning a $3.4bn (£2.7bn) merger with New York’s Shearman &amp; Sterling, in one of the biggest transatlantic legal deals in history. The merger, which is subject to a vote of partners at both firms, will create one of the world’s largest legal practices with combined revenues of $3.4bn and about 3,900 lawyers across 49 offices. The tie-up, which comes months after the 150-year-old Shearman abandoned merger talks with rival Hogan Lovells, marks the first combination between an elite London law firm and a US rival since Clifford Chance merged with Rogers &amp; Wells in 2000. The merger is a big move for Allen &amp; Overy’s long-held ambition to become a player in the US market, after a deal with the California law firm O’Melveny &amp; Myers fell through four years ago when the two sides failed to agree a valuation. “[The deal] supercharges our ability to serve clients in the US market, which has long been a strategic priority,” said Wim Dejonghe, the senior partner at A&amp;O. “Both firms have a history of excellence, and together we think A&amp;O Shearman will be a firm unlike any other in the world.” Allen &amp; Overy is the significantly larger partner, reporting revenues of £1.9bn and employing a total of 5,800 staff globally, while Shearman &amp; Sterling has 1,350 staff and made revenues of $907m last year. In February, S&amp;S announced it was laying off staff in the US, and it also saw the departure of a number of partners after the aborted talks with Hogan Lovells earlier this year. “Merging with Allen &amp; Overy will dramatically accelerate our ability to meet [clients’] needs in an increasingly complex environment,” said Adam Hakki, senior partner at S&amp;S. The proposed merger would create the third-largest integrated law firm in the world by gross revenues, with a $1bn practice in the US, the two companies said. “What excites me about this merger is the complementary cultures of our two firms,” Dejonghe said. “We have striking similarities across the board, and I believe we are going to be wonderful partners to one another on this journey.” Equity partners at Shearman took home $2.48m in average profits last year, compared with slightly less than $2m for partners at Allen &amp; Overy. The deal is expected to be put to a vote of partners in both firms this summer with completion within a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/weather-tracker-guam-philippines-brace-typhoon-mawar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:05:48Z","webTitle":"Weather tracker: Guam and Philippines brace for Typhoon Mawar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/weather-tracker-guam-philippines-brace-typhoon-mawar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/weather-tracker-guam-philippines-brace-typhoon-mawar","fields":{"headline":"Weather tracker: Guam and Philippines brace for Typhoon Mawar","bodyText":"Over the weekend, a rapidly intensifying region of thunderstorms in the western Pacific culminated in the formation of Typhoon Mawar. The movement of this storm is projected to affect the Mariana Islands, including the US territory of Guam, as early as Tuesday. There is a risk of wind speeds above 75mph, with torrential rain. Beyond this, there is forecast model divergence but with sufficient risk that Mawar will continue to strengthen as it enters the Philippine Sea over this weekend and early next week. The potential for disruptive wind and rain will therefore exist for parts of the Philippines and perhaps towards Taiwan. In large tracts of central and northern Europe, May has been a fairly cool month with temperatures running below the seasonal norm. Over the past few days, warmth has started to build, particularly across parts of Germany and into the Alps. Later this week and through the weekend, it looks likely that more significant heat will build through Spain and Portugal, eventually extending northwards through France. While there are still some uncertainties, it may well be that temperatures reach the high 20s or low 30s celsius, with parts of the UK potentially receiving some of this warmth next week. Meanwhile, in Australia forecasters are predicting some extremely windy and cold weather for south-eastern areas through the coming week, culminating in some significant snowfalls later in the week. Damaging winds gusting above 70mph affected Tasmania on Sunday, leading to widespread power disruption, with the strong winds spreading to eastern Victoria and southern parts of New South Wales. However, as a new area of low pressure pushes northwards to the east of Tasmania on Thursday and Friday, cold air digging in from the south is likely to produce a drop in temperature and the prospect of disruptive snowfall, particularly to the high ground of Victoria and New South Wales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/trump-warning-classified-documents-mar-a-lago","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:00:32Z","webTitle":"Trump was warned about retaining classified documents, notes reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/trump-warning-classified-documents-mar-a-lago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/trump-warning-classified-documents-mar-a-lago","fields":{"headline":"Trump was warned about retaining classified documents, notes reveal","bodyText":"Federal prosecutors have evidence Donald Trump was put on notice that he could not retain any classified documents after he was subpoenaed for their return last year, as they examine whether the subsequent failure to fully comply with the subpoena was a deliberate act of obstruction by the former president. The previously unreported warning conveyed to Trump by his lawyer Evan Corcoran could be significant in the criminal investigation surrounding Trump’s handling of classified materials given it shows he knew about his subpoena obligations. Last June, Corcoran found roughly 40 classified documents in the storage room at Mar-a-Lago and told the justice department that no further materials remained at the property. That was later shown to be untrue, after the FBI later returned with a warrant and seized 101 additional classified documents. The federal investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith has recently focused on why the subpoena was not compiled with, notably whether Trump arranged for boxes of classified documents to be moved out of the storage room so he could illegally retain them. In particular, prosecutors have fixated on Trump’s valet Walt Nauta, after he told the justice department that Trump told him to move boxes out of the storage room before and after the subpoena. The activity was captured on subpoenaed surveillance footage, though there were gaps in the tapes. The warning was one of several key moments that Corcoran preserved in roughly 50 pages of dictated notes described to the Guardian over several weeks by three people with knowledge of their contents, which prosecutors have viewed in recent months as central to the criminal investigation. The notes revealed how Trump and Nauta had unusually detailed knowledge of the botched subpoena response, including where Corcoran intended to search and not search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, as well as when Corcoran was actually doing his search. Although ordinarily off limits to prosecutors, the notes ended up before the grand jury in Washington hearing evidence in the case after a US appeals court allowed attorney-client privilege to be pierced because judges believed Trump might have used Corcoran’s legal advice in furtherance of a crime. The notes described how Corcoran told Nauta about the subpoena before he started looking for classified documents because Corcoran needed him to unlock the storage room – which prosecutors have taken as a sign that Nauta was closely involved at essentially every step of the search. Corcoran then described how Nauta had offered to help him go through the boxes, which he declined and told Nauta he should stay outside. But going through around 60 boxes in the storage room took longer than expected, and the search ended up lasting several days. The notes also suggested to prosecutors that there were times when the storage room might have been left unattended while the search for classified documents was ongoing, one of the people said, such as when Corcoran needed to take a break and walked out to the pool area nearby. In addition to his exchange with Trump, Corcoran described Trump’s facial expressions and reactions whenever they discussed the subpoena. The unusually detailed nature of his notes is said to have irritated Trump, who only learned about them after the notes themselves were subpoenaed. The notes did not address why Corcoran only looked in the storage room, though he separately testified to the grand jury that while Trump did not mislead him about where to search, he did not say where to search either. The New York Times earlier reported a summary of his testimony. Corcoran did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the special counsel’s office declined to comment. Constructing an obstruction case remains challenging, and prosecutors would need to show that Trump arranged for Nauta to remove boxes he expressly knew contained classified documents demanded by the subpoena, with the intention of concealing them from his lawyer’s search. Trump’s legal team have consistently said the subpoena response was incomplete because Corcoran was not as thorough as he should have been, in part because he left it until right before the deadline and only realized when he got there just how many boxes were in the storage room. A Trump spokesperson has previously said of the investigation: “This is nothing more than a targeted, politically motivated witch-hunt against President Trump that is concocted to meddle in an election and prevent the American people from returning him to the White House.” To resolve the issue about the gaps in the surveillance footage, the special counsel most recently subpoenaed Matthew Calamari Sr, the Trump Organization’s security chief who became its chief operating officer, and his son Matthew Calamari Jr, the director of corporate security. Both Calamaris testified to the grand jury earlier this month, the Guardian previously reported, and were questioned in part on a text message that Nauta had sent asking Calamari Sr to call him back about the justice department’s request for the tapes last year. The justice department interviewed Nauta several times last year until prosecutors grew concerned that he failed to provide them with a complete and accurate account of his role in moving boxes that contained classified documents, according to two people familiar with the situation. To force his cooperation, prosecutors threatened to charge him with lying to the FBI after he gave differing accounts over several interviews. But that incensed Nauta’s lawyer, who told the justice department his client would not talk again unless he was charged or offered an immunity deal. After losing Nauta, investigators have turned to other witnesses who could shed light on his role. In recent interviews, they have asked whether Nauta removed boxes containing classified documents when he was in the storage room at the time of the subpoena, and where he went with them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2023/may/22/olivia-travel-lesbian-cruise","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:00:32Z","webTitle":"‘I stood there with my mouth open.

It was a utopia’: 50 years of Olivia, the lesbian cruise company","bodyText":"Jai Henrietta still remembers the first time she went on an Olivia Travel vacation: “I just stood there with my mouth open. Seeing 2,000 women in one space, all cuddling, holding hands, and kissing – it was a utopia for me.” Henrietta has now traveled six times with Olivia, the world’s first travel company for lesbians. Her partner, Lyla Row, has been on 13 Olivia trips. For Row, the company takes away that “extra precaution” the couple otherwise has to take on holiday as a same-sex couple. “It’s relaxing, and that’s what a holiday should be – you shouldn’t be worrying about anything else,” she says. The Olivia brand, which was launched in 1973 as a radical women’s record label, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Since the company started offering cruises, in 1990, it has hosted more than 350,000 LGBTQ+ women on cruises and resort holidays from Europe to Africa and has earned a revered status among lesbians: in 2004, the premiere of the groundbreaking lesbian TV series The L Word was held on an Olivia cruise. (An entire episode – Land Ahoy – was also set on one of its ships.) The Grammy winners kd lang, Melissa Etheridge and Mary Chapin Carpenter have performed at Olivia’s events. The tennis legend Billie Jean King has been a guest speaker seven times. Months before her death, Maya Angelou gave one of her last public speeches at an Olivia summit. Along the way Olivia Travel has birthed long friendships and, naturally, plenty of romance. In 2015, Donna Shands was working for Olivia when she saw a guest, Cassandra Butler, walking alongside the pool. “It was almost like a cartoon character where your eyes go ‘boing!’” says Shands, who also set up Olivia’s dedicated programs for women of colour. “She had on a cute little bathing suit.” The two talked for an hour in the pool, with Butler saying: “It was a real connection.” They are now married and live in Maryland. (Shands has also officiated a wedding for a couple who met on an Olivia cruise.) Performing with Olivia helped the comedian Gina Yashere to publicly come out. “It definitely helped to make me more open about who I am because I wasn’t that open before,” says Yashere. “I was like: ‘Well, I’m doing these Olivia trips, I might as well just be who I am.’” She recalls that raucous-sounding, first trip to an all-inclusive resort in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010. “It was like spring break for women … I was so drunk. I ended up falling in my own suitcase!” Since that first cruise in 1990, a four-night stay in the Bahamas, Olivia has established itself as one of the leaders in the LGBTQ+ travel industry. The company offers a range of all-inclusive vacations, from cruises carrying as many as 1,400 guests to small riverboats, alongside resorts and safaris. The entire ship or resort is hired out for each trip, a strategy intended to ensure guests feel free to be themselves. “The most important thing Olivia does is create an environment where women come and feel stronger when they leave,” says Judy Dlugacz, president of Olivia Travel, who’s been there since the beginning. Last year, Olivia Travel ran more than 30 trips, including to a resort on Providenciales, in the Turks and Caicos archipelago, and from Berlin to Budapest on a riverboat cruise. Such joyful moments very nearly didn’t happen. In the late 80s, Dlugacz was on the cusp of shutting down Olivia Records, the California-based independent label she’d co-founded with a collective of nine other radical lesbians, which boldly celebrated lesbian relationships at a time when mothers risked losing custody of their children by coming out. As Cris Williamson, a founding member who still performs with Olivia, remembers, at the time “lesbians were losing their jobs, their children, their incomes”. She looks back on those days with pride, remembering fearless moves such as the release of a 1977 “Lesbian Concentrate” compilation, in response to an anti-gay campaign by the singer Anita Bryant. (Bryant was also an ambassador for an orange juice company.) “We were just so bold about it,” she says. Though Olivia Records sold over a million records, by the mid-80s the collective had disbanded, leaving Dlugacz as the only remaining founder. Money was always an issue; “Olivia had survived out of pure love and gumption,” says Dlugacz. And so, after a series of 15th anniversary concerts, including a sold-out show at Carnegie Hall in New York, she planned to announce the end of Olivia Records. Only, of course, that’s not what happened. Instead, at the first of those 15th anniversary concerts, in Seattle, Dlugacz marveled at the energy of the 2,000-strong crowd of women. “I’m going: ‘How can I stop doing this?’” she recalls. After the show, a woman came up to her and suggested doing a concert on the bay. It was this conversation that sparked Dlugacz’s idea to transform the Olivia brand into a travel company. Dlugacz wrote to the Olivia Records mailing list. She advertised a four-night cruise to the Bahamas and needed six hundred women to do it. It sold out. When she offered a second cruise, the same thing happened. “There was so much discrimination against women, and lesbians in particular, that we wanted women to feel free to come out and be themselves,” says Dlugacz. Finding a liner to host hundreds of lesbians was another challenge. “No one wanted to charter a ship to us,” she says. One agreed, only to pull out. In the end, Dlugacz found a Greek family cruise line. She recalls a heartwarming exchange with the captain when he – to reassure her – asked her where Sappho was from, the ancient poet having written of her love for women. “I hesitated,” says Dlugacz, “and he said, ‘The isle of Lesbos [from where the word “lesbian” is derived], and that is where I am from. So there will be no problems on this ship!’” In February 1990, the first Olivia cruise set sail. The reception to a lesbian cruise company in the 1990s was mixed, to say the least. Initially, the word “lesbian” wasn’t even used in Olivia’s branding. “We had an understanding of how careful we needed to be to protect the women that were part of us,” says Dlugacz. For years, correspondence was delivered in plain brown wrappers. Many women traveling on Olivia’s cruises weren’t out at home. Dlugacz remembers being on the talk show Geraldo in the early 90s, after which Olivia’s phone lines were ringing off the hook. “Half of them are calling to say: ‘I’ve never heard of this. I want to know more about Olivia! How can I go on these trips?’” she says. “Then the other half are going: ‘Suck my dick.’” In 1998, an Olivia cruise ship was met by more than 100 anti-gay protesters at a port in the Bahamas. When Dlugacz demanded an apology, the director general of the Bahamas tourism ministry came on board to say sorry to the passengers. In the decades since, Olivia Travel has built up a loyal customer base, particularly among professional women in their 30s and older. (Prices per person range from $999 for a seven-night stay on a larger cruise to as high as $12,399 for a week-long luxury cruise on a small ship in Tahiti.) In catering to LGBTQ+ women more broadly, its guests have included transgender women, non-binary people and even heterosexual women. “Olivia, as a brand, as a company, is so strongly about the female experience,” says Dlugacz. “So, however you feel you fit into that, you belong.” The company’s trips have included countries where LGBTQ+ people are criminalized or face legal barriers – including Russia, Tanzania, and Kenya – allowing guests to go to places where they might not have gone alone. Olivia has steered through its fair share of choppy waters. In 2009, the company settled a lawsuit out of court, filed against it by a former CEO, Amy Errett, who disputed her ownership interest. Court documents showed Errett was keen to push Dlugacz out of her role. (“We were almost gone,” Dulgacz says of that time.) The Covid-19 pandemic halted cruises for two years, though events were moved online. It has also shifted societal attitudes. “We make an impact just by being good citizens out there,” says Dlugacz. An Olivia cruise in 1999 to Turkey saw its guests spending good money in the rug and jewelry stores of Kuşadası, winning over the local press. When the ship reached Istanbul, Dlugacz says, “the gangway opened and the paparazzi of Istanbul were there: TV cameras and the reporters, every morning newspaper. We go to the Grand Bazaar – 400 lesbians. I’m going: ‘Oh no, what is this going to be like?’ We go inside, and I’m a little worried. Everyone had read their morning newspapers and they all started going: ‘Lovely lesbian ladies, come to my shop!’” After half a century, the Olivia brand sails on: forthcoming trips include France, the Galápagos Islands, and New Zealand. When Dlugacz co-founded Olivia, she was 20. Now she’s 71. How does she feel? “It has been my life’s work,” she says. “And I have never been bored by it.” Dlugacz says that at its heart, Olivia Travel empowers LGBTQ+ women, for many of whom there is little visibility back home. “The women who go back out to their own communities, a lot of them live in the south or live in suburban environments that are not cities,” says Dlugacz. “There is a lot of isolation still for lesbians everywhere.” Butler, who, at the time of her first Olivia cruise, was living in a town in Florida with little in the way of an LGBTQ+ community, says things changed after her first trip. “I accepted myself before,” she says. “But [I] always hid a little bit of it back because I was always kind of blending into a straight world. For me, honestly, it has allowed me to feel more confident in life in general.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/the-pet-ill-never-forget-i-spent-2000-on-ruby-the-guinea-pigs-hysterectomy-and-i-dont-regret-a-penny","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:00:31Z","webTitle":"The pet I’ll never forget: I spent £2,000 on Ruby the guinea pig’s hysterectomy – and I don’t regret a penny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/the-pet-ill-never-forget-i-spent-2000-on-ruby-the-guinea-pigs-hysterectomy-and-i-dont-regret-a-penny","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/the-pet-ill-never-forget-i-spent-2000-on-ruby-the-guinea-pigs-hysterectomy-and-i-dont-regret-a-penny","fields":{"headline":"The pet I’ll never forget: I spent £2,000 on Ruby the guinea pig’s hysterectomy – and I don’t regret a penny","bodyText":"The people who are most horrified that I spent about £2,000 on a hysterectomy for my guinea pig Ruby are usually dog owners who would spend 10 times that, if they could, on their dog. “Why didn’t you just get another one?” said a terrier owner I mentioned it to recently. “Would you just get another dog?” I asked. Most people are speciesist – it’s why we eat some animals but not others, and why many believe, in the pet hierarchy, the small ones are disposable. Anyway, Ruby was like a little dog. Even though it was 20 years ago, I can picture buying her (from an open-farm attraction with – my dream! – a guinea pig village) more clearly than the births of my children. She was scampering around, a flash of smooth, shiny brown fur, and looked so much less inscrutable than the other guinea pigs for sale; I’ve had several in my life, and she was by far the most intelligent and engaging. Ruby lived indoors, and I often let her run free throughout my flat in London. She came when called, and she could jump from the floor to the sofa, where she’d sit on me for ages and snooze. When I chatted to her, she would squeak back. I learned to open the fridge with silent stealth; otherwise she would shriek excitedly at the prospect of carrots or greens and stand up on her hind legs to be fed. She was family – when I went away, she and my other guinea pig, Puzzle (less tameable), would go to stay with my mum, who called them her grandpigs. When Ruby became withdrawn and no longer squeaked when the fridge door opened, the vet diagnosed ovarian cysts – not uncommon in female guinea pigs – but hers were big and she needed more investigations with a specialist, then an operation and months of follow-up treatment. The whole thing was sickeningly expensive, and I had to borrow the money, but I never once considered forgoing it, even though there were risks. I think, I hope, it was the right decision – she ended up living for another couple of years, until the age of eight, gradually less able to jump up on to the sofa but just as affectionate as ever. When I realised Ruby was probably dying, I stayed up with her all night. In the morning, I set her down for a few minutes to have a quick shower. I’m convinced she waited to say goodbye, because when I picked her up again she nestled into my neck for the last time and died, and my tears rolled down her glossy back. Those of us who knew her still talk about her now. So no, she wasn’t replaceable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/dealing-with-kidnappers-is-easy-a-hostage-negotiator-reveals-the-secrets-that-can-transform-your-life","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T10:00:31Z","webTitle":"‘Dealing with kidnappers is easy!’ A hostage negotiator reveals the secrets that can transform your life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/dealing-with-kidnappers-is-easy-a-hostage-negotiator-reveals-the-secrets-that-can-transform-your-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/dealing-with-kidnappers-is-easy-a-hostage-negotiator-reveals-the-secrets-that-can-transform-your-life","fields":{"headline":"‘Dealing with kidnappers is easy!’ A hostage negotiator reveals the secrets that can transform your life","bodyText":"Somewhere in Europe, a man is taken at gunpoint from his BMW. He is a successful businessman, worth an estimated €200m; from the burnt-out wreckage of his car, it’s clear this is a professional operation. In London, 48 hours later, Scott Walker is part of the team brought in to secure the man’s release. A hostage negotiator with more than a decade’s experience, Walker prepares himself for a long haul: it could be weeks before the kidnappers make contact with their demands. But the immediate negotiation is not with them – it’s with the hostage’s younger brother. After the man was taken hostage, his brother assumed the roles of a family representative, decision maker and chief negotiator with the kidnappers: a load usually shared by three people. “He saw this as his moment to shine; his opportunity to prove himself, to himself – and he really struggled,” says Walker. Attempting to shoulder the responsibility alone, the brother unravelled into a “physical and emotional wreck”. Yet the man remained resistant to the experts around him. “We call it the ‘crisis within a crisis’,” says Walker – and it can loom large, even against a backdrop of life or death. All of us have experience of letting our emotions or ego get the better of us; Walker has learned how to master his, in even the most volatile circumstances. But these lessons can be equally useful, he says, in day-to-day life. In his first book, Order Out of Chaos, Walker shares his hard-won insights on “how to become a world-class communicator” and achieve your desired outcome in every negotiation – whether it’s a pay rise from your boss, or a better rate from your bank. The book had to be reviewed closely by lawyers and peers to ensure it did not reveal trade secrets, and all case studies (including those referenced here) are composites. For Walker, writing it has meant stepping into the spotlight after a career spent strategically behind the scenes. “I thought long and hard about it, having spent most of my working life in the shadows, not wanting to bring attention to myself,” he says, when we talk one morning over Zoom. “I just saw so many crossovers with the real world.” Besides, he adds, after years of never venturing too far from a major airport, in case he got the call, he was ready for a slower pace. “I’d got to that stage where I didn’t fancy jumping on a plane every few weeks.” Walker has always been interested in psychology, the art of persuasion and “what makes people tick”. For 16 years he worked as a police detective, investigating the full spectrum of wrongdoing, from petty theft to terrorism. “I loved being a cop,” he says. “I enjoyed every single day.” Then a chance encounter in the canteen of Greenwich police station, with a colleague who had just successfully resolved a kidnapping, inspired Walker to apply to join the hostage crisis and negotiation unit at Scotland Yard. On being selected, Walker was told that there are more people who have been to the International Space Station than there are working full-time as “response consultants”. He learned the ropes by travelling the world alongside more experienced negotiators. Then in 2015, not long after his 40th birthday, Walker returned home from another successful negotiation and learned that his mother had killed herself. The loss triggered a period of soul-searching. “Some would argue that it was a midlife crisis … I was going all over the world, saving other people’s lives – and I couldn’t save the one life that really mattered,” he says. “I wasn’t going to allow myself to fall into a spiral of despair … I had to find my own path. I’m going to make the most of my life, by never wasting a moment and serving others.” Within a few months of burying his mum, Walker had divorced his wife, quit the police force and joined a private consultancy , specialising in crisis response for large insurance companies. In the police, he’d had a large team around him, but in the private sector, he says, “you were ‘it’, essentially. Sometimes, we worked alongside the police, in other cases we didn’t and they weren’t notified or if they were, they might just let us get on with it. Sometimes, the police were complicit in the kidnapping.” Walker has since helped to resolve hundreds of corporate cases, often kidnappings for ransom but also piracy, extortion and cyber-attacks, and through all of his work he has gained a “unique understanding of what makes people think, feel and act the way they do”. “Negotiation isn’t some arcane, esoteric art,” he says. “It’s everyday communication: how we communicate with ourselves, first of all – but also with our friends, our family, our colleagues and our community.” In fact, he estimates that, in any given crisis, as much as 80% of his time and energy is spent negotiating with the client (often the hostage’s family or employer). “Dealing with the kidnappers is easy,” he says; I laugh, despite myself. “It is!” Walker insists. “It becomes a transaction: they have something we want, and we have something they want – it’s just getting to the point where we can safely exchange that.” Contrast that with shadowy, unspoken family dynamics or the clashing egos and hidden agendas on an executive leadership team, and the “so-called ‘bad guys’” start to seem relatively straightforward to wrangle. “All of the emotions, the issues and human foibles are magnified in this extremely high-pressure scenario,” says Walker. In the case of the businessman taken for ransom, his brother was so determined to retain control that he refused to use a burner phone for communicating with the kidnappers – meaning that every innocent call or notification he got on his own phone sent his cortisol skyrocketing. Walker tried to reason with him, emphasising the importance of managing stress and uncertainty, of erecting boundaries around the negotiation, but the brother refused to listen. When – after sleepless weeks – the kidnappers finally made contact, with a ransom demand of some €20m, the brother lost his cool and threatened them with revenge. The kidnappers’ response was calm and immediate: they would kill their hostage. Then they hung up. Walker does not blame the brother for frustrating the delicate operation: in the heat of the moment, his response was only natural. But the example demonstrates Walker’s No 1 rule, ahead of any negotiation: gain control of your own internal state. Kneejerk reactions, leading with anger or fear, and negative self-talk often lead to undesirable outcomes. “It starts with yourself, your mind and your emotions – then you work outwards,” he says. “It’s an inside-out game.” He recalls another kidnapping case, early in his career, in which the family’s point-person was refusing to move to a safe house for the negotiation. “I was getting really frustrated with him, to the point of shouting: ‘What do you not get about this?’ And that’s when my more experienced colleague subtly put his hand on my shoulder and gave it a squeeze.” Calmly and confidently, Walker’s colleague reduced the tension by reminding the hostage’s family that their No 1 priority was simply to breathe. After that, he slowly took them through the objectives for the next call with the kidnappers – starting by reassuring them that they were all motivated to resolve the situation. “It was then that I realised that how to get people onside is a learnable skill,” says Walker. It comes down to “emotional self-regulation”: learning to manage one’s ego and emotional responses so as to counter the deleterious effects of stress, communicate more effectively – and secure a better outcome. For this reason, even through a live crisis like a hostage situation, Walker would encourage clients and colleagues alike to prioritise their wellbeing with rest, nutrition and movement. He would even remind the kidnappers to sleep and drink water if they seem to be struggling to function. Walker calls this entering your “battle rhythm”, whereby you prepare your mind and body for a tense, lengthy negotiation. “It’s taking control of what you can, and not worrying about the rest,” he says. Mindfulness exercises such as box-breathing and visualising a successful outcome can also help boost resilience in the face of conflict. The chemical, bodily reaction to an emotion such as fear or anger can pass in fewer than 90 seconds, Walker says – if you choose not to feed it. “It is that ability to know, ‘I’m being hit by a tsunami of emotion here’ – and to feel it,” he says. “Don’t shy away from it, or pretend it doesn’t exist.” Much of Walker’s advice wouldn’t feel out of place on Headspace, the beloved mindfulness app. But that’s just proof of the universality of mindset training, he says. “I’m not pretending that I’ve created some brand-new way of doing things … it’s been with us thousands of years.” Everyone from Tibetan monks to ultra-marathon runners have benefited from techniques to control the ego and quieten the mind. If it seems like a particular challenge today, Walker suggests, it may be because the times are just so noisy and reactive. He points to the polarity on social media. “Heaven knows the world needs better conversations right now … Everybody’s shouting, no one’s listening.” With practice, he suggests, it’s possible to create a calm, balanced and objective state of mind that you can readily assume whenever you find yourself under pressure. He likens it to creating your own internal “red centre”, or crisis comms HQ, to which you can mentally retreat when faced with an unpleasant or unexpected situation, and have faith in your decision-making. Often, Walker says, the feelings provoked in us by other people are telling us something about ourselves. “Everybody wants to blame the other person for quote-unquote ‘triggering’ them – but actually it’s a mirror.” Knowing this can be a useful tool for developing greater self-awareness, he adds: “Why’s this showing up for me? Why am I so incensed?” But, just as vital as keeping your own emotions in check is cultivating empathy for the other side, he adds. His second rule for negotiation success is: “It’s not about you.” To get someone to see your point of view, first you must seek, in earnest, to understand theirs. This sets up a relationship that makes it possible to meet halfway. If you are angling for a pay rise from your boss, Walker suggests asking yourself: how can you demonstrate your value to the company, or contribute more? If your landlord wants to increase the rent, Walker says to start by researching whether or not it’s a reasonable request. If not, “then it’s about articulating: ‘I pay my rent on time every month, I really like living here, I’m happy to sign up for another 12 months or two years’, etc – rather than going, ‘No, I’m not going to pay that,’” he says. Putting yourself explicitly in your landlord’s position – by demonstrating awareness of the market from their perspective, the costs and risks – can be helpful in building rapport. “What you want to do is get to that point where they go, ‘The tenant gets me’ rather than, ‘They’re just trying to pull a fast one,’” says Walker. “I’d rather take £50 a month less from someone I really trusted and got on with.” Good relationships can be fostered through active listening, and asking better questions, says Walker. Often we can be too quick to share our own experience or push for resolution, leading the other side to feel manipulated or dismissed. “A negotiator knows that the person is not going to open up until they feel seen, heard and understood.” But sometimes, he adds, “walking away from a negotiation is the right thing to do”. Other times, the real reward may register at first as a loss. “You might have made the uncomfortable decision to move out, or find a new job – but actually it could end up being the best thing that ever happened. It is about that willingness to withstand uncertainty.” In the case of the businessman, after that explosive call with his brother, the kidnappers went silent for days, then weeks. Eventually, after three months, the brother was persuaded by the rest of the family to step back. Walker and his team were able to reconnect with the kidnappers, with a more level-headed relative in the role of intermediary, and negotiate the hostage’s safe release. “Thankfully,” says Walker, “I’ve never lost a hostage from a negotiation.” I wonder: does anybody ever say no to him? He laughs. “I’ve got a pretty good success rate.” But, he says – having shown his children how to manage their emotions when they were young – now that they’re teenagers, “they’re kind of wise to it. Sometimes they’ll know what buttons to press with me.” Order Out of Chaos: How to become a World-Class Communicator and Win Every Negotiation by Scott Walker is published by Piatkus TPB (£14.99) on 25 May.

Along with the boardroom drinks cabinet and stationery cupboard, Veronica was the best thing about Dad’s work. Despite manoeuvring a not-small trolley covered with warm cups and pots of boiling water, she seemed to move with more ease than anyone else in the building. Welcome everywhere, she knew everyone and what they needed, be that strong tea with milk and one sugar, or black with two pills of sweetener and a chocolate digestive. While it was communal, the small kitchen was Veronica’s, and immaculate. She took the tea towels home, and made sure the biscuit tins were always full. When we visited as kids, those tins were hugely important. Like my grandma’s tin, they were filled with different combinations of the good ones: chocolate digestives, plain digestives, custard creams, bourbons, ginger nuts (Dad’s favourite, and not only because he, too, was ginger). I want to remember Hobnobs, too, which launched in 1985, the same year as EastEnders and the Anglo-Irish agreement. And then there was the delicious story about someone in accounts who, working late, would eat the contents of an entire tin. Our own biscuit tin fell off the top of the fridge a few weeks ago, but the dent means it now closes better. Decades later, and 2,000 miles from Hemel Hempstead, I keep it filled with a good selection of Italian and English biscuits. They are usually bought, but occasionally homemade, in which case there is a good chance they will be from Biscotti: Recipes from the Kitchen of the American Academy in Rome, written by the head chef at the time, Mona Talbott, and the Sicilian pastry chef Mirella Misenti. Each of the 62 recipes begins with a short introduction, often mentioning where the biscuit fits into academy life: suitable for breakfast; a pleasing bite with coffee; as part of afternoon tea (the afternoon biscuit plate is a serious business); for scooping up pudding. Then there are several biscuits with specific roles: the iced ginger biscuits served after the Christmas play; the chocolate meringues that get whipped up for someone’s birthday; Friday night chocolate cookies; and these oat-and-raisin biscuits “often packed in picnics for a fellow to take to their studio when working intently on a project, or visits to archaeological sites”. Quite the recipe note, or maybe I am too easily influenced, but I fully believe that oat-and-raisin biscuits will help me work more intently, or sustain me when I do eventually visit an archaeological site. Until then, they sustain me through the morning; a cross between a flapjack, Hobnob and Mulino Bianco multi-cereal, and dead easy to make. Now, I’ll be Veronica and put the kettle on. “Would you like a biscuit?” Oat-and-raisin biscuits Makes 20-24 100g raisins, soaked in 100ml warm tea (any will do – I use Yorkshire) for 15 minutes 100g butter, at room temperature 100g caster sugar 1 egg 1 tbsp golden syrup 1 tbsp treacle 120g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 100g rolled oats Salt 1 tsp cinnamon While the raisins are soaking, cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl, then beat in the egg, syrup and treacle. Drain and squeeze the raisins, then add them to the bowl with the flour, oats, a pinch of salt and the cinnamon and work the mixture until it comes together into a sticky ball. With floury hands, break the dough mixture in two and roll each half into a log about 10cm long and the radius of a small biscuit. Wrap and chill for at least two hours (and up to a month). Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line a baking tray. Using a sharp knife, cut the logs into 5mm-thick rounds and arrange these on the tray, spacing them well apart.

With its two main characters Bramble and Briar, adorable bears who were abandoned by their mother in a forest fire, this environmentally conscious adventure is an entertaining, if rather formulaic, ride. For lovers of cute animals, the CGI designs of the brothers are quite lovely and detailed, though not exactly distinctive. Goofy and optimistic Bramble believes that their mother is out there searching for them, but Briar holds no such hope. However, a chance encounter with Charlotte, an aspiring scientist, promises a new clue that would lead the pair to their long-lost mummy. What follows is an extravaganza of good versus evil, bears versus bots. There’s a curious paradox here: while Boonie Bears: Guardian Code’s plot points are absolutely generic, their execution remains rather well done. Fashioned with metallic tentacles for arms, the menacing and gigantic robot used by the villain looks suspiciously similar to the killing droid that terrorises Pixar’s The Incredibles, while a number of twists seem borrowed from older classics. Still, the animation is lively enough that these face-off sequences can still deliver a dose of thrills. In the English-language dub, some of the voice talents are occasionally wooden, but the film compensates for this lack with a nice central song. Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is not going to blow the minds of the adults – or the more discerning little ones – but this can make for a fun, though possibly not very memorable, cinema outing. • Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is released on 26 May in UK and Irish cinemas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/digital-nhs-technology-health-service-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T09:45:31Z","webTitle":"No more missing records or letters lost in the post – I will bring in a totally digital NHS | Keir Starmer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/digital-nhs-technology-health-service-keir-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/digital-nhs-technology-health-service-keir-starmer","fields":{"headline":"No more missing records or letters lost in the post – I will bring in a totally digital NHS","bodyText":"The NHS faces an existential crisis. A crisis that is both immediate and long term. Yes, it’s about how the Tories have run the NHS into the ground over the past 13 years, with ambulances not arriving until too late, swift GP appointments a thing of the past and more than 7 million people waiting for treatment. But it’s about a lot more than that. Today, with an ageing population, more long-term chronic illnesses and far more knowledge about how to prevent ill health, the NHS needs to adapt. That is why today we are announcing details of our health mission with the clear aim of making the NHS fit for the future – a prevention-first model and a shift from hospitals to the community so that illness is caught early and at home, not late and in hospital. But there is another change that could totally reframe the NHS and how it operates, and save money: moving from an analogue system to a fully digital NHS. The NHS is in pole position to take advantage of advances in science and technology, if only ministers realised it. We have a thriving life sciences sector, a universal health service with an entire population’s data and the ability to move at pace, as was shown with the vaccine rollout. So what could a tech revolution in the NHS look like? More than 30 million people signed up to the NHS app during the pandemic. That is a big number and represents the majority of adults in this country. Covid made it necessary. Yet, post-Covid, this resource – a resource that could be harnessed for the good of the public – has been left dormant. It’s another tale of our time – another opportunity missed, indicating the absence of strong leadership. A Labour government would get hold of that NHS app and use it to drive forward a more patient-focused, responsive service. Get this right and it means moving to “a single front door to all NHS services” – fully digital patient records. In one place a patient will be able to book appointments, use appropriate self-referral routes, get reminders for checkups and screenings, receive the latest guidance on treatment and have the ability to take part in clinical trials, something particularly important if you are one of the more than 3 million people in the UK who will be affected by a rare disease in their lifetime. Patients will be in control of their own data, choosing how it’s used and how it’s shared. This could mean a genuine democratising of healthcare, helping to get rid of the divide between those who are confident to speak up for themselves and those who can’t. And, of course, it will need careful management to ensure those who are less comfortable using technology are supported throughout and given alternative routes where needed. This could add up to faster care, more choices for patients and the ability for us to better manage our own health. In short, a new relationship between citizen and the NHS – the rebuilding of trust in a service so badly bruised by the past few years. A fully digital NHS will mean primary care, hospital care and social care are joined up properly for the first time, speaking to each other in ways that can speed up and streamline care for patients. And it doesn’t stop there. Technology provides more choice and power for patients, but it also saves lives. Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform patient outcomes, improve productivity and save money in the NHS. Here’s an example. Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths in the UK. There are an estimated 274,000 patients in the UK waiting 11 days or more following a scan to find out whether or not they have the disease. AI interpretation of chest X-rays can save 15% in radiologists’ workload, reduce costs and, when combined with interpretation by a consultant radiologist, can reduce missed lung cancer cases by 60%. Rolling this type of tech out nationally could speed up lung cancer diagnosis, saving thousands of lives. Another example, genomic medicine, can be similarly life-changing. Today, genomic screening can spot predisposition to big killers such as cancer or heart disease in babies, diagnose rare diseases and help personalise treatments. With the power of genomics, we could help every one of us live a healthier life, prevent more illness and take more care of our lifestyle choices. Harnessing the revolution in science and technology will require huge drive, strategic leadership and breaking down the barriers that are holding it back. It means new incentives to innovate throughout the NHS, with fewer barriers to adopting scientific breakthroughs, fewer unnecessary hurdles to clear to get new treatments adopted, less bureaucracy, more clinical trials and a government properly backing our life sciences industries. The NHS needs to change. Our plan deals first with the immediate crisis. But to make the NHS fit for the future will require an unflinching commitment to harnessing the possibilities of science and technology. If we do so, I am optimistic the NHS will not only survive but thrive for the decades to come.

Gudanji/Wakaja writer Debra Dank’s book We Come with This Place won the prize for major book of the year at the NSW state library on Monday night, and was also named winner of the Indigenous writers’ prize, the prize for non-fiction and the award for new writing. Dank’s book, which was also shortlisted for this year’s Stella prize, is partly a story of her family, telling of her late father Lurick, or “Soda”, who was falsely accused of stealing livestock and then chased from his country in the Northern Territory across the Queensland border by white pastoralists “armed and threatening death”. In a memoir that spans many different timelines, Dank also writes of the shocking sexual abuse inflicted by white men on her paternal grandmother, and delves into the Dreaming stories of her people, and the intergenerational trauma suffered after massacres in Australia’s frontier wars. The judges praised Dank’s book as “culturally rigorous and deeply thoughtful” with “emotional depth”, communicating how country provides “physical, spiritual and psychological nourishment”. The author demonstrated a “powerful path forward from colonial trauma towards a space of mutual respect and self-determining futures”, they said. Dank, who lectures in Indigenous studies at the University of the Sunshine Coast, never envisioned publishing a book. She had written down her family’s “ongoing stories” as part of her PhD in narrative theory and semiotics. She handed them for proofreading to a friend and former colleague, Karen Williams, the former executive director of the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, where Dank had worked. “I just wanted it to be readable,” Dank told Guardian Australia. “Karen said, ‘Oh, this is great, we have to talk to publishers.’ I thought, ‘Yeah, sure, we’ll do that, and they’ll say that’s lovely, thank you, goodbye.’ “I’m still in the space of, ‘Is it really a book?’ because books have always been critically important to me,” she said. “There’s always been this other place of existence for people who produce books; they’re almost next to godliness for me.” In a review for the Guardian, Miles Franklin-winning author Tara June Winch described We Come with This Place as “a jewel of a book” to rival Australia’s great desert memoirs. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Dank’s publisher, Juliet Rogers - the managing director of Sydney-based Echo Publishing and a former chair of the Indigenous Literacy Foundation – said Dank “manages to say so much … [but] she doesn’t ever have to belabour a point. It’s done with such nuance, and when she speaks she’s utterly spellbinding”. Small publishers are having a moment of outsized acclaim in Australia: more than half of last week’s Miles Franklin longlist were published by independents, and the entire Stella prize shortlist was devoid of major publishers. While Echo’s parent company is Bonnier Books in the UK, the small publishing house has full editorial control over its “intrinsically Australian” author list. “Smaller presses, we do a lot more searching out,” Rogers said. She reads every manuscript herself. “[We’re looking for] new voices talking on something unexpected … Sometimes what happens at the big publishing houses is the [manuscripts] just don’t get through.” The book’s structure – moving back and forth between past, present and future – was inspired by polyphony, or the fact many Indigenous voices contribute to the narrative of communities. “The non-linear time reflects the normalcy of all Aboriginal storying across our continent,” Dank said. As a child, Dank grew up with a “taste for learning”, which she credits to her late mother Maxine, a “teacher with a deep curiosity about everything”. Lurick, her late father, was born on the banks of a birthing creek on Wakaja country, and “didn’t read words on paper. He heard them in the voices in the wind, whispering through the grasses”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup When Dank was a teenager, her father told her “vaguely and in bits and pieces” about his flight pursued by white pastoralists. “[But] it continued to impact him absolutely until he passed away. He developed dementia, and those memories manifested themselves in horrific ways. “It frustrates me, the lack of ability of us as a nation to own and to articulate and talk about this history,” she said. “The non-Aboriginal community really struggles to accept these horrors and traumas are our shared past.” Dank agrees “absolutely and utterly” on the principle of the Indigenous voice to parliament, which is likely to be subject to a referendum before the end of the year. “But having been in education as long as I have – and seeing the commitment to ignoring the first populations of this country – we need to understand it’s not policies that will help; it is actually people understanding that it requires them to make personal change.” She’s not filled with hope: “We have been sidelined, ignored, purposefully forgotten about,” she said. “As a nation I don’t know that we have an ability to imagine even committing to actions, which are the only thing that will make the voice a reality if the referendum gets up ... “Whether we [Indigenous people] are represented in the constitution or not, I don’t think is the big question in all of this. Me going out and experiencing racism at my local shopping centre is not a result of policy, it’s not a result of anything other than a committed ignorance to being aware of the diversity of this country.” Winners of the NSW premier’s literary awards also included Katerina Gibson, who won the fiction prize for Women I Know; Kim Cheng Boey, who won the poetry prize for The Singer and Other Poems; Dylan Van Den Berg, who won the playwriting prize for Whitefella Yella Tree; Corey Tutt and Blak Douglas, who won the children’s literature prize for The First Scientists; and Lystra Rose, who won the prize for young people’s literature for The Upwelling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/22/the-comedy-of-errors-review-full-of-wit-and-pizazz-shakespeares-globe-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T09:32:08Z","webTitle":"The Comedy of Errors review – full of wit and pizazz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/22/the-comedy-of-errors-review-full-of-wit-and-pizazz-shakespeares-globe-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/22/the-comedy-of-errors-review-full-of-wit-and-pizazz-shakespeares-globe-london","fields":{"headline":"The Comedy of Errors review – full of wit and pizazz","bodyText":"Sean Holmes is associate artistic director at the Globe and there’s a lightness and ease about his Shakespeare productions that’s not to be scoffed at. The props and costumes here, wittily designed by Paul Wills, have just the right amount of pizazz to raise a chuckle (who knew a gold chain could be genuinely funny?). The audience interaction reels us in without overdoing it and the actors seem comfortable with the text, happy to embellish the Bard’s dialogue with their own distinctive comic gifts. The context remains relatively untouched yet the show feels contemporary – largely down to a sort of droll knowingness that runs through the ensemble, with lines like, “Well, this is strange!”, cutting through the complex plot with amusingly glib efficiency. We’re still in the rather strange city of Ephesus, where Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant Dromio have come to seek out their long-lost twin brothers. Antipholus’s estranged parents also happen to be in town and – you guessed it – endless incidents of mistaken identity ensue. This is one of Shakespeare’s shorter comedies and Holmes has chosen to gallop through with no interval. With this in mind, he keeps the pace motoring and the visual gags amped up high. The approach only starts to flag in the final third when all that comic seasoning starts to feel just a little overdone (Chuck in a lusty doctor! How about a wacky sister! Comic beards! Comedy boats!). Michael Elcock, as the increasingly dazed and confused Antipholus of Syracuse, has a great line in comic yelps and gobsmacked expressions. Jordan Metcalfe, as Dromio of Syracuse, scampers about the stage with excellent comic timing and George Fouracres (a comic as well as actor) attacks Dromio of Ephesus’s confounded speeches with virtuosic speed and precision. The only thing missing is just a little stillness. Some time to sit with Shakespeare’s language. These snatched moments lie almost solely with Paul Rider’s Egeon. As he tremulously describes the shipwreck that “unjustly divorced” his family, the bustle dies down and he brings us all along with him on his torrid and windswept journey.

The NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission’s (LECC’s) five-yearly report into “critical incidents” included seven recommendations including an urgent call for better mental health training for officers. A critical incident is a police operation that results in a death or serious injury. The report was released on Monday evening amid fierce community and political conversation about the use of force by police after a 95-year-old woman with dementia was tasered by officers in a Cooma nursing home last week. The commission looked at incidents from mid-2017 to mid-2022, of which 12% involved First Nations people. Thirteen Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people died, while six were seriously injured. Between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022, six Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people died, while two were seriously injured. That represented at least double the numbers for each of the four years prior. The report also warns of significant delays to internal investigations of critical incidents. The delays are caused by police practice to wait for the conclusion of criminal or coronial court proceedings before commencing critical incident investigations. “This process can take years,” the report said. “The chance to swiftly improve policies and practices is being missed.” On average, the internal investigations examined by the LECC took 20 months to be finalised. Only 52 of the 157 investigations examined in the report have been finalised, despite some stretching back to 2017. The report recommends setting up a system of interim reporting on critical incidents, so that changes are identified and implemented in “a timely manner”. It also made note of the substantial proportion of people who die or are seriously injured in critical incidents who are experiencing a mental health episode. The commission found almost half of the 157 critical incident declarations made over the past five years related to people in crisis, and noted that while more should be done to train officers in mental health responses, it was not a new issue. “The adequacy of the training provided to police officers, to respond to incidents involving a person experiencing a mental health crisis (‘mental health training’), has been an issue for the NSWPF, long before the commission commenced monitoring critical incident investigations.” the report said. “Important coronial recommendations have been made in this regard.” The LECC also found that police were not dealing with police misconduct until after criminal or coronial proceedings were finished. “This leads to a risk that misconduct may continue or reoccur,” the report found. The LECC’s chief commissioner, Peter Johnson, called for police not to delay implementing changes to policies shown to be problematic until the end of legal processes. “Changes to such practices should not be put on hold until the end of coronial or criminal proceedings,” he said. The report also raised concerns about the way NSW police was handling alleged misconduct by officers in connection with critical incidents. It found that since mid-2017, about 16% of the 157 critical incidents were associated with one or more allegations of misconduct. About 16 misconduct allegations have so far resulted in sustained findings being made against police officers. But the commission warned that misconduct investigations were being dealt with separately to investigations into critical incidents, meaning delays, unnecessary duplication, and findings that “are not always congruent with findings that may have been warranted on the basis of all available evidence”. It warned the delays in investigating misconduct meant “any management action may be significantly delayed and will not mitigate risks of similar misconduct occurring in the interim”. “The delay may also affect the fairness of taking management action and therefore the type of management action that is taken,” the report said. “Indeed, given the passage of time, it may be too late to take management action.” The commission will monitor the implementation of its recommendations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/may/22/australia-politics-live-anthony-albanese-png-pat-conroy-narendra-modi-g7-quad-senate-estimates-bnpl-voice-referendum","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T09:09:18Z","webTitle":"MP speaks out against voice claims – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/22/australia-politics-live-anthony-albanese-png-pat-conroy-narendra-modi-g7-quad-senate-estimates-bnpl-voice-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/22/australia-politics-live-anthony-albanese-png-pat-conroy-narendra-modi-g7-quad-senate-estimates-bnpl-voice-referendum","fields":{"headline":"MP speaks out against voice claims – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today – thanks so much for joining us. Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: ABC journalists across the country have stood in solidarity with Stan Grant after he announced he would be standing down from Q+A due to receiving racist abuse. Stella Assange told the National Press Club the life of her husband, Julian Assange, is “in the hands of the Australian government”. When asked about the matter, Anthony Albanese said, “this issue does need to be resolved and I will continue to advocate as I continue to advocate for Australians around the world”. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, has blasted opposition leader Peter Dutton for spreading “misinformation and scare campaigns” about the Indigenous voice during debate in parliament today. Meanwhile, Cricket Australia has become the latest national sports body to endorse the voice. Australian man Jason Bernard Kennison, who climbed Mount Everest after learning to walk again, has died on his return from the summit. Clare Nowland, the aged care resident who was Tasered by a police officer in Cooma last week, remains in a “heavy sleep” and is comfortable, continuing to receive end-of-life care. Communications minister Michelle Rowland has warned the “status quo isn’t good enough” on gambling advertising as the independent MP Zoe Daniel and some Labor MPs push for a ban on the ads. The Albanese government announced it will regulate buy now, pay later schemes as credit products as cash-strapped consumers fall into debt. In Senate Estimates, the Greens’ Barbara Pocock has been asking Labor’s Penny Wong about the government’s decision to appoint former chief of the foreign affairs department Kathryn Campbell to a special role overseeing Aukus, despite her previous role in the robodebt program. Pocock noted that when Campbell was shuffled into her new role in June 2022 the government already had findings of the federal court that the program was unlawful. Wong replied: You’re saying ... there was a federal court decision that it was unlawful ... I don’t think it would be fair to say there had been an interrogation of how that illegality came about. The royal commission was intended to elicit that information. Some of the evidence has been beyond what we might have envisaged. It’s been quite substantial. I don’t want to, obviously, speculate on potential findings of the commission. Pocock then pressed, by asking why didn’t the Albanese government simply end her employment. Wong said the question which “used the phrase captain of the ship ...assumes the knowledge of what has subsequently been discovered in the commission”. She added that the evidence “has been – certainly beyond what I would’ve anticipated”. As the former head of the Department of Social Services and, before that, the Department of Human Services, told the commission she accepted the scheme had been a “significant” failure of public administration. She said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions and conceded external legal advice should have been sought: “In hindsight it was a big assumption to make.” Campbell told the royal commission on 7 December: “I wish I had [checked the legality of the scheme] but at that stage [in 2015 when it was developed] I relied on DSS.” She said this had been “unwise”. From my colleagues Amanda Meade and Natasha May: ABC news chief Justin Stevens says he regrets not defending Stan Grant earlier as the Q+A host faced racist attacks on social media fuelled by what he described as a “relentless campaign” against the ABC’s coronation broadcast from News Corp. Read more: Call to recognise Indigenous skills of early educators Better recognition of a person’s Aboriginal culture is important to encouraging and developing greater Indigenous representation in the early childhood workforce, a royal commission has been told. South Australia’s Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People April Lawrie said it was one thing for people to gain the necessary qualifications to work effectively in the sector. But she said it was another matter to have the unique skills that come with a person’s cultural background. She told SA’s Royal Commission into Early Childhood Education and care on Monday: It’s open to anyone to get a qualification at university in early childhood education and expect that person to be equipped to work with Aboriginal children and their families. That is a lot different to an Aboriginal person who has got those qualifications in early childhood education but also has knowledge and skills about how you work with the child and with their family. [It’s] about how you build their confidence and their learning about who they are as an Aboriginal child in the 21st century with 60,000 years of culture and history behind you. - from AAP More than 800 Australian secrecy laws have a ‘chilling effect’, campaigners argue More than 800 Australian secrecy laws have “no place in a healthy democracy” and are undermining the important work of whistleblowers, journalists and human rights groups, a review has been warned. The Attorney General’s Department is reviewing the vast number of secrecy laws restricting the disclosure of government information. A discussion paper informing the review identified 849 secrecy provisions in existence across Australian federal law, and found that about 15% of them were designed to protect law enforcement information. About 10% protected national security matters and 40% governed the disclosure of personal details held by the government. In a joint call for reform, the Human Rights Law Centre, Transparency International and Griffith University’s centre for governance and public policy said the “breadth and depth of these provisions create a significant chilling effect”: Presently, in Australia, the balance between secrecy and transparency is unjustifiably and undemocratically tilted in favour of secrecy. The degradation of the freedom of information regime, insufficient protections for press freedom, inadequate whistleblower protections, laws that undermine open justice and onerous secrecy provisions have, individually and collectively, heightened secrecy in the Australian government and undermined transparency. The groups praised Mark Dreyfus, the attorney general, for initiating reform and recommended, among other things, that penalties for breaching secrecy provisions be reduced to ensure they were proportionate. The groups also recommended a “robust exemption for whistleblowers, human rights defenders and journalists communicating information in the public interest”: Adoption of these recommendations would be a significant step forward for democratic accountability, whistleblower protection and press freedom in Australia. Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at the HRLC, said the web of secrecy laws had “no place in a healthy democracy”: They pose a daily risk to whistleblowers, human rights defenders and journalists – and are having a chilling effect on accountability. There is a need for urgent reform. Prof AJ Brown of Griffith University said the review of secrecy offences should only be one part of broader reforms to improve transparency. Reforms of whistleblowing laws – already mooted by the federal government – were also critical, he said, as were improvements to the freedom of information system and robust open justice protections. Transparency International Australia’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, urged the government to embrace the opportunity to narrow secrecy laws and “ensure they only apply where there is a genuine public interest in confidentiality”: Right now, secrecy laws are allowing government wrongdoing to go hidden, while brave whistleblowers are punished for doing the right thing. 50 people serving terrorism-related sentences More than 50 people are currently serving sentences for terrorism-related charges, the Department of Home Affairs has told Senate estimates. Department secretary Mike Pezzullo said there was a “master list” of the 56 prisoners, with some coming towards the end of their terms. Once their sentence is up, they will either be subjected to a continuing detention order or the department would work with other authorities to reintegrate them once they are released. Obviously, there are a number of convictions some years ago, those terms are coming to the ... end of their term… the attorney general’s department and others are given full visibility of the likely release or parole periods. The estimates committee also heard there are about 60 Australians still in Syria – 17 family members were returned last year. About 40 of those family members are believed to be in the Roj detention camp, in brutal conditions. Department officials did not reveal where in Syria other Australians might be. Senator Lidia Thorpe speaks out in support of Stan Grant To catch up on today’s biggest headlines so far, my colleague Antoun Issa has the latest: The Bureau of Meteorology has published its weather outlook for the week ahead, with temperatures fairly seasonal across the country – within a degree or two of the average May maximum temperatures. The cold temperatures are mostly being felt through the overnight and early morning weather, however a cold weather system may be on its way on Thursday: Liberal MP Bridget Archer has delivered a barely veiled rebuke of her own party’s opposition to the Indigenous voice, directly rubbishing claims that the consultation body would divide the country by race – an argument made by her party leader, Peter Dutton, just hours before. Archer, speaking on the constitutional alteration bill, read out contributions from Indigenous members of her community in Tasmania. She told the chamber “we need the national voice to help the state transition to a treaty and truth telling process as quickly as possible”, that “the voice will be needed at a state and national level”, and that “something needs to change”. Archer said: We cannot continue to do the things we have always done. The communities want more than constitutional recognition. They call for positive solutions that will improve the lives of our people. The Liberal MP, who has said on several occasions that she has weighed up her continuing association with the conservative party, then took time to address criticisms of the voice. Archer has committed to campaigning strongly for the voice, and has so far been the most publicly vocal supporter of the change in the Liberal party. She said: No, the voice won’t have veto power or act as a third chamber ... To claim otherwise is a deliberate and harmful misrepresentation of the facts, and I’m disappointed to have seen this wilfully perpetuated by some. Nor does the argument that this referendum is dividing the country by race make sense. Hours earlier, Dutton had claimed the voice would leave the country “divided in spirit, and in law” and “permanently divide us by race”. Dutton claimed: The voice will re-racialise our nation. Archer also made a point of noting her opposition to reintroducing the cashless debit card. Dutton’s speech said “a government I lead will reinstate the cashless debit card in communities who seek to have it”. MPs asked about PwC On the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, Labor MP Kate Thwaites is asked for her thoughts on consultancy firm PwC and whether they should “have the book thrown at them”. She says: There are a number of inquiries and committee processes going through that … and it is clear that something has gone very wrong. My main take-out is we need to invest in the public service … Liberal MP Russell Broadbent also weighs in: Governments contract in good faith to organisations like PwC. They have let down [their] side completely in this case. They are doing the very best to put the best spin on what is a disgraceful exposure of what has happened here. Coleman on Stan Grant Coleman is asked about Stan Grant’s departure from Q&amp;A and whether he believes ABC management has responded appropriately: The first point is racism is abhorrent, evil and disgusting and no Australian should ever be expected to tolerate racism. In relation to the issues of Stan Grant … that’s something for the ABC management to address. … it’s something [where] they need to step up and say how they’ve treated Stan, he’s obviously not happy with the treatment … If Stan has been subject to racism – as he said he has been – that is appalling. Coleman ended his answer with: … that doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t be allowed to have frank and open debate about issues about ABC coverage, including the coverage of the coronation, where there were many people who had very strong concerns about the way that coverage was presented and that’s entirely appropriate for people to raise those concerns. That’s a very different matter though if people are being racist to Stan Grant. Coleman asked about push for age verification for adult websites As the shadow communications minister, David Coleman was also asked about the push for age verification for adult websites. He acknowledged the issue is “very complicated” when it comes to privacy and would like to see the eSafety commissioner’s report on the matter made public. He said: There’s something important the government can do here though, and that’s adopt a principle that social media companies should act in the best interests of children. We had that in legislation in late 2021 and draft changes to the online privacy act. What that would mean is, if a social media company facilitated the provision of content to a child which is not in their best interest - and some of the content is in that category - they’ve been in breach. So we would very much encourage the government to take up that legislation. My colleague Josh Taylor reported on this last week, in case you missed it: Liberal frontbencher David Coleman asked if he will campaign for no vote on voice Coleman has told the ABC his position on the voice is the same as the Coalition’s stance and that he doesn’t support the proposal put forward by the government. When asked if he will be voting for the actual bill, he said he would “leave those more detailed questions to others as we go through the process”. He was also asked if he would be actively campaigning for a no vote: I’ll be putting that position in line with the Coalition’s position, and this is an issue on which we want to have a sensible and calm and measured debate … A massive thanks to Amy for taking us through the morning! I’ll be with you for the remainder of the evening. My colleague Emily Wind is going to take you through the evening, but I will be back with Politics Live bright and early tomorrow morning for the second day of estimates hearings (the first day is always a little departmental and dry) and the ongoing debate over the referendum legislation. A very big thank you to those who joined us today and I hope to see you tomorrow. Hope you are warm and get a moment to think about nothing – until then though, take care of you. Ax Greens’ Barbara Pocock on consultants and conflict of interest Pocock wants the use of all consultants looked at, telling the ABC: If you look at the history of these consultants, they are multinational consultants, the biggest entities in the world. There is clear evidence of a similar practice in the UK in 2013, where four of the big consultants were reviewed for exactly the same kind of insider trading. It is a concern that there is a public national example that occurred a few years before exactly the same practice, in principle, here in our own country. I think we need an international review analysis of the practice, but it is not just that kind of conflict of interest that we need to be confident that we are pursuing. We have large consultants who are setting parameters for a government program while at the same time advising private clients on how to make that program work to their advantage. Perception and actual conflict of interest … is what we want to track down. Greens senator says PwC affair ‘squarely in remit’ of new national anti-corruption commission As reported earlier, the Greens senator Barbara Pocock wants the new national anti-corruption commission to look into the PwC affair. It doesn’t look like Senate estimates has changed her mind. Pocock told the ABC: I think it is a systemic problem we need to pursue and really chase down the kinds of conflicts that are very evidently acted on and it’s appropriate, squarely in the remit of the Nacc. It should be top of their work agenda. We’ve got recent, very reliable reports of $21 billion of public funds going to consultants and contractors, so we need to be confident the corruption is not endemic in this industry. We need to go hard after this particular example in PwC. Another defence project added to troubled program list The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, announced today that the “Satellite Ground Station – East and Wideband SATCOM Network Management System” had been designated as a project of concern. The statement says: While infrastructure for the project has been delivered, including three large ground antennae, it is facing ongoing schedule delays due to other technical challenges. The project is designed to transform and improve new and existing Defence wideband ground stations and deployed systems across Australia to meet the increasing need for greater satellite communications capacity. Conroy said the listing “demonstrates the Albanese government’s commitment to remediating underperforming projects, in order to deliver the capabilities urgently needed by the Australian Defence Force”. He said the government would work closely with Northrop Grumman Australia “to get this project back on track”. Court decision could pave way for compensation for NT traditional owners AAP has an update on a federal court case, the outcome of which could see traditional owners in the NT receive compensation: A decision by a full bench of the federal court has potentially paved the way for compensation for traditional owners in the Northern Territory. In 2019, the late Yunupingu, of behalf of the Gumatj clan, made an application for native title for land in the Gove Peninsula, in north-eastern Arnhem Land. At the same time he lodged a compensation application, for the alleged effects on native title of certain executive and legislative acts from 1911-1978. Yunupingu died in April and the ceremonies honouring his life are continuing this week, following a public memorial last Thursday. The commonwealth argued for a number of reasons that the compensation case was misconceived in law, but the court rejected all of those arguments, meaning the case can proceed. Meanwhile, in Labor-led South Australia ABC journalists at the Parliament House bureau are also making a stand This is happening in ABC newsrooms all over the country. There are more questions to the speaker about overdue answers to questions and Milton Dick says he will get right on that. He tables a couple of reports and then it looks like we are getting back to the referendum legislation debate. Josh Burns is up next speaking on that. And question time ends. Labor asked about migration numbers Liberal MP Michael Sukkar asks Julie Collins: New dwelling construction is at its lowest level for 10 years, builders are collapsing and housing is dropping on the government’s watch, yet the government’s own budget papers say 5 million will come to Australia over the next five years. When will the minister finally admit Labor has no plan to house its big Australia? Collins goes through how migration numbers are still lower than what the opposition had forecast when it was in government, the fact that there is an accelerated bump because of the closed borders during the pandemic, that the nation’s housing ministers have met four times since the Albanese government came to government, but hadn’t met for years under the opposition, and finishes with the housing future fund which the opposition is opposing. Cricket Australia has become the latest national sports body to endorse the Indigenous voice to parliament, following the likes of the NRL, Rugby Australia and the AFL in publicly indicating its support for the yes vote in the referendum. In a statement on Monday afternoon, Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird said the board is “proud of cricket’s powerful and unique history with First Nations people” and that it supports the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian constitution through the voice. We encourage respectful and inclusive conversations across cricket to support our staff, players, volunteers and officials’ ongoing journey of education on First Nations histories and cultures and the proposal to formalise a lasting and appropriate voice for First Nations people through the referendum,” Baird said. For its part, the Cricket Australia board supports the establishment of the voice. In doing so, we acknowledge and respect that everyone is entitled to reach their own decision come the referendum. Last week RA and the AFL joined the NRL in explicitly supporting the yes vote, while Football Australia and Tennis Australia have expressed their support for the Uluru Statement from the heart, of which the voice is the first component. The Australian Olympic Committee and Commonwealth Games Australia have also announced they would be advocating for the yes campaign, leaving just Netball Australia of the major sporting bodies yet to formalise a position. Chalmers quizzed on Queensland passenger movement charge Andrew Wilcox, the LNP MP for Dawson, who is still the second Google entry on “who is the MP for Dawson” so might need to get his media mentions up, asks Jim Chalmers: Tourism accounts for billions of dollars of economic activity across Queensland, including my electorate of Dawson. Labor are slugging Queenslanders with a new tourism tax by increasing the passage of movement charge from $60 to $70. Why do Australians always pay more when Labor breaks its promises? Chalmers: The honourable member is right to say that the passenger movement charge is going from $60 to $70, it has not been indexed since I think 2017 so I replaced the indexation of the charge. What he didn’t say in the question, what the house might be interested in, is that this payment is for people leaving Australia. I have more faith in the tourism industry of Queensland than the honourable member does if he thinks an extra $10 to leave Queensland is going to deter people from coming to Queensland in the first place. They are not sitting around in London, they are not sitting around in London or Brussels thinking ‘I really wanted hit the Sunshine Coast but that $10 on the way out is going to prevent me’. They are not sitting around the capitals of Europe or North America or throughout the region saying ‘I really want to go to Cairns and drop a few thousand dollars in one of the most beautiful places on Earth but I won’t do that because of the extra $10 that reflects the indexation from 2017’. These are the depths to which those opposite will plummet. To try and pretend that the budget that we handed down a couple of weeks ago was something other than a demonstration of the responsible economic management that has been a hallmark of our first 12 months in office – and was so conspicuously absent from the rest of the decade that those opposite – a wasted decade defined by rorts and waste and economic mismanagement and deficits as far as the eye can see and $1 trillion of debt with almost nothing to show for it. We make the right decisions for the right reasons, you saw that in the budget and I believe in the tourism industry of Queensland. I say that as a proud Queenslander and a proud Australian. People continue to come to Queensland because it is amazing. People continue to come to Australia because it is amazing and $10 to leave Australia again won’t deter them. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie asks Anthony Albanese: You would be aware that Stella Assange is in Parliament House and in fact is in the gallery right now. Why are you not meeting with Stella today? Will you meet with Stella tomorrow and why won’t you do more to see Julian Assange reunited with Stella and their young sons Gabriel and Max? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for his question. And indeed, who I meet with is determined by priorities that my office has. A priority for us is not doing something that is a demonstration, it is doing something that produces an outcome. And that is my focus, not grandstanding. If I thought that that would help, then yes they would be the case, as the member for Clark has. I have made it very clear to the US administration and also to the UK administration of the Australian government’s view and I appreciate the fact that that is now a bipartisan view, after those comments that enough is enough. When it comes to the ongoing incarceration of Julian Assange, that nothing is served with the ongoing incarceration of Julian Assange. What I have done is to act in the most effective way possible. If having a demonstration produced an outcome, then there would be an argument. But what I have done is act diplomatically in order to maximise the opportunity that is there, breaking through an issue which has gone on for far too long. I appreciate the member’s sincerity on this issue along with a range of other measures from across the parliament who have raised this issue. As an Australian prime minister, I have made representations, I will continue to do so, but this issue is not a simple one and I do not make any … my motivation here is not to make a judgment, people will have different judgments about the actions of Julian Assange and can still reach that conclusion of enough is enough. But it is certainly my view that this issue does need to be resolved and I will continue to advocate as I continue to advocate for Australians around the world, that is the role the Australian government has, that is the role we will continue to have, and I’m very pleased this is now a bipartisan issue and I acknowledge that. Tony Burke takes a dixer on the “strongest jobs growth” and talks about the increase to wages, to which Paul Karp hears LNP MP Rick Wilson yell out “real wages?” repeatedly, which is interesting given there was no real wages growth for about 10 years under the Coalition. PM says he will speak with minister and assistant treasurer about inquiry proposal Anthony Albanese gives an actual answer to the question. I thank the member for his question and I indeed have visited the electorate with him, witnessing firsthand the devastating impact of the flooding that occurred, also witnessing at the same time the extraordinary resilience of communities that he represents, in common that must be said with the member for the Riverina and the member for Page. Whenever you visit an area that has been devastated, I have been struck by a couple of things. One is the extraordinary work of the professional support, including public servants but also the volunteers through organisations like the SES and the work that they do. I know as well that the issue of insurance has been a very big one for a long period of time – getting communities back on their feet is vitally important, insurance plays a big part of that. The government is spending $25.3 million over five years to help reduce the cost of insurance in disaster prone communities. This includes the establishment of hazard insurance partnership with the insurance sector to address insurance issues driven by natural hazards. The package will identify where the most pressing insurance issues are and how to best address them and support better targeted mitigation and resilience strategies. (he goes on to talk about resilience funding and levies and then finishes with) Can I say this on behalf of the government but I think on behalf of every member here; we expect insurance companies to meet their obligations under the insurance code of practice, including the requirements to manage disputes and the payment of claims and act in an open, fair, honest and transparent way with their customers. I will speak with the relevant minister, the assistant treasurer as well about your proposal for a parliamentary inquiry. I respect the way that you have put it forward as an appropriate way of raising that issue and I say that with you, the government stands ready as with every member in this chamber to provide support for communities at the time of need. PM asked about response of insurance companies to recent natural disasters Former Nationals MP turned independent Andrew Gee asks Anthony Albanese: In the central west of New South Wales, communities like Eugowra and others were devastated by the storms and floods of last year. The stories of heartbreak and tragedy have been made worse by the shocking and coldhearted treatment of many local residents by some insurance companies. The anger in our communities is white hot and I don’t think we are alone. Will your government support a parliamentary inquiry into the response of insurance companies to recent natural disasters in Australia? Look at that – an actual question on behalf of constituents. It’s almost like you have to step outside the two-party system in order to ask questions that matter to the people who vote you into parliament to represent them. Albanese on inflation Back to Anthony Albanese’s actual answer to that question on core inflation being higher in Australia than the US, the UK and the EU: I am getting to the question. Which is that I too would be angry if I had presided over a 2.1% increase, the largest quarterly increase in the March 2020 two quarters. That was the highest, the highest inflation this century, was on their watch. In their response after they ... After that quarter, in March was to ... massively increase spending in the vain hope they would be re-elected in the May 2022 budget. That is just a fact. And it is a fact that on that budget, on that budget day they, of course, had a whole lot of spending but no savings. And it is also a fact that we produced two budgets that have produced $40 billion of savings, it is also a fact that we overwhelmingly returned the increase in revenue to the bottom line, to take pressure off inflation. That is why Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank, has said on the 2 May, “Inflation in Australia has passed its peak”. That is why all the ratings agencies have said it is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. Westpac’s Bill Evans said they do not expect them to put upward pressure on interest rates. More ABC staff stand with Stan Grant There are also ABC staff protests in Melbourne And in regional newsrooms around the country Reflections on members … Back to the very grown-up and important happenings of question time featuring very serious and important people – Anthony Albanese responds to Peter Dutton with: When he is finished, Mr Speaker. He is very angry and frustrated and I suspect he is angry because he The member knows ... LNP MP Luke Howarth, who seems to see his job as standing up and making points of order about reflections on members, does just that: It is standing order 90, we have had one minute from the prime minister and all of that time he has been reflecting on the leader of the opposition, and everyone else on this side, standing order 90. But no one knows the standing orders as well as Tony Burke who almost seems bored with having to shut down another of Howarth’s “won’t anyone think of the reflections of the members’ laments”: Practice is quite specific about the sorts of things that constitute reflections on members – pointing out the leader of the opposition is angry is not covered by that standing order. It is important to note that Anthony Albanese has not actually had a chance to answer the question yet. Breaking into question time for a moment as there is a walk out at the ABC: Journalists are gathering at the ABC studios in Sydney in solidarity with Stan Grant. Grant said on Friday he was standing down as host of Q+A after receiving “grotesque racist abuse” that escalated after he spoke on the ABC about the impact of colonialism ahead of the coronation of King Charles. Indigenous and non-Indigenous ABC journalists are holding signs in solidarity, as well as media from other outlets including NITV. Suzanne Dredge, the head of Indigenous News at the ABC, said: We want this to be a turning point for the ABC, for First Nations journalists, the media as a whole and for the Australian community. We need to call out racism and do more to address this awful blight on all of us. The impact it has on First Nations communities across the country is devastating. We know First Nations and Diverse journalists are targeted more than anyone else on social media. Dutton has a point of order: There are millions of Australians hurting at the moment because of decisions of this government. Instead of the hubris can you answer the question please, core inflation is higher than those other countries! ‘Smile a bit more’ After Anne Aly takes a dixer, we move on to the Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh who asks pretty much the same question as Tony Pasin (identical questions aren’t allowed under the standing orders): Can the prime minister confirm Australia has a core inflation rate higher than the US, UK, and the euro area? There is a to and fro about whether the question is the same, but Milton Dick is trying to say he will allow it, but first has to get through the faux-indignation of the opposition that he may not have allowed the question. Peter Dutton: This is a very tight question, it hasn’t been fully answered, the prime minister has not answered that question. And he should be, frankly, given some indication now that he needs to answer that question which he has refused to do so far. Dick is not loving today and asks the prime minister to answer the question. Albanese: He [Dutton] had the weekend off, he could have relaxed and chilled out and come here on Monday and been a little happier. Because that is what his [focus] groups are telling him, he has to be happier. Smile a bit more, remember when he ran for the leadership he was going to smile some more. That was his core promise, Mr Speaker. Have some thought for the poor old shadow treasurer. All these economic questions and he can’t get one. Economies compared The short version of Jim Chalmers’ answer to Angus Taylor is “this is a budget for middle Australians” but the answer isn’t the point – it is the question and the opportunity to stoke more division. The chamber moves on with Liberal MP Tony Pasin asking Anthony Albanese: Can the prime minister confirm Australia has a core inflation rate higher than the US, the UK, and the euro area? Albanese: I am asked about Australia’s economic performance, in comparison to other countries. Is that not the question? It is quite good because I was with Prime Minister Sunak yesterday. Of the Conservative party, he was saying to me how well Australia is going. With our better inflation figures. With our better performance when it comes to jobs growth, with our better performance when it comes to, of course, our budget surplus as well. And indeed, if you look at the G7 countries and how we are going, our GDP growth of 2.7% … Paul Fletcher rises to say that wasn’t the question, but it is all theatre at this point. On relevance … Jim Chalmers responds to Angus Taylor: Now I’ve heard everything. The party of deliberate wage stagnation and wage suppression has the nerve to come in here and talk about middle Australia after everything they did. Taylor is back on his feet with a point of order on relevance, despite not even 30 seconds going by. Relevance. The question was about the budget, middle Australia was in the talking points, not the question. Yes. Talking about talking points that you included in your question at the behest of the opposition tactics team is certain to win the hearts and minds of “middle Australia” but anyway. Taylor is told that he doesn’t get to choose which part of the question the treasurer answers, talking points or not. Chalmers: What would he know about relevance? I was asked about middle Australia and I’m talking about a budget which delivers for middle Australia. Paul Fletcher is on his feet (we may have clocked over to 3o seconds in this answer by now, but only just). Fletcher: The treasurer is a serial offender, breaching standing orders about offensive words and reflections on members. He just sneeringly said what would the shadow treasurer know about relevance. He ought to withdraw it. Tony Burke seems to be enjoying himself though: The point of order he has taken is to claim a word that they used about 27 times every Question Time is un-parliamentary. That’s what he has just said. I know that they are angry … but in terms of a point of order, if the word relevance is now going to be un-parliamentary, there’s no words left. (Happy with that, Albanese can be heard saying). Milton Dick verbally rolls his eyes and tells the treasurer to get on with it. Angus Taylor on ‘middle Australia’ Taylor has a question for Jim Chalmers (which is like Christmas for Chalmers) and he must be planning on putting the question on his social media because he is VERY serious in his delivery. Taylor: Middle Australia is hurting. The treasurer had one job in the budget, to reduce pressure on inflation not increase it. The treasurer failed. Why has the treasurer brought down a big-spending budget which makes life harder for middle Australia? (There is a big push from the Coalition to create as much division as possible – you have seen it with the voice, and now the budget with a focus on “middle Australia”, the idea being if you can create division, you can create some space to claw back some relevance. So that has been the focus of the response to the budget – compounding the Coalition’s anti-voice position, by trying to divide by class. It is an old trick, but one the Coalition hopes will gain some traction given how much people are suffering financially.) Jim Chalmers takes the next dixer which was literally a press release – that the Albanese government has seen more job growth in its first year than any other government start in recorded history. Home affairs made 4,000 requests to social media companies to pull pandemic misinformation or disinformation Dipping out of question time for a moment, the home affairs department has made more than 4,000 requests to social media companies to take down pandemic misinformation and disinformation. The department picked up those social media posts during its normal process of scanning for extreme violence and terror-related content. It used the platforms’ own criteria to pick which posts were in breach, but had still been published. Almost 10,000 referrals were made for terrorism and violent extremism. (Liberal senator Alex Antic and One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts are crying censorship because they themselves have had posts taken down.) Bob Katter is a gemini. Knew it. (I am also a gemini) “78 years young,” he says when given the call on his birthday. I am not sure what the question is about – something about the voice? Linda Burney wishes him a happy birthday before moving on to answering the question, which is a heroic effort, given that it appeared to be a series of statements, with some form of inflection at the end. Anthony Albanese responds: I thank the deputy leader for her question and the government of which she was of a part – all about introducing new taxes for new revenue measures. They introduced changes to the Hecs threshold, increased application [fees] for partner visas, increased depreciation for computers, increased charges for these applications, introduced a non-salary sacrifice, changes to managed investment trusts, changes to optional banking unit regimes, changes to fifo workers, [changes in taxes] for working holidaymakers, changes for the calculation of work-related car expenses, and foreign investment fees for real estate and farmers … they increased … passport fees, tobacco tax, they applied the GST on low-value goods. Ley is annoyed and expresses it with a point of order – Albanese is asked to get back on track with the actual question and says: You could drive a truck through that question*. This is the mob that wanted a tax on every single time you went to the doctor ... when I went through the budget, my attention was drawn towards a quite extraordinary comment by the deputy Liberal leader. And she said this about the RBA minutes, she said this – ‘it sounds to me as if they are sounding alarm bells on this Budget’. There is only one problem with that – the meeting was the week before the Budget! Before the Budget! So, the RBA Governor apparently is Nostradamus, Nostradamus! It says everything about their catastrophic nonsense, where they carry on, everything is a catastrophe, everything is a disaster, everything is going to go wrong on their watch. They have nothing constructive to add, nothing constructive to add. The only person [who] was more pleased about that comment by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the bloke sitting there [Peter Dutton]. *Paul Karp tells me that the Coalition was yelling “truckie tax” at this point, if you were worried about the standard of debate in the house during question time. Sussan Ley brings up ‘$275’ cut to electricity bill promise as ‘broken’ We are back to the normal order of things with Liberal deputy leader, Sussan Ley, taking the second opposition question. Ley asks: One year ago, the prime minister promised a $275 cut to electricity bills but power prices have increased. One year ago he promised cheaper mortgages but since then interest rates have risen 10 times. One year ago he promised no new taxes but he is already at the resources sector with a gas tax, the agricultural sector with a farm tax and Australian truckies with a truck tax. Why do Australians always pay more when Labor breaks its promises? Once again, the $275 cut was for 2025, but honestly it is just screaming into the abyss at this stage. The RBA controls interest rates. And the rest of it – sigh. Oh no – the first dixer is on the Quad and the G7 meetings. Which were also a press release. Right on time – the LNP social media accounts release this: Anyways, there is a byelection coming in July. Arthur Johnson, a veteran of World War II, is in the gallery – he turns 100 next year, and receives a special shout-out from the speaker, Milton Dick, and a round of applause from the chamber. And then … it is in to question time, where, after a condolence motion and moment to honour a veteran, the tone is immediately lowered. Peter Dutton opens with: It is only been a year under an Albanese government and middle Australia is hurting, the typical Australian family, [is] at least $25,000 worse off as the cost of living worsens. This is despite personal promises from the prime minister before the election of cheaper power, cheaper mortgages and [that] Australians would be better off. Why do Australians always pay more when Labor breaks its promises? Albanese responds with a version of a press release on the Labor government’s achievements in the first year – which he will repeat in just a moment with the first dixer. Bet. In-person voting back for Australians overseas during voice referendum, AEC says If you are living overseas and want to vote in the upcoming voice referendum, you will have as many in-person options as you did before the pandemic closed borders and polling places. The AEC has announced that “in-person voting services for Australians overseas at the time of the 2023 referendum will return to pre-pandemic levels”. From the statement, Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, said: … the return to pre-pandemic overseas voting services will be enabled again by the long-running partnerships between the AEC, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Austrade. The reduction [made] to in-person polling places during the pandemic was unavoidable for a range of operational and COVID-19-restriction-related reasons in many overseas locations. I’m pleased to say the environment as it stands will mean the number of overseas voting centres open in cities across the world for the referendum will return to pre COVID-19 levels. Labor MP Meryl Swanson is getting a national audience for her 90-second statement, with the ABC switching over to QT a little earlier than usual. Question time will be delayed for condolence motions – Tony Staley, a former Liberal minister in the Fraser government, died earlier this month. Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton will deliver speeches in his memory. The 90-second statements are underway in the house, which is effectively an airing of the grievances for the opposition. LNP MP Ted O’Brien is still trying to link an increase in power prices and groceries to the Labor government. Good times. Solicitor-general’s advice on voice is that it will ‘enhance Australia’s system of government’ In the House, Linda Burney pointed out that critics of the voice referendum were seemingly putting aside the legal advice of the solicitor-general, who backed the amendment as legally sound. The solicitor-general’s advice was that the voice “would enhance” Australia’s system of government and “rectify a distortion” in the existing system. And yet this is not enough for those hellbent on dashing the hopes of a people. Not enough for those hellbent on stoking division. Not enough for those trying to play politics on an issue that should be above partisan politics. The government believes we have the right amendment. Burney encouraged all politicians to back the referendum. Let’s get this done together. There is now less than 20 minutes until the first question time of the sitting. Prepare yourself now. Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, has blasted Peter Dutton for spreading “misinformation and scare campaigns” about the Indigenous voice. Burney spoke on the constitutional alteration right after Dutton, who made claims about the voice being a “reckless roll of the dice”, invoking George Orwell’s Animal Farm and alleging the body would divide Australia. We have just heard in one speech every bit of disinformation, misinformation and scare campaigns that exist in this debate. She said constitutional recognition was overdue for Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, noting gaps in education, life expectancy and justice outcomes. It isn’t good enough. Something has to change, for the better. She said the voice would help deliver better advice to the government for better policy and outcomes. Burney gave a special shoutout to senator Pat Dodson, the special envoy on reconciliation, who is away from parliament at the moment dealing with health issues: “we’re all thinking of you”. She also noted that the government was committed to regional and local voices, noting there would be a process to “plug” the national body into those smaller local bodies. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie is one of the MPs attending the event at the Press Club. Dutton warns ‘The voice will re-racialise the country’ Back in the house again for a moment and Peter Dutton’s speech against the voice is hitting all the major threads that the No campaign has been circulating, claiming the proposed Indigenous consultation body is “a symptom of the madness of identity politics” and alleging it would go against the spirit of the national anthem. It will have an Orwellian effect where all Australians are equal but some Australians are more equal than others. If the voice is embedded in our constitution, there will be little to rejoice for when we sing the second line of our national anthem ‘for we are one and free’. Instead of being one, we will be divided in spirit and in law. The voice will re-racialise the country. Assange’s WikiLeaks US document release was ‘right for the time’, Stella Assange says If Stella Assange could go back and time and advise Julian not to use the documents related to the US actions in the Iraq and Afghan wars, would she? Assange: I think we need to recognise that we are in a much worse situation in terms of press freedom, the public’s right to know, citizens right, than we were in 2010 when WikiLeaks published about the Iraqi and Afghan wars and the publications that Julian is now being prosecuted for. Those publications, that moment in time, represented probably press freedom at its strongest, internet freedom at its strongest. And since then we have seen a series of legislative moves across the Five Eyes and elsewhere as well to stop that kind of thing in different ways and also to limit citizens freedoms in different areas. I think the publication – it was right for the time and Julian was not prosecuted, he was not indicted until 2017. So, we’re in a much worse position now than we used to be and that is why it is so important to reverse course because it is not just Julian, the implications of this case mean that we are diverging from this protection that used to exist and unless we are just going deeper and deeper into a far removed [place] from where we used to be, from press freedom at its strongest, from our citizens freedom at their strongest and at the same time, it is not just our freedoms that are being limited – it is that the state has become enormously more powerful through surveillance tools and so on. Our rights as citizens, our rights as the public, we need to defend those because that’s all we have and then of course the ability to speak the truth, to publish the truth is central to that. PM&amp;C deputy secretary questioned over using PwC for future government consulting contracts The department of prime minister and cabinet is giving evidence at Senate estimates, revealing they project they will spend $2m on consultants this financial year, down from $2.3m last year. The Greens’ Barbara Pocock is asking about whether the department have any contracts with PwC (no) and whether it has considered banning it after the scandal of its use of confidential information to advise clients on tax avoidance. David Williamson, a deputy secretary, said: We haven’t imposed a ban on PwC. However, one of the criteria for procurement is ethical behaviour, and certainly we’d bring that to bear when considering PwC and anyone else ... We certainly take processes regarding procurement and integrity very seriously. At a whole of government level, the treasury is doing further work. They are mainly dead-batting questions - any further questions about consequences for PwC will be best addressed to treasury. Stella Assange: ‘This is the closest we have ever been to securing Julian’s release’ Stella Assange is asked about quiet diplomacy and whether that is enough and says: Australia is the United States most important ally, that is clear. Maybe this was not the case 10 years ago. It is important to recognise that Australia plays an important role and can secure Julian’s release. Julian’s life is in the hands of the Australian government. It is not my place to tell this government how to do it, but it must be done. Julian has to be released. I place hope in Anthony Albanese’s will to make it happen. I have to. This is the closest we have ever been to securing Julian’s release. I want to encourage and do everything in my power to help that happen. Is it enough that the prime minister now has a public position that “enough is enough” when it comes to Julian Assange’s case? Stella Assange: I am just Julian Assange’s wife, I cannot tell this government how to conduct its diplomacy. Obviously, is not just public statements but what is happening behind the scenes that needs to occur to secure his release. … If there is political will, a solution will be found, it is up to the principals to find that solution. Jennifer Robinson: We are pleased that the Australian government has come out with that position but we need action and what that action looks like is making sure that it is being raised with the United States government at every level and with all relevant client agencies involved in this case to make clear that this case is a problem of the Australian government [that] needs to be resolved. We continue to have our own outreach for the Department of Justice and have called for the case to be dropped, we continue to call for the case to be dropped for the reasons I’ve explained – the first amendment consequences and the fact that this violates the Biden Administration’s own policy against prosecuting members of the media and that this prosecution needs to be put on [hold] and so the Government can support us and continue to support us and we need to make sure that they continue to make a top clinical priority in the US-Australian relationship. Dutton tells House that voice referendum is regressive, not progressive – ‘a reckless roll of the dice’ Back in the house for a moment and opposition leader Peter Dutton claims the Indigenous voice would leave Australia “fundamentally altered, not for the better”, calling it a “reckless roll of the dice”. Opening the debate on the constitutional alteration bill in the House of Representatives, Dutton claimed the voice would “take our country backwards not forwards”. The voice is regressive, not progressive. It should be clear to Australians by now, the prime minister is dividing us, not uniting us. Dutton was critical that the government had not held a new constitutional convention on the voice, and resurfaced previous criticisms that the government would not put out specific details of the voice’s operations before the referendum. (The government says the referendum is about the principle of the voice existing, that people will be voting on whether the voice would be set up at all, not about the specific details of the body - which will be able to be changed by future parliaments) Instead we had a 4.5 day committee, a kangaroo court led by a government that never wanted to entertain changes to its bill. The approach is a reckless roll of the dice. Earlier before Dutton’s address, Labor MP Peta Murphy rubbished complaints that the proposal had been rushed, claiming the voice had gone through a longer consultation period than any other constitutional change, noting the concept had gone back to 2010, and been through numerous processes inside and outside parliament (including several committees, reports and inquiries). Human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson tells Press Club Assange’s case ‘cuts across political divides’ Jennifer Robinson, a human rights lawyer who is part of the legal team for Julian Assange, said the change in government in Australia has given some hope because of the public position of Anthony Albanese that “enough is enough”, but that a shift in attitude in Washington is also having an impact: The first thing to say is we’re very pleased that the Australian government, our prime minister and the ambassador have made very clear the position that enough is enough and this case has to be brought to an end and it is important we continue to keep the pressure on our governments to continue to make this case a political priority. It is getting in the way of the US-Australia relationship, which is an important one, but if we can resolve this case, that’s all the better for our relationship. The feeling is there is a significant concern on the Hill about the first amendment ramifications of this case, over and above the fact that he is an Australian citizen, so the interest in DC is quite different than it is to us here in Australia – it’s about the first amendment and what it means for the news media there, rather than being an Australian citizen. We have seen a group of Democratic members of Congress asking for the case to be dropped, which I think is a sign of the growing concern there in the United States [for] the same reasons but the political support crosses the aisle, so we have supporters from the Republican side, Democrat side – this is a case that cuts across those political divides and unifies people across the divide around what is a fundamental question about first Amendment democracy, but there is more work to be done there. [continued from previous post] Pearson, one of the architects of the voice, accused Dutton of a “Judas betrayal” after the Liberals opposed the voice. Pearson also came under fire last week after describing former human rights commissioner Mick Gooda as a “bedwetter” for proposing amendments to the bill. Wolahan went on to say that there would be people in the community who went against the campaigning calls of “their corporate employer, their professional associations, their sporting codes, or the views of their friends, family and their political party”. He said being a “contrarian” was “the true measure of character and courage”. Wolahan singled out Liberal colleagues Julian Leeser and Bridget Archer, backers of the voice, as people of character. However, he also raised concerns about legal risk in the voice amendment, hinting at the kind of issues Leeser has raised in calling for the “executive government” provision to be dropped from the proposal. As we reported last week, it is unlikely the government will be entertaining amendments to the proposal at this stage, but a renewed push to change the contentious executive government section will give some MPs extra food for thought. Liberal MP Keith Wolahan calls out alleged ‘odious slur’ on Peter Dutton during voice debate Liberal MP Keith Wolahan has accused Indigenous leader Noel Pearson of making an “odious slur” against opposition leader, Peter Dutton, during the debate around the Indigenous voice. Wolahan, making a statement on the report of the parliamentary committee that probed the voice amendment, told the House that he was concerned about some of the public commentary around the referendum. The Liberal MP, deputy chair of the committee, joined his party colleagues in writing a dissenting report to the majority finding (that the bill be passed unamended), instead calling for changes to the bill. Wolahan thanked contributors to the inquiry who had raised their concerns about the amendment. They were not afflicted by subconscious racism, or bed wetting, or the odious slur ‘Judas betrayal’. They are our fellow Australians, many of whom have worked tirelessly for years for the cause of reconciliation. We are better than this. If such attacks on motive and personality are normalised, we will be a more divided nation, no matter the result. Assange is being used ‘as a deterrent to bully journalists into submission’ Stella Assange: If sovereignty is to mean anything, if jurisdiction is a proper legal and political reality, the case of Julian, the case against Julian, cannot be understood as anything other than an absurdity. A stupefying decision of egregious overreach. The case is the worst and most enduring legacy of the Trump administration. It is not just outlandish, but extremely pernicious. Julian is being used as a deterrent to bully journalists into submission. The case against him sends the message that each of you in this room are fair game. It is a show of contempt for democratic accountability and of the rights of victims of government wrongdoing. Stella Assange said if Julian is extradited, he will never again see freedom. She speaks about how it is time for him to be allowed home to Australia: If Julian is extradited, he’ll be buried in deepest, darkest quality of the US prison system. Isolated forever. That is what is done to defendants in so-called national security cases, even before trial. [A] 175-year sentence is a living death sentence. A prospect so desperate that the English court found that it would drive him to take his own life rather than live forever in hell. We must do everything we can to ensure that Julian never, ever sets foot on US prison. Extradition in this case is a matter of life and death. Lawyer and human rights advocate Stella Assange and human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson are addressing the National Press Club today. Assange is on her first trip to Australia – she and Julian Assange married in March 2022 in the Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London and have two children. They first met in 2011 over the work of Wikileaks. Assange has been campaigning for the Australian journalist’s release and is calling on the Albanese government to act. Assange: My visit here was originally prompted by the official visit of President Biden and the Quad summit. After it was cancelled, I decide to come anyway. I did not want to lose the opportunity to speak to you because we are now in the endgame. Julian needs his freedom urgently and Australia plays a crucial role in securing his release. I recognise many faces in the room today – you have played a crucial role in the fight for the freedom of my husband. I [would] like to take this opportunity to thank the Australian parliamentary friends of Julian Assange who have created a political environment of which support for him has gone beyond party political affiliation. The show of unity has made it possible for leadership to take a position. (continued from previous post) Wallace said the opposition believed that the only members that should sit on the committee “should be parties of government” (that means the Coalition and Labor). He said that had been the convention since the committee was established, with only one exception (when independent Andrew Wilkie was on the committee during the Gillard minority government; there is speculation he could be in line to come back). Before Wallace’s speech, the Labor chair of the committee, Peter Khalil, told parliament the planned changes would increase the committee’s overall membership by two as part of a push for “increased flexibility”. Khalil said the fact the Coalition wrote a dissenting report was “disappointing” but added: The changes that are proposed ... do not change the appointment process or the key requirement that the government of the day have a majority on the committee. For more on this issue, see our story from last week: Coalition voices concerns about possible crossbench intelligence committee appointment The Coalition is reprising its concerns that the federal government could be planning to appoint at least one crossbench member to the parliament’s powerful intelligence committee. Andrew Wallace, the former speaker who is now deputy chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, has told the House of Representatives: Politics goes in cycles and those opposite should always remember that. Wallace said the opposition was “greatly concerned” that proposed changes to the law to add another two members to the committee was “as a result of some deal done between the government and the crossbench” and that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, intends to appoint at least one member of the crossbench. (continued in next post) (Continued from previous post) Shoebridge said the commonwealth was refusing to tender the affidavits to court. “So we’re left with this situation,” he said: You’re not telling the court and you’re not telling parliament - who are you going to tell about why you didn’t give a single defendant a copy of the Corner report despite having it in the department’s hands for two years? Shoebridge peppered Pezzullo with questions about these comments from supreme court justice Elizabeth Hollingworth, who told a directions hearing she still had not seen a “satisfactory explanation for the non-disclosure of the Corner report”: There is still quite a deafening silence from people high up in home affairs about what happened. The government does not want this explored in court. That’s pretty clearly the position … [what] happened in relation to the Corner report is a disgrace. The government solicitor quite properly concedes it should always have been disclosed. Blind Freddy, looking at the legislation, would have said it should have been disclosed. A previous judge of this court, three court of appeal judges, who all heard arguments about the validity of this, did so without this disclosure being made. Why is the commonwealth playing ducks and drakes as a model litigant? It’s put these affidavits in, presumably to try to placate the court, but not wanting to tender them, because heaven help us that we actually have a court hearing about why we didn’t disclose this clearly disclosable document. Corner report questions home affairs terror attack modelling tool’s ‘validity and reliability’ Lawyers and defendants were never told about the serious doubts cast on a tool used to predict the chances of an individual committing a terror attack, senate estimates has heard. Dr Emily Corner assessed the VERA-2R modelling tool, and found the “lack of evidence” underpinning it had “serious implications for [its] validity and reliability”. Greens senator David Shoebridge accused the department of home affairs of keeping the Corner report secret for two years. Department head, Mike Pezzullo, said different academics would come to different conclusions and that the department had gone on to commission a new report from the Australian Institute of Criminology. “It’s clear to me that all psychological or psycho-analytical models are going to have limitations in terms of the predictive quality but decision makers [in the context of deciding whether to issue continuing detention orders where there is a risk of future offending] have to be able to rely upon something,” he said. He refused to answer further questions on the basis that two relevant cases are still before the courts, while a department official said the attorney general’s department was now responsible for the matter. (continued in next post) Peter Dutton, Linda Burney and Bridget McKenzie first speakers in House debate on Indigenous voice referendum bill The debate on the constitutional amendment for the Indigenous voice referendum is about to begin in the House of Representatives. We’re expecting this debate to consume a lot of this week, with something like 70 speakers already listed (of the 151 members) to make a contribution. Leader of the house and arts minister, Tony Burke, took some time this morning to point out some special conventions of this debate, saying all members who want to speak on it will be given the opportunity (this doesn’t always happen due to time constraints in the parliamentary program or sometimes the government just wanting to zoom a bill through the parliament). He also said that on the third reading, a division will be automatically called, even if no MP actually asks for a vote or if there is a clear majority in favour. Burke said this was due to a constitutional alteration requiring an absolute majority in the parliament to proceed, unlike other bills. He said MPs will be given as much notice as possible of this division, where people’s names are formally recorded as having voted a certain way – not like some divisions that are called at short notice where MPs have to sprint from all corners of the building to get inside the chamber before the bells stop ringing. Burke said the third reading division will be held next week, with this week likely to be all about the speeches only. Peter Dutton, Linda Burney and Bridget McKenzie will be the first speakers on the bill, according to a speakers’ list we’ve seen. Some further interesting contributions will come later from Julian Leeser, the former shadow Indigenous Australians minister who quit the opposition front bench to advocate for the voice; Bridget Archer, the lone Liberal MP so far promising to campaign strongly for the voice; and ministers including Bill Shorten, Ed Husic and Anne Aly. Labor MP Matt Burnell may need to re-watch the 90s classic Speed. Jack Traven did not lose his best friend for Annie Porter’s driving to be disrespected like that. She was catching the bus because she lost her licence for speeding, Matt. The movie is called Speed for a reason. It couldn’t drop below 50mph, but that bus absolutely motored to the airport. It jumped an incomplete bridge, Matt. Honestly, kids today. Over in the house, where it is currently debating a motion put forward by LNP MP Bert van Manen (who we are told has his eye on the shadow assistant treasurer gig recently vacated by LNP colleague Stuart Robert) about the budget. He wants no more broken promises. Which is just meaningless political speak that locks all parties into repeating the mistakes of the past. Fadden byelection set for 15 July The second byelection of the year will be held … on 15 July. That might be a bit over six weeks away, but all parties contesting the Fadden byelection will need to get a wriggle on. The LNP is already planning that. Labor has not yet announced who will represent it. Winning the Gold Coast seat from the opposition would be a HUGE ask, though – bigger even than Aston. The margin is over 10% and that area of the Gold Coast tends to skew conservative in all things – there are quite a few mega churches in the election boundary and the Gold Coast is hard as a general rule, plus there are lots of small businesses who aren’t big fans of Labor at any level. Scathing review of Sydney train network finds recent delays and outages likely to worsen Dipping out of federal politics for a moment for this story: The number of active defects across Sydney’s train network has soared to almost 40,000, as a scathing review finds the performance of the transport system plagued by recent outages and delays is “likely to worsen”. Defects related to infrastructure such as tracks and electrical circuiting – but not the train fleet itself – have increased from about 23,000 in December 2018 to about 37,000 in April this year, and the surge has coincided with plunging on-time performance and spiralling service cancellations. The fragility of Sydney’s train network is largely the result of a network timetable introduced in November 2017 that attempted to maximise utilisation of the system but which was “far too tight to effectively maintain service” and give “adequate access for maintenance of rail infrastructure”, an interim review of Sydney Trains has found. The findings are scathing of the handling of the city’s train system under the previous Coalition government, which found that while black swan events such as Covid, bushfires and floods – as well as protected industrial action and union strikes that peaked last year – affected performance, these factors could not totally explain the overall deterioration of the network since the timetable was introduced in 2017. We will have more on that very soon. 3AW’s Neil Mitchell lays out complaints against ABC to Zoe Daniel Zoe Daniel was a foreign correspondent with the ABC before she was the independent MP for Goldstein, so Melbourne radio 3AW host Neil Mitchell uses more than 8 minutes of an interview with her laying out his complaints with the ABC, including that they don’t use the name of his program if they quote from it. It starts off about issues Stan Grant raised about racial abuse he said he had experienced and the lack of support from the ABC at large in the face of that abuse. Daniel, when she is allowed to get a word in, says: I think on this particular issue in regard to the treatment of Stan and how this played out, there does need to be a really deep look at what happened and what went wrong and what that says about a broader culture in the organisation. I understand that the managing director has already indicated that that that will happen. Barry Humphries to receive state memorial in Sydney in December There will be a state memorial for Barry Humphries at the Sydney Opera House on Friday 15 December 2023 after his family accepted the offer for the honour. Anthony Albanese said it was the right thing to do: Barry Humphries was a much-loved Australian and a huge loss to the arts community. The federal government is working with the NSW Labor government for the event. Humphries died in April aged 89. The memorial will feature dignitaries, family, friends and fans of the late Humphries from across the country and around the world and more details can be found here nsw.gov.au/stateservices (later in the year, given it is still seven or so months away; bookmark it if you’re interested). Independent Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel is serious about wanting to ban gambling ads during broadcasts (streaming included) and says the government needs to get on board with what the community wants: The Australian Communications and Media Authority has itself concluded that an effect of restricting gambling ads during live sport after rule changes came into effect in 2018-19 was simply an increase in gambling ads during non-sport programs – especially between 6pm and 10.30pm when children and teenagers are watching. Not only that, the total volume of gambling spots increased by no less than 50% in 2018-19 after the new regulations came into effect, compared with 2016-17 under the old rules. This is why I am introducing this bill, the Broadcasting Services Act amendment (prohibition of gambling advertisements) bill 2023. It is a direct reflection of community sentiment and I thank all of those from within my community of Goldstein and from around the country who have contacted me in support of this Bill. I acknowledge the groundbreaking work done by Andrew Wilkie and Nick Xenophon as well as the continuing efforts by my fellow crossbenchers, especially Rebekha Sharkie and Kate Chaney. If not us who, if not now, when? It’s time to ban gambling ads. Financial rights advocate calls for legislating on BNPL schemes [Continued from previous post] Karen Cox, chief executive of the Financial Rights Legal Centre, is also urging the government to legislate the regulation of BNPL products rather than relying on an industry code of practice. In our experience, complaints under the … code don’t lead to any real consequence or change in industry practice. It is good to see that BNPL providers will be required to be licensed under the Credit Act, subject to the same dispute resolution options as providers of traditional credit, and subject to some form of responsible lending obligation. It is disappointing BNPL will not be treated the same as all other credit. Great attention will be needed in the drafting of these obligations to make sure they address the harms we see every day. Small-amount, low-cost credit does not equal safe or sustainable lending. Consumer groups welcome BNPL changes but fear reforms do not do enough to protect users Consumer groups and financial counsellors have welcomed the government’s plan to regulate buy now pay later products like Afterpay and Zip, but they are concerned it won’t go far enough to protect vulnerable consumers. The government has announced buy now, pay later (BNPL) products will be regulated as credit products, however won’t apply all the consumer protections mandated for other credit products. The group – including the Consumer Action Law Centre and Choice – are urging the government to include requirements for BNPL providers to check a loan is suitable, regardless of the amount. The Consumer Action Law Centre CEO, Stephanie Tonkin, said: Too many financial counselling clients have multiple BNPL accounts. The government’s approach will only work if there is a requirement for BNPL providers to be part of the credit reporting system, to reduce the risk of over-commitment. It is wrong to assume that just because a loan is for a small amount that it is somehow a lower risk. Small amounts can cause big problems. Strong wages growth a solution, not a cause, for inflation: Chalmers Jim Chalmers told Sky News that wages growth is not the reason we are seeing inflation (just a bit louder for some economists at the back): When it comes to these cost-of-living pressures, decent wages growth is part of the solution, not part of the problem. We don’t have too much inflation in our economy because people are getting paid too much. In fact, for too long now, the best part of the decade, we’ve had wage stagnation from our predecessors’ deliberate wage suppression. We take a different view; we want to see wages growing strongly again in a sustainable way, we want businesses to be productive as well because an important part of dealing with these cost-of-living pressures is making sure that people who work hard can provide for their loved ones. And that’s why we are so pleased and so proud to see the strongest wages growth for more than a decade, the strongest first 12 months in jobs growth for a new government on record, faster jobs growth than the major advanced economies – these are important opportunities and important reminders of what Australians have been able to achieve together under the first 12 months of our government. BNPL changes would bring sector into line with other credit providers So what is the government doing on buy now, pay later, exactly? Stephen Jones says: Under our plan, which was listed as option 2 in our consultation paper, buy now, pay later providers will be required to: hold Australian credit licences; comply with responsible lending obligations; meet statutory dispute resolution and hardship requirements; comply with statutory product disclosure and other information obligations; abide by existing restrictions on unacceptable marketing; and meet a range of other minimum standards in relation to their conduct, and in relation to their products. That would bring the BNPL sector into line with other credit providers and also means Asic will have enforcement powers. The industry will still be consulted before anything is put in place though and the aim is not to burden players: The responsible lending regime will be central to our approach. However, our legislation ensures that the obligations on BNPL providers are scalable and technologically neutral. We will make sure they are the right fit for the risk level of their products. Home affairs department secretary says contracts with PwC being probed The home affairs department has investigated six contracts it has with PricewaterhouseCoopers in the wake of revelations the consultancy giant used secret government information to help other clients minimise their tax. In senate estimates this morning, under questioning from Greens senator Nick McKim, the department secretary Mike Pezzullo said he was applying a Russian proverb to the department’s interactions with PwC: “Trust, but verify”. He said: Obviously, like everyone, I’ve been watching the revelations of what was done with tax sensitive information with concern. I won’t speak for my fellow secretaries but I suspect all of us are doing the same thing. Just as a matter of due diligence, I’ve asked the chief operating officer to look at all the engagements that we’ve had. Knowing everything I know, I’ve asked [deputy secretary Justine Saunders] to take much closer interest, to pay much closer attention and to verify everything that’s been done, especially where there’s a risk of monetary advantage – so market sensitive or tax sensitive or revenue sensitive information. Unless new information comes to light, or the government itself makes a broader decision, I don’t think I can do anything more than I’ve done. Buy now, pay later changes intended to make it safer, not harder, to use, says Stephen Jones Stephen Jones is announcing the proposed changes to buy now, pay later schemes – but does that mean you won’t be able to sign up? He says no, it is just about regulating the industry: We don’t want to make it harder for people who are using buy now, pay later in the way it was intended, but we do want to ensure that we’re lifting the bar to ensure that this form of consumer credit is regulated in a way that makes it safe and affordable to use, that we’re lifting the bar right across the credit market. House of Representatives sitting begins The house sitting has begun, but don’t expect to see the referendum legislation debate resume until around midday or so. So far there are 70 speakers on the speaking list. So that is going to take all week. At least. Australia ‘can be a clean energy export superpower’, says Plibersek Tanya Plibersek’s punishment of having to “debate” Barnaby Joyce each week on network television continues. Asked about the pact the US president, Joe Biden, and Anthony Albanese signed in Japan over the weekend to develop new renewable technologies together, Plibersek said: We’ve always built our wealth on energy exports, and we can be a clean energy export superpower as well. This means that we get a piece of the enormous action in the United States at the moment, the billions of dollars that they’re pumping into renewable energy projects. It means that we can focus on green hydrogen here in Australia. We put $2 billion in in the last budget. It means we can focus on our domestic battery manufacturing industry, the critical minerals that support a renewable energy transition. And, of course it helps us meet our climate change objectives as well. The sooner that we get more renewable energy into our own domestic energy supplies, the sooner the world transitions to more renewable energy the better for the environment and the better for the Australian economy. For some reason, Joyce who wants more coal fired power stations opened, was also asked about this and he said: The boot is full of vacuum cleaners and I’m ready to sell, sell, sell! Look, first of all, it’s not legally binding, but, you know, I understand why the United States want to be involved in critical minerals. I mean, it’s an incredibly important industry. That’s why we invested so much in such things as the Outback Way to connect new critical minerals precincts, the Darwin to Alice Springs railway line, which also assists in the movement of that. But you’ve got to ask the question: are the Labor party ever going to continue on with the construction of these? Sigh. NSW to lift stamp duty thresholds for first-home buyers and undo Perrottet reforms For potential home buyers in NSW, Ben Smee has some news for you: The New South Wales government has vowed to make changes to stamp duty thresholds to allow more first home buyers to access concessions. The government says it will introduce legislation this week to increase thresholds for stamp duty concessions so that five out of six first home buyers pay a reduced rate or no stamp duty. Changes to the first home buyers assistance scheme will mean properties worth up to $800,000 will be exempt from stamp duty, lifting it from $650,000. Concessions will apply to properties worth up to $1m, up from $800,000. The government says that 84% of first home buyers will pay no stamp duty or a reduced rate under the reforms. And for those who have been unable to continue with their morning after learning Instagram was down – I have good news. It is back. Guardian Australia will have fresh posts for you very soon – get a snippet of news along with your memes. Julian Leeser to introduce bill on banning Nazi symbols Looks like Liberal MP Julian Leeser will be introducing his private member’s bill to ban Nazi symbols – the criminal code amendment (prohibition of nazi symbols) bill 2023 – this morning. The government had said it was looking at options (a lot of it comes down to state codes). As with all private members’ bills, it will need the government’s support to pass the house (or even come up for debate, given government controls the house business – which is why so many private members’ bills start in the senate) Greg Jericho: stage-three tax cuts do not address bracket creep for those earning under $120,000 As our economics columnist Greg Jericho has reported, the stage-three tax cuts don’t actually do anything to address bracket creep for anyone earning under $120,000: The Parliamentary Budget Office research estimates that out to the start of the next decade someone on the median income of $49,000 will see bracket creep raise their average tax rate by 5.9%pts while the Stage 3 tax cuts will only reduce their tax rate by 0.9%pts. By contrast someone on $120,000 will see bracket creep cause just a 3.3%pt rise in their average tax which will be completely cancelled out for them by the Stage 3 tax cut. Chalmers justifies stage-three tax cuts, saying they return bracket creep to workers Jim Chalmers did the media round this morning and that included the two major commercial networks. There is nothing in the Nine questioning worth reporting. But stage-three tax cuts did come up in the Seven questioning – but not in a way that will please anyone who is looking for the government to scrap them. Chalmers was asked about bracket creep and said: Our tax take is less than what John Howard’s tax take was as a percentage of the economy – that’s just a fact over the forward estimates. But your broader point – one of the reasons why the budget is recovering is because people are working more and they are earning more, and both of those things are good things. Now, as you know and your viewers probably understand, there are some tax cuts in the system coming in a little over a year away. They kick in at $45,000 and part of the motivation for those tax cuts is to make sure that we can give back some of that bracket creep. Progressive thinktank the Australia Institute is urging people in the public service to come forward if they see something they think needs outside attention: Meanwhile, outside of politics, Instagram is down. Twitter, alas, keeps us all chained. PM to meet with India’s Modi in Australia later this week One of the leaders Anthony Albanese didn’t have a bilateral with at the G7 in Japan this weekend was the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi – that is because the pair have planned bilateral meetings this week, in Australia. Modi is visiting Papua New Guinea and is then on his way to Oz for a visit from 22 May to 24 May. Modi was last in Australia in 2014. Albanese visited earlier this year and received a hero’s welcome, with giant billboards and an awkward trip around a cricket stadium waving at the crowd. Albanese: I am honoured to host Prime Minister Modi for an official visit to Australia, after receiving an extremely warm welcome in India earlier this year. Australia and India share a commitment to a stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Together we have an important role to play in supporting this vision. As friends and partners, the relationship between our countries has never been closer. I look forward to celebrating Australia’s vibrant Indian community with Prime Minister Modi in Sydney. Unlikely to be mentioned is the Modi regime’s growing taste for censorship of its critics. Stella Assange, the wife of imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, is in Australia for the first time to attend a rally calling for his freedom. Assange will address the National Press Club today ahead of the rally on Wednesday, to take place in Sydney’s Hyde park. Her appearance was due to be timed with US president Joe Biden’s now cancelled visit to Australia. She will be speaking among Assange’s family members, as well as Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and whistleblower David McBride. Assange said the Australian people were “committed to Julian’s freedom”, pointing to recent comments by the opposition leader that brought the Coalition in line with Labor agreeing it was time for his release. The unity we see in politics reflects that. It is important to show the Biden administration that Julian’s freedom is not up for debate. It is essential to press freedom, it is essential to justice, and it is essential to its most important ally, Australia. Australians are at the forefront of the global movement to free Julian. I will join the Australian people for the historic Quad rally on the 24th, to show the Biden administration that Julian’s family and country stand firm, even in the president’s absence, and we are backed by many millions who fight for truth and justice around the world. Australia’s big supermarkets increased profit margins through pandemic and cost-of-living crisis, analysis reveals Jonathan Barrett has looked at the profits of the big two supermarket chains and oh boy, does he have a story for you. (But there is no way that company profits are increasing inflation, right?) Australia’s big supermarket chains persistently increased their margins on their food businesses throughout the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis, with critics arguing the pricing decisions are evidence of inflationary profiteering. Guardian Australia analysis of Coles and Woolworths financial accounts over a five-year period show the dominant supermarkets were able to use the pandemic to not just sell more goods, but also increase the amount they profited from sales. The highly lucrative period coincided with a devastating pandemic and subsequent cost-of-living crisis and contrasts with the slowing performance and subdued outlook for the supermarket giants shortly before the outbreak of Covid-19. What does that mean? Referendum bill debate to begin in earnest this week The house sitting will begin at 10am today, with estimates hearings to start from 9am. A lot of this week in the house will be taken up by the referendum legislation debate beginning in earnest. It doesn’t look like the government will be making any changes to it, so what you see is what you get – and there are a lot of people who want to have their say on this bill. Fadden LNP prepares to vote in preselection after Stuart Robert’s resignation Meanwhile, in case you missed it yesterday, the LNP is telling Fadden branch members to be ready to vote in a preselection as early as this coming Friday, with the party worried about being caught on the hop with a byelection announcement. Stuart Robert wrote to the speaker to officially resign, and Milton Dick is considering byelection dates for the Gold Coast seat. Nominations for preselection closed on Friday, but it is going to be a very quick turnaround. We understand five people have nominated, including Fadden branch chair, Fran Ward. So far the fight is between Gold Coast city councillor Cameron Caldwell and doctor and disability advocate Dr Dinesh Palipana, although Ward, a long time LNP player, may upset the apple cart. Either way, we will find out very soon. Greens announce comedian Mandy Nolan as Richmond candidate for 2025 election We are only a year into the Albanese government, but it’s never too early to be prepared, I suppose. The Greens have announced their candidate for Richmond at the next election – Mandy Nolan. The comedian has announced she will challenge Labor’s Justine Elliott for the northern NSW seat, with Nolan only needing a 1.8% swing to win the seat. The Greens plan on using the same strategy they deployed to great success in Brisbane to win – doorknocking. Often and early. Adam Bandt said Richmond was “ground zero for both the climate crisis and the housing crisis: people are still reeling from the floods and the rental market’s cooked, with out-of-town investors gouging prices”; he said the electorate was primed to hear the Greens’ message. At the last election people were desperate to kick out the Liberals, but now they’re realising Labor also wants new coal and gas, which makes the climate crisis worse, as well as billions in handouts for property moguls, which pushes up rents and house prices. Labor has no plan whatsoever to help renters and Labor’s housing bill sees the crisis get worse. Mandy’s already got a team of volunteers ready to hit the streets and talk to Richmond residents about how the Greens are the only party fighting for renters and climate action. Senate estimates today Coming up in estimates today is: The Finance and Public Administration Committee (which includes department of parliamentary services and prime minister and cabinet). The Legal and Constitutional Affairs committee, where it will be the Department of Home Affairs show. The Environment and Communications committee will hear from the climate change and energy department as well as environment and water. (So power prices will dominate this one). And there is also rural and regional affairs, where it will be the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (so infrastructure cuts). Government involvement in childcare workers’ push for pay rise would be premature, Chalmers says Jim Chalmers is also asked about the push from childcare workers to receive a pay rise (25%) in their sector, after missing out in the budget. He says asking the government to get involved at this point is a bit premature. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to start writing checks for a process that isn’t under way or hasn’t concluded. … One of the motivations for multi-employer bargaining, which we put in place a few months ago, was because we are concerned that the big workforces in the care economy – workforces often dominated by women – have been underpaid, and multi-employer bargaining is designed to try and rectify that. So there is a process for early childhood educators to go through. No doubt they and their union will go through that process and if there’s any government response, which is necessary, obviously we’ll contemplate that at the time. The treasurer is also being grilled about the PwC scandal. If you need a catch-up on what happened, Henry Belot has you covered: But given the breach of trust, what is Jim Chalmers and the government doing? I don’t want to detail it now and I think you’ll understand why because there are a range of issues at play here. But I will have more to say about how we crack down on this behaviour which is inexcusable, frankly, particularly when you consider that corporate Australia, for the right reasons, wants to be consulted on changes that impact them. And I want to do that too – that’s really one part of the character of this government, is consultation. But in order to do that, you’ve got to be able to trust the process. That trust has broken down here. We need to fix it. We’ve taken some steps already and there’ll be more steps as well. Regulation needed for buy now, pay later sector, treasurer says Over on ABC radio RN, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is talking about the coming changes to the buy now, pay later sector. Chalmers says the government isn’t interested in shutting it down, but that it does need regulation: Really this is about recognising that buy now, pay later has become really popular, something like 7 million accounts; it’s got a legitimate role to play. But there is the potential for harm and that harm falls disproportionately, so it’s time to legislate and regulate. [With] buy now pay later we’ve done a heap of consultation already, [and] there’ll be more to come. But if you make it a regulated credit product under the Credit Act, we can better manage some of the risks that people are aware of and here’ll be appropriate transition arrangements. We want people who can afford to participate in buy now, pay later to be able to access it, but there needs to be the right rules and regulations around it Transforming whole transport system would also make communities more livable, says expert [continued from previous post] In total, Australians would need to take 3.5 times more trips on public transport, and triple the amount of trips they made by walking or cycling. Dr Jennifer Rayner, the Climate Council’s head of advocacy, said that while there had been a lot of focus on increasing uptake of electric vehicles as a solution, the problem of reducing transport emissions required “a bigger rethink”: Enabling more Australians to choose public and active transport – like walking and bike riding – can drive down emissions while also delivering cleaner air, less congestion and make our communities much more livable. Luckily, we have the technology we need to deliver this right now. Governments need to step up and invest in reliable and accessible services and infrastructure – particularly in outer suburban and regional areas. This will make it easier for more people to choose public and active transport for more of their daily trips. Triple public transport uptake and halve car use to ensure Australia’s net zero success, report says Australians need to halve the number of car trips they take and triple their use of public transport by 2030 if the country is to reach net zero emissions, new research has shown. A report by the Climate Council of Australia, released on Monday, argues that as transport contributes to 19% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, the system needs to be fundamentally transformed to shift the behaviour of Australians away from car use and towards cycling, walking, and public transport. This would require state and territory governments to “dramatically increase” the investment in public transport from the “pitiful two percent of transport budgets, or less, that most governments spend today” to 50%, the report said. To achieve this would require expansion and electrification of the public transport system and the establishment of “well-connected infrastructure” for “active modes” of transport like walking and cycling. Labor’s Josh Burns pushing party to go further on EPBC Act changes to stop logging Meanwhile, Labor MP Josh Burns wants the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act reforms his government has ordered to go further to stop logging. That’s interesting for a number of reasons: that Burns is publicly pushing his party to go further makes sense – his inner Melbourne seat is one of the ones targeted by the Greens and there is a lot of support for further action among his constituents. But it also looks as if he wants to stop logging at Toolangi, a forest which is the subject of several petitions to save it from any further logging. Burns says: I sincerely hope to see the native forests that still exist preserved for conservation and recreation. It’ll mean generations to come will have a sporting chance at seeing the endangered wildlife we are duty bound to protect. I am proud to be working with Minister Plibersek on her proposed reforms to the EPBC Act, under which new environmental standards will be applied to state-level Regional Forest Agreements.’ I have visited the Toolangi State Forest, north of Healesville, several times, both with VicForests and with the environmental activists who have taken legal action to stop VicForest’s plans to log parts of the forest. While parts of the State Forest contain eucalypt regrowth from the 1939 bushfires, it also contains breathtaking old-growth native trees, including the majestic Mountain Ash. The Mountain Ash is not only one of the world’s tallest tree species, but it is also contains the highest density of carbon in the world – storing about 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare, which is more than the Amazon forest in Brazil.’ Toolangi is also one of the few remaining refuges of the Leadbeater possum, a critically endangered species, as well as greater gliders and other rare and precious Victorian wildlife species. Zoe Daniel to introduce private members’ bill to crack down on gambling ads during sports broadcasts After Peter Dutton used his budget reply speech to talk about the need to end gambling ads during sports broadcasts, Zoe Daniel celebrated because it meant she should have support for the private members’ bill she had flagged to do the same thing. Daniel, along with members of the crossbench, have been pushing for action on gambling advertisements during sports broadcasts – across all platforms – for some time. They have the evidence and the stories to back up their calls for a ban – and yet, despite the evidence of harm, there has been an increase in the ads. Daniel says given the prime minister is “annoyed” by the ads and the opposition leader “has ‘had enough’”, it is time to do something. She will introduce her bill later today: I’m here to tell them that the ordinary sports lovers who’ve been responding to me in droves are mad as hell and won’t take it any more,” Daniel will say. That is why for some months now I have been preparing a private members’ bill for an outright ban on gambling advertising on our screens; broadcast television, pay TV and their respective streaming services. The PM has said the government wants to see the results of the committee inquiry into online gambling – Daniel says that doesn’t cover the “blizzard of gambling ads seen by the tens of thousands of sports lovers, many of them impressionable teenagers, watching their favourite codes on free-to-air TV, pay TV and their streaming services”. We cannot wait – these seductive advertisements are an electronic epidemic normalising betting as integral to sport, grooming young minds, impairing mental health, encouraging gambling addiction and causing financial distress. We can wait no longer. Let’s see how the major parties deal with that. Welcome to the first week of estimates, where the government’s spending will be put under a microscope and Penny Wong’s eyebrows get a work out – except now they are on the other side of the table. There is no Senate sitting this week (or next) as the senators take up their chance to prod the government and departments about all sorts of things, which means no legislation will be passed for the next fortnight. That leaves room for the house to get through some of its own business – namely the voice to parliament referendum legislation debate which will begin in earnest this week and will dominate the proceedings. Because it is a debate over the voice referendum, there is no set time – anyone who wants a say gets one, and there are A LOT of MPs lining up to have their say. So expect those speeches to take up most of the week. Anthony Albanese arrived back in Canberra late last night after his G7/Quad visit to Japan and he will be straight back into domestic issues – the referendum legislation is important to him, plus there is the one-year anniversary of his government to acknowledge and then there is the housing bill to get across the line. So far, there has been no budge on the housing bill, with the Greens laying out their demands for more and the government not overly enthused with picking any of them up. But given the state of the housing market and that people are sleeping on mattresses in sheds, cars and tents – working parents and their kids, pensioners, young people, singles, you name it – this is not an issue where the government has a lot of political capital. People just want it fixed. Independent MP Zoe Daniel will also introduce her private members’ bill later today to end gambling ads on broadcast TV and streaming – and she expects support from both sides of the chamber, given both leaders have spoken about the need to do something about gambling. And the financial services minister, Stephen Jones, will officially announce the plans to regulate the buy now, pay later sector – that’s things like Afterpay and Zip. He is giving a speech to the Responsible Lending and Borrowing Conference where he will announce the BNPL services will be treated as a credit product – which means providers will need to have a credit licence and minimum standards of conduct. It’s been a long time coming – BNPL schemes have seen a lot of people run into credit trouble – given there is not a lot you need to sign up beyond an email address – but Jones says they should be treated the same as credit cards. So it’s a big week and a pretty big day. You have Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst in Canberra, with Mike Bowers keeping us all up to date. You have me, Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. It is at least a three-coffee morning.

The agreement was signed by defence minister Win Bakri Daki and US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who flew into the country early on Monday, in the place of US president Joe Biden. Before signing the agreements, prime minister James Marape defended himself against claims it could encroach on the country’s sovereignty after a leaked draft document suggesting it gives US personnel and contractors legal immunity; allows aircraft, vehicles and vessels operated by or on behalf of the US to move freely within its territory and territorial waters; and exempts US staff from all migration requirements. “The US and PNG have a long history, with shared experiences and this will be a continuation of that same path,” he said. “Papua New Guinea signed a generic SOFA [status of forces] agreement with other countries in 1989, and today with the signing of the ]defence and maritime agreements] it will only elevate the SOFA.” “And this cooperation will help build the country’s defence capacity and capabilities and also address issues such as Illegal fishing, logging and drug smuggling in PNG waters.” Blinken said that the agreement would provide $45m to help improve security cooperation and help PNG mitigate the effects of climate change, tackle transnational crime and improve public health. “We are proud to partner with Papua New Guinea, driving economic opportunities and are committed to all aspects of defence and maritime cooperation,” he said. Blinken told Pacific Leaders that the US was here to listen and find ways on how they can improve and do better in helping the Pacific. PNG’s location just north of Australia makes it strategically significant. It was the site of fierce battles during the second world war, and with a population of nearly 10 million people, is the most populous Pacific island nation. However, many in the Pacific are concerned about the increasing militarisation of the region and that Papua New Guinea could be stuck between an increasingly hostile US and China. Civil society groups and student unions have raised concerns over the defence cooperation agreement, with talks of protests spreading online over the weekend. Students at several universities have held protests against the signing of the agreement, amid concerns it will upset China. In response to news of Blinken’s visit to PNG, China warned against the introduction of “geopolitical games” to the region. PNG also welcomed India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Monday. Marape hailed India as the “leader of the global south” and promised to rally behind it as Modi held a summit there with Pacific island leaders. Modi told the 14 leaders of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation that India would be a reliable partner to small island states amid difficulties caused by supply chain disruptions and the climate crisis. India was committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific, he said. Earlier, Modi wrote on social media he had discussed “ways to augment cooperation in commerce, technology, healthcare and in addressing climate change” in a bilateral meeting with Marape on Monday. Blinken arrived in Port Moresby around 1am on Monday, travelling in Biden’s place after the US president was forced to cancel his plans to make a brief but historic stop there to sign the pact. Biden would have become the first sitting US president to visit a Pacific island, but he cancelled to focus on debt limit talks in Washington, prompting concerns about how reliable a partner the US is in the Pacific. Blinken said that the US and the Pacific shared a long history, “and whilst we get inspiration from the past, today is not about the past, but the future, and how we can work together. “We also have have shared priorities such as tackling the climate crisis, advancing inclusive economic growth for the people of the Pacific Islands, and highlighting the US commitment to realise a prosperous, resilient, and secure Pacific Islands region.” “I am grateful to be here and want to hear from all of you, on how we can do better and improve the US Pacific relationship,” he said. Blinken also conveyed Biden’s invitation to Pacific Islands leaders to visit Washington, DC, later this year for the second US summit with the Pacific Islands Forum. Marape thanked Blinken and welcomed him saying that, “whilst short, your visit demonstrates your country’s commitment to further enhance and add value to our existing bilateral ties with the view to progressing it to the next level”. “We welcome you to the Pacific, to PNG and thank you for coming to Port Moresby.” The former prime minister Peter O’Neill accused Marape of placing the country “at the epicentre of a military storm between China and the USA by agreeing to enter into defence arrangements with both superpowers without consultation with our people”. The opposition leader, Joseph Lelang, said last week: “We have a foreign policy of ‘friends to all and enemies to none’. We … should not be blinded by the dollar sign or be coerced into signing deals that may be detrimental to us in the long run.” Marape said on Monday there would be an increased presence of US military personnel and contractors over the next two years but that a US military base would not be established."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/tories-conspiracy-theories-cultural-marxism-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T09:00:33Z","webTitle":"The Tories have form with far right conspiracy theories.

This time it’s ‘cultural Marxism’","bodyText":"This week, London played host to the National Conservatism conference, an orgy of rightwing anxieties about threats to the west and the future of Conservatism. The lineup saw an eclectic coalition of rightwing firebrands raising the alarm about the left’s purported plans for world domination via a “woke revolution”. The fascistic undertones of this conspiratory narrative – which effectively calls on conservatives to save their country from an insidious alliance between progressives and minorities – sounded particularly pronounced during a speech by Tory MP Miriam Cates. Describing falling birthrates as “the one overarching threat to British conservatism, and to the whole of western society”, she laid blame for Britain’s woes at a surprise foe: “a cultural Marxism that is systematically destroying our children’s souls”. What is cultural Marxism? The term, which emerged in the 1990s in the US with clear antisemitic origins, imagines that an anti-western ideology was concocted by Jewish intellectuals after the second world war. The conspiracy taps into confected panics about political correctness and wokeness that first started in the US. Only in more recent years has it captured the minds of Conservatives in Britain as well. In March 2019, Suella Braverman declared that “we are engaged in a battle against cultural Marxism”, tying the threat to Jeremy Corbyn. In November 2020, 22 Conservative MPs and peers then signed a letter criticising “cultural Marxist dogma”. Each utterance brings fresh calls from Jewish groups and leaders to stop the usage and exploitation of the term. But for the Tories the allure of a phantom threat destroying Britain from the inside – exonerating the party for its dismal 13 years in government – is too good to turn down. It’s tempting to frame the Conservatives’ flirtations with conspiratorial thinking as an aberration. But the truth is that the party has always contained darker, apocalyptic undercurrents. These are usually repressed and marginalised in the interests of electability – politeness, levelheadedness and respectability are essential to the party’s brand – but at times of crisis, when Conservatives fear for the future and feel threatened by social trends evolving beyond their control, they often rise to the surface. In many ways, the foundational challenge for the Conservative party has been how to harness the most reactionary forces of society while also keeping the party’s moderate reputation untarnished by them. This balancing act – embracing the far right with one arm, keeping them at a distance with the other – has caused all kinds of contortions in the party’s past: from Margaret Thatcher dismissing the National Front as a “socialist front” at the same time as it accused her of stealing its rhetoric and policies, to David Cameron mocking Ukip as “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” and then surrendering to its main demand for an in/out referendum. However much they might not like it, Conservatives know that their winning coalition usually requires keeping those “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” on side. But the Conservatives’ reactionary tendencies are also more than mere tactics. Between the two world wars, when fascist leaders came to power across Europe, many Conservatives succumbed to fascism’s core conspiracy: that Jews and communists were in cahoots against the west. The Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin tried his best to dissuade his party from fascism. “Fascism … takes many of the tenets of our own party and pushes them to a conclusion which, if given effect to, would … be disastrous to our country,” he warned. But dozens of Tories funded, founded or joined fascist groups such as the British Union of Fascists and the Anglo-German Fellowship. Fascism is often associated with thugs, but in Britain, as elsewhere, it was often an upper-class affair. Not even the greatest heroes of the Conservative party have been immune to these prejudices. The fact that Winston Churchill helped to defeat Hitler doesn’t change the fact that he indulged in antisemitic conspiracy theories, too. In 1920, Churchill suggested that “international Jews” were leading a “worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation”. He wondered whether the Jewish heritage of many revolutionary leftwing thinkers – Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Emma Goldman – spoke to “inherent inclinations rooted in Jewish character and religion”. Like other Tories, Churchill was ultimately stirred into action not by Hitler’s antisemitism or his fascism, but by “the threatening continental expansionism that it inspired in Germany”, as the historian Priya Satia has explained, which endangered Britain and its empire. Arch-imperialist and Conservative politician Leo Amery believed that, on matters of race, Churchill was “not quite sane”, suggesting that here there was little difference “between his outlook and Hitler’s”. The Conservatives’ impressive feat is knowing how to tap into reactionary forces one moment, and how to dissociate the party from them the next. After the second world war, as the evils of fascism entered national folklore, the Conservatives committed to cleaning up their image. Fascist sympathies and antisemitism were no longer tolerated as understandable eccentricities. In early 1953, a young Jewish man named Sir Keith Joseph, who would later go on to become Thatcher’s right-hand man, approached the party about becoming an MP. John Hare, Conservative vice-chairman for candidates, immediately saw his value. “There is a good deal of talk about antisemitic prejudice within the party and his adoption, therefore, by some constituency would be helpful,” he said. The remarkable diversity of the Conservative cabinet – unmatched anywhere else in the western world – is testament to the party’s power of adaptability. But their recent readiness to indulge conspiracy theories and reactionary rhetoric suggest the embrace of multicultural Britain was always more a matter of expedience than enthusiasm. Contained within invocations of “cultural Marxism” is a vast constellation of more mundane conservative anxieties about the modern world, from the culture of victimhood supposedly enabled by universities to the erosion of family values. Conservatives now claim they simply want to restore a respect for tradition and a sense of personal responsibility among young people, undoing the damage done by the left. But they should perhaps ask whether they are in fact the architects of their own unhappiness – whether the erosion of traditional values and rise of identity politics has more to do with the free-market capitalism they have championed so fervently than any nebulously defined cultural Marxism. “I sometimes wonder,” Norman Tebbit confessed in 2013, “whether our economic reforms led to an individualism in other values, in ways we didn’t anticipate.” Most Conservatives prefer to avoid any such reckoning. This is now the paradoxical core of conservative psychology: a cult of personal responsibility that refuses to take any responsibility for the world that, through its promotion of free-market capitalism, it has in large part created. It’s clear they will conjure up all kinds of conspiracies to avoid confronting this unhappy truth.

The pregnancy had been straightforward and full of nervous excitement, but, as crisis presented itself, Lewis found himself unprepared. “I still can’t talk about it properly now, five years on,” the 35-year-old says. “It was horrific. I didn’t know what was going on and I couldn’t do anything except stand by and watch as my wife and my baby’s lives were potentially in danger. The whole thing was a blur, but it felt like it would go on for ever.” An hour or so later, his son was delivered. His wife was fine and the baby was healthy. Yet the memory of the traumatic birth kept replaying in Lewis’s mind, long after the family returned home. “My wife was still recovering from major surgery, so I was left alone with my child, but I didn’t feel that special connection that everyone talks about,” he says. “I just wanted to make sure my wife was OK. My baby became something I had to deal with.” Lewis found himself going through the motions of parenting – sleeping fitfully each night, changing nappies constantly, looking on while mother and child bonded through breastfeeding – but he struggled to connect with his child. He began to feel deeply sad, as if there might be something wrong with him; so many other new fathers seemed enamoured of their babies. As he later found out, he was experiencing the symptoms of postnatal depression (PND), which remains largely unexplored in men. PND is well established as a mood disorder that affects women, with between 10% and 15% of mothers thought to experience it. In the UK, new mothers are monitored for PND during routine NHS health visits. New fathers, however, have no access to standardised care or routine checkups on the NHS, despite research finding that up to 10% of them exhibit symptoms. “Both parents are equally susceptible to mental health challenges during and after birth,” says Dr Sharin Baldwin, the clinical academic lead for nursing at the London north west university healthcare NHS trust. “Recent years have seen caring responsibilities become shared and there is an expectation that dads need to be more involved. That combination can create more pressure on men who want to be good dads, but might feel as if they’re not good enough or that they can’t burden their partners with their own worries.” Baldwin, a health visitor, is one of the few researchers to study the prevalence of postnatal depression in men. Her interest in the topic began when her husband told her how he felt excluded by child health services after the birth of their first child, with each piece of literature or help for infants seemingly naming only “mothers and babies”. She began a three-part New Dad Study in 2016, interviewing 21 men from different ethnicities and backgrounds about their experiences of having children. She found that a number of themes tied them together. “A lot of the men spoke about their exhaustion with having to go back to work and still care for their children when they were at home, as well as the difficulty in being separated from them,” she says. “There were also concerns raised about expectations not matching with reality, like dads being surprised that their partner might struggle with breastfeeding and then feeling as if they weren’t able to help. Ultimately, their issues might not feel as important as the birthing partner’s and so they often neglect their own needs.” Lewis felt conflicted when he went back to work after two weeks of parental leave. “The office was really tiring, but I needed the break from being at home,” he says. “I felt so guilty when I got back, for missing out, as well as sometimes relieved. I didn’t want to make life harder for my wife by telling her.” Nonetheless, she noticed his apathy and his fluctuating mood; she encouraged him to seek help. “She told me that if I didn’t sort this out now it would affect our son’s life and our relationship,” he says. “She didn’t want me to work myself to the bone and not be present any more.” After being put on a waiting list for NHS counselling, Lewis decided to pay for private sessions so that he could start immediately. “A few months in, I began to make sense of my feelings and realise that the birth had been hard for both of us,” he says. “It really helped being able to talk about it and the weight lifted. I could begin to feel unconditional love for my boy. I wish I had known earlier that, even though there might be a lack of connection initially, it would come.” Baldwin says PND can affect men who have adopted children, as well as those in same-sex couples; there can be an expectation to parent without complaint after going through a lengthy adoption or surrogacy process. “Support is really important,” she says. “If men don’t have a social network within which they can talk or share their feelings, they might feel cut off and then things can get worse.” *** When James, 38, became a father, he felt extremely isolated. After he and his partner had gone through two unsuccessful rounds of IVF and begun to look into adoption, she became pregnant naturally in 2019 and gave birth to their “miracle baby” at the height of the Covid pandemic. “The lockdowns meant that we were almost entirely alone, which became really hard,” he says. “We had gone through so much to have a child and I was so excited for her arrival that I wasn’t expecting how tough it might be. I felt awful.” Sleeping only four or five hours a night, James became deeply affected by his daughter’s screams, anticipating their arrival and sometimes hearing noises when there were none. “It felt like there was no escape, especially since we couldn’t even really go outside,” he says. “Everyone else was also having their own difficult experiences of Covid, so there wasn’t much space to share how I was feeling. I kept everything inside and began to dread the long nights.” Ian Coleman, a therapist with the Counselling Directory, describes the “doom loop” that he encounters with new fathers who come to him for help. “Men can have these traditionally masculine notions of needing to cope, which means they don’t talk about their feelings and then they feel guilt at not doing well, which makes the depression worse,” he says. “Caring for yourself can be seen as selfish, but it’s necessary. Men often don’t have a roadmap for fatherhood and they might not want to repeat how their own fathers were, so they need perspective to understand that their lives are objectively difficult in those moments.” James says his father was largely absent, busy at work, when he was growing up. He was determined to be more hands on with his daughter, even if he was struggling. “I didn’t even know men could get postnatal depression, but as the lockdowns lifted and I reconnected with my friends and family, I asked the other dads I knew about their experiences and they began telling me how hard it had been for them, too,” he says. The pressure James had been feeling began to subside and he felt as if he could parent on his own terms. “Looking back now, I can’t believe there isn’t more awareness about the issue and that there aren’t more resources available, since it seems so common,” he says. *** The PND support charity Pandas has seen its private Facebook group for new fathers grow to 800 members since it was established in 2020. There has been a “slow but steady increase” in people reaching out to its support services specifically for men, says Annie Belasco, who runs the charity. She says the mental health of new dads is often overlooked. “With 25% to 50% of fathers experiencing anxiety or depression when the mother also has a perinatal mental illness, the demand will only grow.” Baldwin agrees, noting the need for more resources. “We need national guidance to assess fathers routinely. Health visiting numbers in England have dropped by 40% since 2015 and, with this disinvestment, we struggle to identify fathers who need more support,” she says. “Between 8% and 10% of fathers might experience PND, but those are only the ones that we know about. The real figure could be higher.” As research into men’s mental health develops, with studies finding that fathers go through hormonal changes after birth, it seems clear that awareness of the realities of fatherhood needs to be increased. The stigma is still prevalent – as evinced by the fact that each man I spoke to about their experiences did not want to share their full name. “It’s difficult to admit that something as natural as fatherhood has been so hard for you, but it feels important to do it,” Lewis says. “Us dads need to look after ourselves, as well as our partners and kids.” Five years after that emergency C-section, Lewis’s son has started school and Lewis and his wife have had another child. “I love them both so deeply,” he says. “Even though it has been really tough at points, they are the best parts of my life.” Some names have been changed • In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

Joe Biden and the House Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, have held a “productive” phone call on the continued impasse over the debt ceiling and promised to meet today after the president returned to Washington. McCarthy, speaking to reporters after the call, said there were positive discussions on solving the crisis and that staff-level talks were set to resume later on Sunday. Asked if he was more hopeful after talking to the president, McCarthy said: “Our teams are talking today and we’re … meeting tomorrow. That’s better than it was earlier. So, yes.” Biden, who arrived back at the White House late yesterday evening after his trip to Japan, said the call with McCarthy had gone well. “We’ll talk tomorrow,” he added. Speaking from the G7 summit in Japan on Sunday, Biden said he would be willing to cut spending together with tax adjustments to reach a deal, but that the latest offer from Republicans on the ceiling was “unacceptable”. What will happen if a deal isn’t struck? Less than two weeks remain until the 1 June deadline, upon which the Treasury department has said the federal government could be unable to pay all its debts. Without raising the debt limit, the US government will default on its bills, a historic first, with likely catastrophic consequences. Federal workers would be furloughed, global stock markets would crash and the US economy would probably drop into a recession. US and Papua New Guinea sign security agreement amid Pacific militarisation concerns The US has signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea amid concerns inside the country about increasing militarisation as the US competes with China for influence in the Pacific. The state department said the agreement would provide $45m to help improve security cooperation, including protective equipment for the PNG defence force, plus help in mitigating the effects of climate change, tackling transnational crime and HIV/Aids. But a draft copy of the defence cooperation agreement leaked last week sparked concern in PNG about the extent of US military involvement in the country, with reports it gives US personnel and contractors legal immunity, allows aircraft, vehicles and vessels operated by or on behalf of the US to move freely within its territory and territorial waters and exempts US staff from all migration requirements. Students at several universities have held protests at campuses against the signing of the agreement, amid concern it would upset China. What has PNG’s prime minister said? James Marape denied that US staff would have legal immunity and said no amendments would be made to the constitution or laws of the country. He said the country faced significant security challenges. “I need to strengthen and protect my country’s borders and ensure the safety of my people,” he said. “So this has nothing to do with geopolitics, this cooperation will strengthen our defence and help build our capacity.” Bakhmut remains ‘epicentre’ of combat, Ukraine’s armed forces say Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out airstrikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” What else happened at the G7 summit? The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit. Lula da Silva said he was “upset” they did not manage to meet, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. Why is China upset? Beijing has accused the G7 nations of collaborating to “smear and attack” China, after the weekend summit issued a communique that warned Beijing over its “militarisation activities” in the Asia-Pacific region. After the summit, China summoned the Japanese ambassador to register an official protest, and warned the UK to stop “slandering” the country to avoid further damage to bilateral relations.

Visible from the I-10 highway, it is an improbable sight: a deep blue slick stretching for miles across the Chuckwalla Valley, forming an endless glistening mirror. But something’s not quite right. Closer up, the water’s edge appears pixelated, with the look of a low-res computer rendering, like frozen waves. Over the last few years, this swathe of desert has been steadily carpeted with one of the world’s largest concentrations of solar power plants, forming a sprawling photovoltaic sea. On the ground, the scale is almost incomprehensible. The Riverside East Solar Energy Zone – the ground zero of California’s solar energy boom – stretches for 150,000 acres, making it 10 times the size of Manhattan. But experts warn environmental damage means it is ‘solving one problem by creating others’. Last Thing: Couple who helped Koreans stranded in US blizzard feted as heroes in Seoul A US husband and wife who sheltered 10 South Korean travelers in their home during a deadly snowstorm last Christmas have gone to Seoul and been feted as heroes. Alexander and Andrea Campagna went to South Korea’s capital as part of a 10-day tour of the city organized as a token of gratitude for the husband and wife who opened up their home in Buffalo, New York, to strangers in need. “To see everyone in Korea again is such a blessing,” Andrea Campagna, 43, told reporters in Seoul in reference to those whom she and her husband aided. “They ended up in the right place at the right time. Now we have people we can call friends for a lifetime.” The blizzard on 23 December that brought together the Campagnas and their newfound Korean friends was brutal. Officials said more than 22in of snow fell in Buffalo that day, and 40 people died for reasons linked to the blizzard, which the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, memorably described as “a war with Mother Nature”.

This like a dream Keeps other time And daytime is The loss of this; For time is inches And the heart’s changes Where ghost has haunted Lost and wanted. But this was never A ghost’s endeavour Nor finished this, Was ghost at ease; And till it pass Love shall not near The sweetness here Nor sorrow take His endless look. Commenting on Auden’s poetic development in the early 1930s, Edward Mendelson, editor of the magisterial Princeton University Press edition of the Complete Works quotes a review of a poetry collection by Louise Bogan, where Auden provides an undercover description of his own younger practice. “Poems at this stage,” Auden wrote, “are usually short, made up of magical lyric phrases which seem to rise involuntarily to the consciousness.” If there could be a better short summary of Poem XVII than “magical lyric phrases” I don’t know what it could be. The first few lines immediately conjure a vision of bright moonlight on the words and the page; the whole poem works its lyrical magic before the words are properly understood. Part of me always wants to leave it there, radiant and beyond interpretation. But, of course, Auden as usual has something complex and interesting to say, and a superb technique with which to say it. At first glance, the poem looks formal. It might be a 20th-century Elizabethan song, with verses cut to a regular length. Only they’re not: the first verse has seven lines, the second eight, the third nine – two odd numbers bookending an even one. It’s as if even at the most basic level of form, there’d been a decision both to reflect stasis – the immutable “lunar beauty”– and the movement of time. In the crucial line in verse two, “time is inches”, and one might add that time is also the pulse of the poem, the dimeter rhythm carrying the thought from line to line, the sonic pattern of assertions and echoes. The rhymes are arranged mostly in triplets and couplets. Verse one begins with a triplet, “beauty”, “history” and “early” connected melodically by their -y endings. The second verse, unusually, has a quatrain at its core: “is”, “this”, “inches”, “changes”. It resembles a string quartet with the deeper notes sounding out from the twinned two-syllable words. In the last verse, the end-words tend to rhyme more closely, even in the triplet’s consonantal cluster, “this”, “ease”, “pass”. In the last couplet “take” and “look” have the click of a lock that might either close or open the poem. As important to the melody is the variation of feminine and masculine line endings. All the endings in verse one are feminine. In the last verse only the first two are. Whether or not this fluidity has the effect of gendering and re-gendering the poem, it sets up a tension between a “dying fall” in the cadence and an assertive stress. Although the adjective “lunar” is ambiguous, it’s difficult for the reader not to imagine the presence of either the moon or a moonlit object. If an object, what could it be, since it “has no history / is complete and early”? Some extremely ancient artefact? A stone? A very youthful face? A poem from two decades later, Nocturne 1, is an interesting subject for comparison. This is definitely a poem with a moon in it, and an argument about whether the moon is best seen as “goddess” or “faceless dynamo”. Auden in his maturity seeks balance: he reduces the lyricism, and some of the magic, but powerfully finds a counter-image, with the power to banish “my world, the private motor-car / And all the engines of the state”. The moon in “this lunar beauty”’ – if we insist on one “– is certainly not the woman she is in Nocturne 1. Imagine it embodied, and we might see the unusual figure of a moon-god. Appearing at the end of verse two, the ghost has a particular significance. Auden’s phrase “family ghosts” (also referenced in Mendelson’s introduction) represented for the poet the psychological limitations inherited from parents and upbringing. Might the ghost in the context be a symbol of rejected, but to some degree internalised, disapproval of same-sex love? The syntax is difficult to read here. Is it “the heart’s changes” or the ghost that is “lost and wanted”? Has the haunting caused the heart’s changes? The shadows of loss and wanting are strongly cast, and perhaps continue, against the ghost’s will, in verse three, but this is a phase that seemingly will pass. Meanwhile, a protective circle is drawn round the beauty of the lover, sealing it from censure, shame, regret. In the transcendent moment of adoration, Eros may be a transgression, and the last four lines, part incantation, part blessing, command love not to “near / the sweetness here”. As at the beginning of the poem, the “lunar beauty” exemplifies only itself. The poem was probably written in April 1930. Among the subsequent small changes he records, Mendelson notes that in Auden’s lover Chester Kallman’s copy of Poems (1934), Auden revised the first line to “Your lunar beauty”, but that this change isn’t made in any further printings. The initials JC appear in Kallman’s copy: the identity of JC is unknown. • Poem XVII is reprinted from Poems, Volume I, 1927-1939 by WH Auden, edited by Edward Mendelson (Princeton University Press); copyright 2022 the Estate of WH Auden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/abc-news-chief-regrets-not-defending-stan-grant-earlier-amid-racist-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T08:47:50Z","webTitle":"ABC news chief regrets not defending Stan Grant earlier amid racist attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/abc-news-chief-regrets-not-defending-stan-grant-earlier-amid-racist-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/abc-news-chief-regrets-not-defending-stan-grant-earlier-amid-racist-attacks","fields":{"headline":"ABC news chief regrets not defending Stan Grant earlier amid racist attacks","bodyText":"ABC news chief Justin Stevens says he regrets not defending Stan Grant earlier as the Q+A host faced racist attacks on social media fuelled by what he described as a “relentless campaign” against the ABC’s coronation broadcast from News Corp. Stevens accused News Corp of targeting the ABC because it was “trying to chip away [at] people’s sense of trust in what we do because we threaten their business model”. “I regret not doing this sort of interview 10 days ago,” Stevens told Raf Epstein on ABC Melbourne in response to Grant’s announcement he was stepping down from Q+A after Monday night. Grant targeted ABC management itself for a lack of support and accused the rightwing media of telling lies and distorting his words after he received “grotesque racist abuse” on social media and distortion and lies in the rightwing media. “I am writing this because no one at the ABC – whose producers invited me on to their coronation coverage as a guest – has uttered one word of public support,” he said. Stevens said he had apologised personally to the Wiradjuri journalist - as did the managing director, David Anderson – and he urged News Corp and other media critics to “come after me” rather than target ABC presenters like Grant, Tony Armstrong, Leigh Sales or Lisa Millar. “I’m the person who’s responsible ultimately for the journalism and the decisions,” he said. “I’m saying stop going after people for doing their jobs.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian, Sky News and radio broadcasters Neil Mitchell and Ray Hadley denounced the broadcaster for hosting a panel discussion about the impact of colonialism on Indigenous Australians and the relevance of the monarchy in 2023. Much of the commentary focused on Grant. Stevens said sections of the media engaged in a “piling on” “with a clear agenda” and that they played a part in “amplifying and giving agency” to the racist trolls on social media. He said the level of scrutiny applied to the ABC is not in the public interest and gave the example of a journalist from the Australian asking questions about an Indigenous ABC journalist after they had “pored over their social media”. News Corp has been approached for comment. Stevens earlier addressed a gathering of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff outside the ABC in Sydney who were among staff across the nation to rally in solidarity with Grant. Other staff showed their support on social media. They held signs and chanted “I stand with Stan” and “We reject racism”. Grant’s ex-wife, the SBS journalist Karla Grant, said the abuse had ramped up when he became Q+A host. “The ABC management did nothing about it up until the last couple of days,” Grant told Guardian Australia. “It’s been quite hard for him to have to walk away from the job that he loves. But enough is enough.” The complaint about a lack of institutional support has prompted the ABC’s primary advisory body on issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, the Bonner Committee, to ask Anderson to review how the ABC handles Indigenous staff who are subjected to racism. Anderson announced the review on Sunday. The newly appointed head of Indigenous news at the ABC, Suzanne Dredge, spoke to the gathering in Ultimo, which included supporters from the Indigenous public broadcaster NITV. “We want this to be a turning point for the ABC, for First Nations journalists, the media as a whole and for the Australian community,” Dredge said. “We need to call out racism and do more to address this awful blight on all of us. The impact it has on First Nations communities across the country is devastating. We know First Nations and diverse journalists are targeted more than anyone else on social media.” Grant’s wife, the ABC journalist Tracey Holmes, and Sales, Jeremy Fernandez, Norman Swan, and NITV reporters Lowanna Grant and Lola Forester, as well as Grant’s family, attended the Sydney rally. Stevens acknowledged the First Nations journalists present. “We know you’re hurting,” he said. “And we are here to say we stand alongside you. You are not alone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/22/pierre-novellie-comedy-q-and-a-heckler-diagnosed-my-aspergers","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T08:42:21Z","webTitle":"Pierre Novellie: ‘A heckler diagnosed my Asperger’s so fair play to him’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/22/pierre-novellie-comedy-q-and-a-heckler-diagnosed-my-aspergers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/22/pierre-novellie-comedy-q-and-a-heckler-diagnosed-my-aspergers","fields":{"headline":"Pierre Novellie: ‘A heckler diagnosed my Asperger’s so fair play to him’","bodyText":"Why did you start doing standup? I always wondered if I was funny. Or rather if my private sense of humour, that I shared with very few people, would work on the public. That and being obsessed with comedy meant I was always going to give it a try. Who inspired you when you were starting out? I was inspired as a teenager by watching club comics perform on the various compilation shows of early 00s television (Live at the Store, Comedy Blue, etc) but also by people like Eddie Izzard and Dave Chappelle. When I read Frank Skinner’s descriptions of standup as the freest you can be, I was sold. I had to try it. Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny? Hull. I died so hard you could hear the ice clinking in people’s glasses. Still did my 20 minutes though. Best heckle? 99% of heckles are pointless gibberish. Then again, recently a mild-mannered heckler correctly diagnosed me with Asperger’s so fair play to him. Nailed it. You got diagnosed with ASD last year. Has this affected your standup? It turns out loads of my sensitive, finicky observational comedy routines were the ramblings of an autist, yes. Pretty much every single one can be seen in that light, now. I truly believe the condition to be not only endemic within comedy but maybe even its origin point. Happy to write the book if anyone wants to pay me. What’s your current show about? I explore how my diagnosis has completely reshaped my perception of who I am. Lots of qualities I previously thought made me unique were actually just some of the varied symptoms of a spectrum condition, which is useful knowledge but does take something of a sledgehammer to your sense of self. It’s certainly caused a mild existential crisis. Any preshow rituals? I splash cold water on my face and ears, stretch my hamstrings even though I don’t move around much at all, and I stretch my face by pulling insane faces. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? Many comedy clubs haven’t increased their fees since the noughties and it’s a disgrace – you can bet they’ve increased their ticket prices. Worst advice you’ve ever been given? “You should do a racist South African character on stage.” What are you excited for? I don’t really get excited. I slowly become cautiously optimistic.

In summer, flocks of tourists make the 45-minute crossing from the mainland to sample life on the edge. From the point of view of its 3,000 residents, modern transport and communications have brought them closer to the rest of the country than ever. But now, thanks to Royal Mail, islanders fear they are being returned to isolation. For the last three years, parts of Mull have been cut off from mail deliveries for days. Since March, those days have turned into weeks. Residents have missed hospital appointments, bank cards and passports have been held up, and penalty charge notices gone unpaid. A former postman suggests there are 50 cages of mail bound for Mull stranded in the mainland sorting office in Oban. Last week, households in the village of Dervaig and the surrounding area, a 40-mile postal round, were informed that their temporary postal worker could no longer oblige due to reduced ferry timetables. They would have to collect their post from Tobermory, the main town. That’s a 45-minute round trip over mountain roads for those with a car; an hour on the occasional buses. The tiny Scottish community is one of numerous “postal deserts” across the UK where first-class mail can take two weeks to arrive. From Brighton to Bromley in south London, from Salford to Lerwick, daily deliveries are a privilege of the past as strikes, staff and vehicle shortages plunge Royal Mail’s performance to a record low. Last week, the communications regulator Ofcom announced it was opening an investigation after new figures showed it failed to meet its performance targets for 2022/23. More than 11% of delivery rounds were missed and more than a quarter of first-class mail didn’t arrive within one working day. According to Georgia Satchel, an artist who lives in the north of the island, the universal service obligation, which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters to all UK addresses six days a week, has a vital impact on remote communities. “Living in a beautiful place is a balancing act,” she says. “Weighing up the advantages and disadvantages, the peace and quiet versus the inconvenience and expense. The multi-crises of no postal service and ferry breakdowns is tipping that balance.” Gordon Chalmers, a ex-postman turned delivery driver in Dervaig, missed an urgent cancer referral after receiving no post for a week. “I thought it was strange when no letter arrived,” he says. “I called the hospital in Glasgow and was told that I was meant to be there in 10 minutes. It takes five hours to get to Glasgow from Dervaig.” His biopsy was rescheduled for the following week and he was given the all-clear. Tobermory resident Angus Stewart also missed a hospital check-up because the notification was held up for two weeks in the Oban sorting office. “It said that missed appointments cost the NHS £140 which was deeply embarrassing,” he says. “I had to wait four weeks for a new date. I worry for those who have waited months for critical appointments.” According to Mull community council, 75% of the island and neighbouring Iona is affected. “Some areas are experiencing as few as two letter deliveries per week,” says council member Mark Aston. “Where annual leave is taken, with no holiday cover in place, this drops to zero.” Royal Mail tells complainants that reduced ferry services, due to winter timetables and ageing boats, have disrupted deliveries. Islanders, however, blame its management. Postal vans are unable to board crowded ferries because, insiders say, the company fails to pre-book crossings, and some vans that do make it across are too poorly maintained to cope with the island’s potholed roads. “Several of the council members have witnessed postal workers struggling with inoperable vehicles and resorting to their own cars to fulfil their rounds,” says Aston. “Local police have even stopped some Royal Mail vans for being unroadworthy.” Fraser Kennedy resigned as postman for the Dervaig round in March when his van broke down for the sixth time in eight weeks. “This was a known problem with vehicles coming over from Oban with bald tyres, broken suspension and engine warning lights,” he says. “We were continually told there was nothing else available. If you reported a fault, you’d often get a repair date weeks later and, come the day, the vehicle wouldn’t be booked on the ferry and no replacement provided. “All the roads on my route were narrow single-track, plus miles of rough, unmade roads in areas with poor or nonexistent mobile phone coverage. The only vehicle breakdown service is two hours away. “I enjoyed my job, but when one van suffered complete electrical failure, and the replacement came with bald tyres, I decided I was no longer prepared to risk my licence by driving unroadworthy vehicles, or the safety of myself or others.” According to Kennedy, the failure to book vans on the morning ferry meant the day’s post would sometimes reach the island after 2pm, and postal workers waiting on unpaid standby would be expected to work as late as 9pm to deliver it. “Although I was on a three-day contract, I worked six days a week for my last 10 weeks due to long-term absences. My pleas for help fell on deaf ears. “If I didn’t turn up, I just came in the next day to a bigger pile of work, made worse by not knowing whether I’d be starting at 9:30am or 2pm.” Jenni Minto, MSP for Argyll &amp; Bute, says that Mull has been omitted from Royal Mail’s list of postcodes with disrupted service, and that she met officials this month to discuss urgent action. “The impact this is having on my constituents is not acceptable,” she says. Royal Mail tells the Observer it is undertaking a review of its vehicles. “We are sorry to our customers who have experienced delays,” it says. “The service has recently been impacted by resourcing issues, including vacancies, sick absences, and travel disruption. “We have plans to improve the quality of service. This includes engaging with the local ferry operator. New posties have been recruited to fill vacancies and cover sick leave, with a number expected to begin working this month.” Mull residents think postal workers are being let down as badly as their customers because of management failings. “Just because we live on a picture-postcard island doesn’t mean our lives and businesses are in some way lesser than those on the mainland,” says Satchel. “We, too, get cancer and need to go to hospital, we too need new bank cards, passports, insurance documents. The local posties have all gone above and beyond to deliver our mail under exceptionally difficult circumstances, but they’re all now either leaving or off sick. It is breaking them.” • This article was amended on 22 May 2023.

The prize money of £50,000 is divided equally between author and translator. This year’s winner will be announced on 23 May and the judging panel have produced a strong shortlist with a distinctive flavour: four brightly coloured, zestful novels and two, more restrained stories on the theme of motherhood. Whale by Cheon Myeong-kwan, translated by Chi-Young Kim (Europa Editions, £14.99), is the South Korean author’s debut novel, first published in 2004. It’s an anarchic, often gruesome book – death by anvil, fire in a crowded theatre, a gangster who woos his beloved by sending her severed fingers – that succeeds through sheer charm. Central to his story is Geumbok, an ambitious young woman who dreams of building a cinema, and her daughter, Chunhui, a tall, muscular brick-maker. There’s so much going on that almost every subsection of each chapter could be a novella in itself, filled with old crones, physical grotesques and cartoonish violence. It’s not always easy to see whether the creaky descriptions of women – Geumbok’s “exceptionally wide rump”, Chunhui being “fat and unattractive, so unlike her mother” – are a satire of sexist attitudes or an enactment of them (Cheong cites Updike and Bukowski as key influences). Still, it is never, ever boring, even if the relentlessness is occasionally exhausting. Bulgarian author Georgi Gospodinov’s third novel, Time Shelter, translated by Angela Rodel (W&amp;N, £9.99), is equally ebullient and well stocked: it opens with 11 epigraphs, and feels like half-essay, half-novel, connecting cultural artefacts from The Magic Mountain to Auden’s September 1, 1939. The central figure is Gaustine, a sort of time traveller who opens a clinic devoted to periods of the past, to help people with Alzheimer’s. The idea takes off, and eventually European nations are voting to return to earlier eras (the 1980s is popular, as much for Dirty Dancing as for the Velvet Revolution). But below the antic exterior this is a serious book and a very strong contender, about “the innocent monster of the past” and how excessive devotion to it will lock us out of a more hopeful future. Standing Heavy, the first novel by Côte d’Ivoire author and journalist GauZ’, translated by Frank Wynne (MacLehose Press, £12), shares the exuberance of Whale and Time Shelter, but is tighter and leaner. Undocumented immigrants to France from Côte d’Ivoire are hired as retail security guards because “Black men are scary”. Their job consists of “paid standing”, which gives plenty of time for memories and reflections, both serious – on slavery, modern capitalism, 9/11 and African history – and frivolous, such as how English and French shoppers say “Sephora” differently. The guards must listen to 120 terrible songs on the store radio every six hours: “Truly, the shift break is one of the greatest achievements negotiated by trade unions.” Funny, provocative and eye-opening, this, by a nose, is my pick for the prize. By contrast, Catalan writer Eva Baltasar’s second novel, Boulder, translated by Julia Sanches (And Other Stories, £11.99), is largely humourless, unless you count the overwrought similes in this tale of passion between a former ship’s chef (Boulder) and her lover, Samsa. “She straddles me, breasts thrust up at the night like coastlines”; “Fucking her with a strap-on is like waking up summer and drowning it in its own swelter.” They settle in Iceland, where Samsa declares she wants a baby. Boulder reluctantly agrees, and the book turns to the struggles of imminent parenthood, both emotional (“if only you could set fire to every word that evokes an illness”) and existential: for Boulder, “motherhood is […] the mark that impedes freedom”. This was my least favourite title on the shortlist, though there’s no denying its sharp intensity. Similarly focused on the ambiguities of motherhood is French-Mexican novelist Guadalupe Nettel’s fourth novel, Still Born, translated by Rosalind Harvey (Fitzcarraldo Editions, £12.99). Mexican Laura is not just non-maternal (“I turned up at my gynaecologist’s office […] and asked him to tie my tubes”) but anti-maternal: she feels “crushed” when her best friend, Alina, wants to get pregnant. “From now on there would be an invisible rift between us.” Alina’s baby fails to develop in the womb (“she would be a lump if she lived”, offers one doctor, brutally), and the book opens up aspects of motherhood, as Alina struggles with her decision and Laura takes an interest in a neighbour’s child. The result can be dramatic and moving, though the muted palette of its prose makes it feel pale next to some of the vibrant storytelling elsewhere on the shortlist. Maryse Condé, who was born in Guadeloupe and writes in French, is the oldest author ever to be shortlisted for the prize, and has said that The Gospel According to the New World, translated by Richard Philcox (World Editions, £13.99), will be her final novel. If so, she’s going out with characteristic energy and style. Central to the story, set in Martinique, is adopted orphan Pascal, a beautiful daydreamer who is believed to be a new saviour: “Our Father perhaps had two sons.” The story offers winking parallels to Jesus’s life – sick boy Lazare, a friend named Judas – while pursuing threads on inequality and colonial history. “My country is small,” Pascal says. “Some will tell you that nothing much happens there.” On the contrary, if the novel has a fault it’s that too much happens too quickly, but it’s highly entertaining. • To explore all the books on the shortlist for the International Booker prize 2023, visit guardianbookshop.com.

At other times she speaks of her childhood in Tangier, or the family home in Brussels where she saw her children grow up. As Aïcha’s mind wanders, Saïdi’s documentary transforms into a haven for her memories, which are fading fast. This cinematic nest is built from old home videos and photographs, which tell of a turbulent immigrant life in Belgium. Saïdi’s older sister Amina was forced into marriage at the age of 15, and her brothers Jamal and Mohamed both died relatively young. Told through Saïdi’s sombre voiceover, these tragic events also incur questions for Aïcha, who is urged for confirmation as well as further details. While open in their intention, these conversations take on a slightly uncomfortable tone, as Aïcha becomes increasingly frustrated with her inability to recall her own past. While Saïdi had earlier received permission from her mother to film her, Aïcha’s deteriorating awareness raises the issue of whether she can meaningfully consent to having her most vulnerable moments shown on screen. With this in mind, some of Saïdi’s stylistic choices also feel quite uneasy. When juxtaposed with polished closeups of Saïdi speaking her parts of the recorded conversations, we only see Aïcha in time-stop frames; it is jarring to never see her actually speaking the words that float through the film.

Surely there are few characters who embody the spirit of that genre less than Tom Hanks’s slow-witted sprinter? But Dante Ross is thrilled with the title. “Gump is the connector,” he explains on a Zoom call from his home in Los Angeles. “He’s connected to all these things. But you don’t really know who he is.” This sobriquet, given to Ross by Black Thought, lead rapper of the Roots, is one of many endorsements that grace the cover of Ross’s new memoir, Son of the City, which details his career as one of the most successful industry executives of 90s hip-hop. The roster of rap royalty that fill the rest of the cover is a testament to Ross’s status: from Chuck D and Mike D to Questlove and Queen Latifah. Like Gump, Ross charted his ascent from inauspicious beginnings. As a white kid growing up on the pre-gentrified streets of New York, he seemed an unlikely candidate to help usher in the golden age of hip-hop. But when Run-DMC hit the scene in 1983 he was immediately captivated. He made the switch from punk to hip-hop and began hanging out in rap-friendly clubs, where he made connections that opened doors into the industry. “I don’t think I ever went out with an agenda and hung out with people who would help me ascend the ladder,” says Ross. “But I had aspirations to work in the music business, for sure.” Ross started at the bottom when a friend got him a delivery job at Rush Productions, an affiliate of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin’s Def Jam. Soon after, he was scouted as an A&amp;R executive for Tommy Boy Records. His tenure got off to a propitious start with his first assignment – supervising production for De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising. The album became an instant classic, with Ross referenced on a couple of tracks as “Dante the Scrub”. The first act Ross signed was a teenage Queen Latifah. “My first impression of her was she was a complete superstar,” he recalls. “She walked in the room with a million-dollar smile. When we heard the demos, they jumped out of the speakers.” (Her debut album, recorded under Ross’s tenure, was recently selected for preservation in the Library of Congress.) Despite this strong start, it was Ross’s five-year stint at Elektra Records that defined his career. In his memoir, Ross describes this time, perhaps immodestly, as “one of the most incredible runs of any A&amp;R person I have ever known”. Albums by Ross’s acts during that period include Brand Nubian’s One for All, Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s Return to the 36 Chambers and Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth’s Mecca and the Soul Brother – all listed on Rolling Stone’s 200 greatest hip-hop albums of all time. Still, says Ross: “There was a lot of idiot savant going on. We didn’t know what the fuck we were doing.” During his Elektra run, Ross also discovered several future stars. By signing Leaders of the New School, he launched the career of Busta Rhymes, who was so young he had to bring his mother along to sign the contract. And, by signing KMD, he introduced the world to the late MF Doom, an artist whose reputation as “the rapper’s rapper” seems to grow stronger with each passing year. Along the way, Ross also enjoyed the wild lifestyle that came with working in the music industry. He smoked a joint on Warner’s jet to see James Brown after he was released from prison. He dated a string of minor celebrities. At certain points the lifestyle seemed to get the better of him. “I drank like a fish, smoked Cypress Hill-levels of pot, and got into fights constantly,” Ross writes. One of these fights culminated in Ross trading punches with P Diddy in a nightclub. A week later, Ross bumped into Diddy again in the Armani store. “Thank God we had made peace or I might have been wearing that suit at my own funeral,” he writes. In the latter half of the 90s, Ross made a rare transition. “A lot of producers become A&amp;R guys,” he says. “But not a lot of A&amp;R guys become producers.” His move to the other side of the desk brought new levels of commercial success. With Everlast, lead rapper for House of Pain, he crafted a radio-friendly hybrid of soft rock and hip-hop that spawned the double-platinum album Whitey Ford Sings the Blues and inspired thousands of imitators. New opportunities opened, including a Grammy-winning collaboration on Santana’s all-star Supernatural album, and two production credits on Eminem’s 8 Mile soundtrack. “It was a lot of fun for a solid five years,” Ross says. “And then it wasn’t fun any more.” Ross has returned to A&amp;R work in the decades since, but he admits that his enjoyment has diminished. “No one’s signing an artist because they heard their song on an underground mix or saw a group live or were in a club and heard their record,” he says. “It doesn’t really work like that anymore.” Instead, artists are increasingly signed based on streaming figures and social media engagement. He admits to being just as guilty of it. “I can’t tell you I was proud of everything I signed,” he says of his recent A&amp;R work. “They will not be part of my legacy.” In the book, he writes about signing rapper Ugly God to Asylum Records. “I don’t think Ugly God’s talented. I think he had a hit record. But it’s not the same level of art to me,” he says, making a negative comparison with De La Soul, whom he considers “one of the greatest groups who ever made music”. Ross suggests that this is part of a broader decline within hip-hop. “When sampling became too cost-prohibitive, hip-hop lost some of its funk and soul,” he writes. And he is even less complimentary about the lyrics. “Instead of rapping about Breonna Taylor or George Floyd, we are subjected to verse after verse about pussy, lean, and materialistic bullshit,” he writes, criticising a decreased political awareness he perceives among today’s rappers. When I point out that old-school hip-hop had its share of “materialistic bullshit”, Ross pushes back. “There was always a materialistic thing, but it was also kind of fun,” he says, citing Busy Bee’s 1982 single Making Cash Money. “It evolved into something that is very, very different. It’s levelled up to a grandiose and often unrealistic scale of abject materialism that did not exist at the core of the foundational aspects of hip-hop.” Either way, Ross is correct in noting that the music has changed – as all genres do. So maybe he doesn’t align so neatly with Forrest Gump, a character who seems oblivious to the changing world around him. Perhaps he is better suited to another nickname from the cover of his book – this one from Chuck D, who calls him “the Ralph Bass of hip-hop”. The surface parallels between Ross and Bass are obvious: “Ralph Bass was a white guy who worked on Black music,” Ross says. But the similarity runs deeper. Bass started out in the 1940s, specialising in R&amp;B and working with artists including Etta James, Sam Cooke and James Brown. By the end of his career in the 90s, R&amp;B had also changed beyond recognition. Ross acknowledges the cyclical nature of change. “It’s perpetual in hip-hop,” he says. “There’s always the youth replacing the prior iteration.” And he still finds much to be inspired by in indie hip-hop: he recently started a new A&amp;R job at Plus One Records, a smaller label with an ethos more aligned to his own. “I feel like there is a lot of art in music still to be found.” • Son of the City is published by Rare Bird Books on 23 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/22/the-second-woman-review-ruth-wilsons-spellbinding-theatrical-marathon","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T07:28:15Z","webTitle":"The Second Woman review – Ruth Wilson’s spellbinding theatrical marathon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/22/the-second-woman-review-ruth-wilsons-spellbinding-theatrical-marathon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/22/the-second-woman-review-ruth-wilsons-spellbinding-theatrical-marathon","fields":{"headline":"The Second Woman review – Ruth Wilson’s spellbinding theatrical marathon","bodyText":"Even before Ruth Wilson stepped on to the stage, this extraordinary 24-hour production had confirmed itself as “event theatre”. Audiences queued outside the Young Vic, sometimes for hours, hoping to catch the European premiere of Nat Randall and Anna Breckon’s 2017 experimental play, a co-production with London international festival of theatre, in which the same scene is repeated 100 times between Wilson and a different partner. Wilson plays Virginia, who is splitting up with her lover, Marty, who comes in with a Chinese takeaway. They have an awkward exchange and a boogie before she sends him packing. The pair interact in a glass box, filmed by camera operators and projected on to a screen. The audience, which comes and goes throughout, is encouraged to switch seats in order to see this couple from different perspectives. Of the 100 participants who play Marty, most are not trained actors but there are surprise appearances from high-wattage celebrities including Ben Whishaw, Idris Elba, Andrew Scott, Toby Jones and Sope Dirisu. They are received with whoops from the audience and glints of recognition, and mischief, from Wilson. There are some industry notables too such as writer Jack Thorne and film-maker Edgar Wright. Not all are men. Anna Richardson brings one of the most inspired scenarios by playing an accusing sister, turning the scenario into a dysfunctional family drama. While Wilson has scripted lines, the others are free to improvise, which leaves her potentially vulnerable, both as performer and character. She responds quickly, and dynamically, to elaborate backstories that cast her as mother, older lover, even prime minister. There are, increasingly, knowing references to tiredness, to which she keeps a straight face. The knowledge that there have been no rehearsals with her partners brings a frisson of excitement, and we wonder how far they will go to catch her out. After the first two hours, Wilson has grown bolder with the format and it is Virginia who seems the more dangerous, unpredictable party. She introduces long silences, glaring or responding to the most overbearing men with counter-assertions of control. A hug becomes an act of violence, a dance a wrestling match, but some exits are filled with sudden tenderness too. There are holes in the narrative from which questions gradually emerge. What has happened to this couple? How is Virginia the second woman? Who has committed infidelity? And who is being exploited? Not all of them are answered but they never lose their intrigue. Inspired by a scene in John Cassavetes’s 1977 film Opening Night, which features an actress who feels a waning sense of her power, the play explores gender norms and power dynamics. The scene buzzes with the final, betraying emotions of a breakup. A few men lunge in for a kiss and she deflects this effectively with exaggerated contortions. Some – mostly younger men – tell her she is scary or gibber nervously. Others build an emotional earnestness or intensity so when they tell Wilson they will always love her, even as she dismisses them, it feels like a small, self-contained tragedy. The audience, early on, begins to laugh – with nervousness, it seems – and Wilson amps up the weird, dark absurdism in the dance which becomes a feat of physical comedy as time goes on. Wilson’s character lollops in the men’s arms, sometimes dragged around them like a rag doll or automaton, variously floppy or stiff, and at other times her movements are charged with comic ferocity and dominatrix energy. Lovers’ strokes turn into maulings, of sorts. Wilson’s stamina is astonishing to witness as the hours roll by – and as the waves of tiredness descend on me. Even as an inveterate insomniac, I began to feel clumsy and weak. This is a production that cannot be judged purely on what happens on stage. There is the drama of the audience as well – its turnover through the night, how the collective response changes. Part of the experience feels like it is about congregation itself. There is, at the start, the intense camaraderie of a shared experience, with one neighbour turning to talk to another. Despite my tiredness, which turns to desperation as I hit my first wall at 2am, I am never bored by the same replaying scene or the song, Taste of Love, by Aura, which repeats 100 times too and has a muzak sound. I am transfixed not only by Wilson but by the interaction itself, same yet different every time, and always magnetically unpredictable. I have expected for the crowds to ebb away in the early hours and have brought my travel pillow and a small blanket, to stretch myself out at around 4am. But to my surprise, and then alarm, there is never an empty seat next to me. It becomes evident that the auditorium will stay jam-packed. The piano music, in between scenes, composed by Nina Buchanan, offers comforting interludes. The only frustration is the acoustics – the sound is faint, almost mute, in some parts of the room. In the last eight hours, I am wet with sweat and feel horribly dehydrated: in the short breaks we are given away from our seats, I have prioritised eating, drinking coffee, and the toilet queue. (Wilson herself has 15 minutes off every two hours.) Twenty hours in, I am feeling the toll. But I am also entirely captured by what is happening and feel a sense of exaltation in the final hours. The experience of time changes throughout the show. Some hours feel long, others like minutes. As soon as the morning crowd starts filing in, I feel their sense of freshness. The queue, meanwhile, just keeps on building, trending on Twitter and snaking not just outside the building but also coiled within it. And the audience keeps cheering Wilson on, clapping after every scene, stamping their feet. Wilson kept in character throughout, only looking out towards us – through tears – for a lengthy standing ovation at the end. What hard earned tears, and adulation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/michelle-rowland-warns-status-quo-isnt-good-enough-on-gambling-advertising","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T07:21:29Z","webTitle":"Michelle Rowland warns ‘status quo isn’t good enough’ on gambling advertising","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/michelle-rowland-warns-status-quo-isnt-good-enough-on-gambling-advertising","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/michelle-rowland-warns-status-quo-isnt-good-enough-on-gambling-advertising","fields":{"headline":"Michelle Rowland warns ‘status quo isn’t good enough’ on gambling advertising","bodyText":"The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has warned the “status quo isn’t good enough” on gambling advertising as the independent Zoe Daniel and some Labor MPs push for a ban on the ads. Daniel introduced to parliament on Monday a private member’s bill that would place an outright ban on gambling ads on radio, broadcast television, pay TV and their respective streaming services. The independent MP told the lower house that it was “all very well” for the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to say they’ve had enough, but it was time to “do something”. The Labor MP Mike Freelander endorsed Daniel’s bill over the more limited proposal by Dutton to ban ads during sports matches and an hour either side of them. Freelander told Guardian Australia that his view is gambling ads are “insidious and malignant” because they are “aimed at young adults and our kids”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup “I don’t think we should be having them on our screens or on our radio. It’s a dangerous industry that has led to a lot of misery. “The gambling industry has a lot to answer for – when it comes to regulating the ads, the stricter the better, as far as I’m concerned.” Albanese has expressed a personal dislike for gambling advertising but the government says it is waiting for a parliamentary inquiry into online gambling and the effect of advertising on children before introducing its own reform. Freelander defended the government’s pace of reform, insisting that Rowland “is determined to do it, but wants to get it right”. Graham Perrett, the Labor member for Moreton, said he “shares” Daniel’s concern but added that “good legislation takes time”. “I watch a lot of sport and I’ve seen a lot of gambling ads. I’ve got two kids,” Perrett said. “When gambling is more pervasive than the sport itself, it’s not a safe environment for families as it should be.” Rowland said there was “serious concern about gambling ads across the community and it’s obvious the status quo isn’t good enough”. “We want to ensure our approach to reform is comprehensive and evidence-based, and examines the multiple channels over which advertising is delivered including broadcast, social media and branding,” she told Guardian Australia. “Labor – both in opposition and in government – has a strong record on minimising harms associated with online gambling. “I’m pleased that members of the crossbench are willing to work with the government to reduce gambling harm, including in relation to gambling advertising.” The Labor member for Chisholm, Carina Garland, said her constituents tell her that “gambling generally and gambling advertising are more and more accessible to younger people”. Garland expressed confidence in Rowland’s approach, which she said would aim to minimise harm and achieve “harmonisation” across platforms. In February Rowland came under fire for accepting donations from gaming company Sportsbet before the 2022 election, although she insisted no rules were breached by doing so and the donations did not influence Labor’s “strong” position. Television broadcasters have warned an ad ban could be expensive and imperil free sport on TV, but the idea is popular among voters. Daniel’s bill was supported at a press conference by fellow independents Kate Chaney, Zali Steggall, Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender. Daniel told the House of Representatives that the gambling industry will resist broadcast changes because “like big tobacco” they are “making millions off the young, the poor and the desperate in our communities”. “But with gambling ads at saturation levels and invading the minds of our young people in ever more insidious ways, to the extent that multis are now of more interest than the games themselves, we must act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2023/may/22/luton-kenilworth-road-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"Luton’s Kenilworth Road is crumbling but deserves a Premier League chance | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/luton-kenilworth-road-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/luton-kenilworth-road-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Luton’s Kenilworth Road is crumbling but deserves a Premier League chance","bodyText":"Shortly before 8pm last Tuesday, a remarkable act of transfiguration took place at Kenilworth Road. At that precise moment, Luton’s cramped and crumbling old stadium, with a capacity barely above 10,000, became a raging, roaring, hot-headed monster. The noise barely stopped for the next 90 minutes, at which point Luton’s players had seen off Sunderland and were heading to a playoff final at Wembley – and the jokes and sneers about their old ground had resurfaced again on social media. Does Kenilworth Road deserve to grace the Premier League? If Luton can get past Coventry on Saturday, the only answer is a punchy and unqualified yes. Sure it is no looker. Unlike Craven Cottage, also built in 1905, it will never attract the love of the blue plaque heritage brigade. The wooden main stand is so tight in places that you have to duck your head when you go to the toilet, while the away fans’ entrance in the Oak Road End looks down on residents’ gardens. Yet give me it over any soulless, out-of-town ground any day. Now Luton face their biggest sliding doors moment since being relegated on the eve of the Premier League in 1992. This, however, isn’t just a story of Luton Town but of Luton the town, too. For decades it has been a put‑down, a punchbag, a punchline to an easy joke. It is a perennial visitor to books like Crap Towns II and lists of the most awful places in the country. As someone who was born and raised in Luton, I know it has plenty of rough edges. But scratch a little deeper, amid its struggles and chronic lack of investment, and you find hope that Saturday could really transform the town as well as the club. It boils down to football economics 101. Promotion to the Premier League remains the most valuable prize in the world game, the sporting equivalent of hitting the Euromillions jackpot, with around £170m on offer in broadcast revenue and parachute payments even if Luton go down after one season. Most of it would be spent on a new £100m stadium, slap-bang in the middle of the town centre. There is talk of an economic boost, regeneration, renewed optimism. There is something else worth stating here. We hear a lot of gushing pronouncements about how much football clubs mean to their communities, especially in times of success or peril. Mostly, though, we are just guessing. But in Luton’s case we actually know. That’s because in 2009, the year the club tumbled out of the Football League, academics found that 47% of Luton residents believed their quality of life would be reduced if professional football in the town ceased. That is a remarkably high figure given many people do not care that much for sport. What’s more, the academics found that 53.5% of respondents to a survey also said they would pay more in council tax to keep the club from going bust. “This tells you the community has a stake in the club too,” one of the report’s authors, David Forrest, told me. “It doesn’t just belong to the owners or the fans. It belongs to the town.” What makes Luton’s story even more remarkable is that they often had to take the accountancy equivalent of smelling salts as they tumbled down the divisions. During their worst period of financial peril and strife they went into administration three times, had 40 points’ worth of deductions, and endured four relegations. Yet they have endured. It helps, of course, that they are no longer a vessel for dreamers or mad-eyed schemers. Some fans still shudder at the mention of the former chairman John Gurney, who talked of building a 50,000-seat ground with a “Teflon roof kept up by air pressure” to host Formula One and NFL matches at the same time the club were crashing into administration. He also launched a “manager idol” telephone vote among fans, at 50p a pop, during his disastrous 55-day reign. Before him there was David Kohler, who dreamed of a 20,000-capacity “Kohlerdome” by the M1 with a pitch placed on a hovercraft that would have been moved in and out of the stadium on match days, while Luton’s chairman in their glory days, David Evans, even called for cat-o’-nine-tails used on hooligans. True, every club has its stories of misfortune and woe. But Luton’s have been so ridiculously farcical they could have been penned by Groucho Marx. It was Evans who banned away supporters in the aftermath of Millwall fans tearing up the stadium in 1985. For decades that was the source of much of the antipathy towards Luton but, in a surprisingly sympathetic Guardian column at the time, David Lacey backed the club. As he pointed out, they were “trying to recreate an age” where it was safe to watch football – and fans could “wear their colours without fear of being abused or attacked, and if they were visiting supporters they were not marched to the ground by the police like prisoners-of-war”. Times have changed. Attitudes towards Luton, too. But more than 35 years later, one thing has remained resolutely unchanged. As Simon Inglis put it in his 1987 edition of The Football Grounds of Great Britain: “Until you have been to Kenilworth Road you cannot appreciate how cramped is ‘cramped’.” That much is true. As, hopefully, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and the rest of the Premier League’s biggest stars will soon find out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/creating-the-kate-middleton-blowout-using-heated-rollers","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"Creating the Kate Middleton ‘blowout’ using heated rollers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/creating-the-kate-middleton-blowout-using-heated-rollers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/creating-the-kate-middleton-blowout-using-heated-rollers","fields":{"headline":"Creating the Kate Middleton ‘blowout’ using heated rollers","bodyText":"The hack Creating a fast, bouncy, blow-dry effect with heated rollers. The test Heated rollers have fallen out of fashion, and perhaps with good reason. It’s hard to find a good set – they’re fiddly to use, and with newer developments (see the Dyson Airwrap) and heatless hacks (see the bathroom belt or sock methods) we have other choices now. However, this method, coined by TikToker Shauna Rafferty, uses heated rollers a little differently. Instead of starting with your hair down, then rolling each section and pinning it to your head, you put your hair in a high ponytail then divide the tail into sections, using a hot roller for each, and finish by pinning them to the crown. When they’re cooled, Shauna undoes the ponytail to reveal Kate Middleton-esque curled ends that look like a professional blow-dry. So I did exactly this, but having curly hair I also needed to blow dry it straight first. After following the method, my ends were indeed bouncy as I did the big reveal, but I could also get this look quicker using tongs. The verdict If you like this style, have straight, thick-ish hair and heated rollers to hand, then give it a go. A bigger issue for me and my fine non-caucasian hair is that this Sloaney bouncy blow-dry look was difficult enough to achieve first time round as a 00s trend. So if it’s having a revival via TikTok, then I just have zero desire to try to fit that mould again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/climate-emergency-silent-red-rebel-brigade","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"Why I stopped arguing about the climate emergency and tried the silent treatment instead | Helena Echlin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/climate-emergency-silent-red-rebel-brigade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/climate-emergency-silent-red-rebel-brigade","fields":{"headline":"Why I stopped arguing about the climate emergency and tried the silent treatment instead","bodyText":"My clown-white facepaint makes my skin feel tight and I’m scared my elaborate headdress is going to slip. It’s my first outing with the Red Rebel Brigade, the silent climate activist performance group. About a dozen of us are clad in robes, veils and evening gloves – all a bright blood-red. We glide to our local Barclays bank to stand in a tableau of grief. We are meant to aim for the faraway stare of “a watcher through the ages”, but I’m afraid I look more like someone stuck in a slow queue at Sainsbury’s. I suddenly catch the eye of someone I know as they walk past, staring at me like I’m bonkers. But I’ve tried the sensible ways of doing something about the climate crisis. I’ve written letters to politicians, carried placards and had endless conversations. At best, I just put people’s backs up. So I’ve decided to shut up and wrap myself in a red sheet instead. Two years before this, on the morning of 9 September 2020, I woke in my home in Berkeley, California, to a Plutonian twilight. Smoke from the latest wildfire had mixed with the fog in a blanket that shorter wavelengths of light couldn’t penetrate. I tried to explain away the darkness to my kids but I felt like a parent in biblical Egypt, claiming everything was fine while frogs rained from the sky. My husband and I had worried about California’s escalating drought and wildfires for years, but after Orange Skies Day we decided we’d had enough. Time to move back to my native UK. (Unlike millions displaced by the climate crisis, we were privileged to have this option.) Once we got here, people wondered why on earth we’d leave sunny California. I told the truth: “Because of the climate apocalypse.” After politely ascertaining that wildfires hadn’t actually burned our house down, people couldn’t change the topic fast enough. But I didn’t take the hint. Since nearly everything we do has a carbon cost, every conversation led to the climate crisis. When my parents posted pictures of themselves basking in the Spanish heatwave on the family WhatsApp chat, I responded: “The world’s getting hotter fast. Who wants to join me at the next climate protest?” Awkward silence ensued. In his book Don’t Even Think About It, about why we ignore climate breakdown, George Marshall says that when he brings it up “the words collapse, sink and die in mid-air, and the conversation suddenly changes course. It is like an invisible force field.” Yep. I joined my local Extinction Rebellion group and they told me the best way to start conversations about climate was not to talk, but to listen. After that, instead of telling people how worried I was, I asked if they were worried. “Yes, but I recycle,” said a neighbour at a picnic. “Can I have your tart recipe?” That night, while doom-scrolling, I saw a picture of the Red Rebels and felt an instant connection: here were people who didn’t downplay their climate grief for the sake of others. They flaunted it. At last, here was an outlet for my climate emotions. At my first outing as a Red, I expect to feel anxious and exposed, but it’s unexpectedly restorative. I can’t answer texts during our performances, and my kids can’t ask me for snacks. Passersby follow us and even want to strike up conversations. But I just raise my hands as if holding an invisible chalice, my go-to pose. I’m blissfully silent. It’s relaxing to be the one exerting the invisible force field. A week later, at a barbecue, something amazing happens: I don’t feel the urge to tell everyone about plant-based burgers, but just enjoy myself instead. And when I go to see my sister’s new kitchen extension I don’t ask about its carbon footprint, but admire her stylish skylights. I no longer feel the need to rant about the climate in daily interaction. I’m less angry with other people because I’m less angry with myself. I feel as if I’m doing something useful. But in April, I have a moment of doubt. I join more than 70 Reds as part of Extinction Rebellion’s protest weekend in London, and afterwards, looking at all the photos, I ask myself: is this just about looking amazing? But then I remember the wonder on onlookers’ faces. Some cry. Some call us “spawn of Satan” or shout about “climate conspiracy”, but we always inspire big emotions. I hope the emotion that people tap into will drive them to act. Other forms of activism are valuable, but as a Red, I can see the effect I’m having on people’s faces.

I first met him in 1969, in Paris, when we both found ourselves staying in the same apartment on the Île Saint-Louis for a few days. I was 17, Martin was 20. I only realised who this Martin guy was four years later when his first novel, The Rachel Papers, appeared. In a strange but real sense, he was the first writer I had ever met. And thus began an acquaintance as an avid reader and later as a friend. The remarkable thing about that first novel was the utter confidence and distinctiveness of the narrative voice. Martin found his style at the very beginning of his career as a writer and it never changed. That voice he had defined and charged everything else he wrote – fiction, essays, journalism, memoirs. Very few writers can be instantly identified by a sentence or two of their prose – Laurence Sterne, Charles Dickens, James Joyce, DH Lawrence, Vladimir Nabokov – and Martin precociously joined that elite group and stayed there. His style became his unmistakable signature. And there was also the wit and humour. He identified himself as a comic writer – however serious his subject matter. He saw the world and its cruel absurdities through a comic lens. He was a very, very funny writer as well as a ferociously intelligent one and that should never be forgotten. Because of the wonderful energies and original allure of his writing style, Martin became, over the decades that followed his first novel, a kind of exemplar of the contemporary British novelist, though he was not necessarily happy in that role. Having Kingsley Amis as his father also contributed: Martin was the one easiest to point to; the one easiest to place on a pedestal. And with good reason, in fact, because Martin was inimitable as a writer – though many people tried to imitate him, of course. That is his great legacy to literature and our great loss."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","bodyText":"1) Guardiola’s mind turns to differing finals It barely mattered what happened on the pitch on Sunday, but another league win for City, their 12th in a row, maintained another ludicrous title-snaffling run. Now, though, Pep Guardiola needs to plot tactics for two very different finals – in the FA Cup against Manchester United, the local rivals whose treble they’re trying to emulate, and in the Champions League against Internazionale, who won’t leave them the kind of spaces Real Madrid did – while keeping his players fresh but in rhythm. This is not an exact science, as different personalities and different body types need different conditions to keep ticking along at their maximum – and the fear of missing out on history through injury will surely be present in the minds of some. So with Premier League games at Brighton and Brentford to come, expect to see those players who’ve not been starting regularly, with cameo appearances for regulars. Don’t be surprised if they then start slowly in either final … and be even less surprised if they blow away both opponents early. Daniel Harris Match report: Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea 2) Cooper can begin to build at Forest There’s a theory – an entirely reasonable one given how Nottingham Forest’s results have gone in waves this season – that the seven signings made in January destabilised the squad. Perhaps survival would have been secured a few weeks ago had it not been for that disruption to a squad only just getting to know each other after being bought en masse in the summer. But a number of the players who arrived in January have played key roles in keeping Forest up. Danilo, bought from Palmeiras for £17.4m, has added directness on the right. Felipe, brought in from Atlético Madrid for £2m, has been an authoritative presence at the back. Keylor Navas, on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, has been inspirational. Somehow Steve Cooper has fostered a team spirit within a disparate group. If there is any logic to football, he may be able to forge something even better with a more measured approach in the market this summer. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Nottingham Forest 1-0 Arsenal 3) Villa thrive on Emery attention to detail There will be “hours and hours” of Brighton analysis for Aston Villa’s players this week, according to John McGinn, and no complaints. Having risen from 14th place, three points above the relegation zone in October, to within one win of qualifying for Europe on the final day under Unai Emery, faith in the manager’s methods is absolute. “We will have plenty of meetings, plenty of detail, but if you ask any player who has worked with him this year he has been an absolute pleasure,” said McGinn. “He’s made myself better, he’s made other players better.” That was again evident at Anfield where, considering Liverpool’s recent form and the stakes for Jürgen Klopp’s side, Villa earned an impressive point. A place in the Europa Conference League will be on the line at Villa Park on Sunday. “Players will want to sign and will want to improve under him, players will see where the club is going,” McGinn added. “It’s a passionate club, a kind of sleeping giant and hopefully next week we can start to waken up a wee bit.” Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 1-1 Aston Villa 4) Frank’s four reflects poorly on Spurs Brentford’s victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was hardly a surprise – they have beaten Manchester City and Chelsea this season, and drawn against Arsenal (when they were good), all away from home. In all of those games (plus fixtures against Manchester United, Newcastle and Liverpool) Thomas Frank started with a back three, for extra defensive security. Meanwhile against the division’s less fearsome teams, especially at home, he prefers a back four. It was a reflection of Spurs’ current standing that here he started with four defenders, and maintained that shape until Tottenham started flinging on extra forwards. “I felt we had an opportunity to go with a shape that gave us the best possibility to win the game,” Frank explained. Perhaps Brentford’s team selection could be summarised thus: “Lads, it’s Tottenham.” Simon Burnton Match report: Tottenham 1-3 Brentford 5) Plenty more to come from Paquetá Lucas Paquetá is a lot of fun when he is in the mood. The Brazilian took a while to settle after joining West Ham from Lyon last summer and there is still a sense of more to come from him. David Moyes wants more end product from Paquetá, who has scored only five goals in all competitions this season. Yet he is is a delight to watch when he purrs. His technique is wonderfully pure and he has a lovely way of gliding past opponents. Take the moment when he dribbled beyond Leeds’s Rasmus Kristensen and set up Manuel Lanzini’s goal as West Ham eased to a 3-1 win over Sam Allardyce’s side. The control was beautiful from Paquetá, as was the imagination. It seemed he had no room but his footwork was too good for his opponent. West Ham will hope Paquetá is just as inspired against Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. Jacob Steinberg Match report: West Ham 3-1 Leeds 6) City highlight Chelsea’s wasted wealth Watching Manchester City mark their latest title win with a seemingly scripted victory against Chelsea was to take in two visions of extreme wealth. In the sky blue corner: hard-edged ruthlessness, machine-like efficiency, a sort of cold, AI-generated beauty with an underlying hint of cruelty. In the royal blue corner: spectacular excess, grotesque waste, and a chastening reminder of what it means to have more money than sense. Pep Guardiola’s process is so refined that he could afford to field an unfamiliar lineup featuring five players aged 23 or under, and give a first league start to Kalvin Phillips, without ceding much control. Frank Lampard, meanwhile, brought on five substitutes, signed for a combined £227m, without ever really indicating what he hoped to achieve. Where City have made the most of their vast resources, Chelsea have done the exact opposite, and it is hard to imagine such an incoherent team challenging the champions any time soon. Will Magee 7) Dyche seeks to dial down noise Three years ago Bournemouth were relegated at Goodison Park on the final day of the season. Everton hope to avoid the same fate when the teams meet on Merseyside on Sunday. After rescuing a draw at Wolves, Sean Dyche repeatedly alluded to the off-field noise that stalks his team and he knows the importance of shutting it out if they are to avoid dropping into the second tier for the first time since 1951. But pressing mute is easier said than done. “It is not very easy nowadays because there’s media everywhere,” Dyche said. “Everyone’s a journo now. Everyone with their phone, everyone who wanders around the Trafford Centre. You can’t control all the opinion out there. We can change it and mould it by winning and playing well, but when we get out on the pitch that’s the freedom for us.” Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 1-1 Everton 8) Ferguson shows a touch of Haaland Sometimes it’s good to laugh, and the procession of quality that has emerged at Brighton this season is so ridiculous, it’s funny. There is something about Evan Ferguson that makes you think he could be the best of the bunch. His two goals against Saints were not just expertly taken but without a hint of hesitation. His build is outrageous, his power intense, his technique on point and his attitude, judging by the fierce growl he gave his teammates after scoring his second, seems spot-on, too. Not quite as fleet of foot as Erling Haaland, Ferguson has many of the Norwegian’s other attributes, and some years yet to develop his game to the level of the current destroyer of leagues. The young Irishman might not make it, of course, and there would be no shame in that. But there is enough to suggest that watching him try will be fun. Paul MacInnes Match report: Brighton 3-1 Southampton 9) Ten Hag thankful for Casemiro’s impact Any concerns Manchester United supporters may have had about finishing off the season with Champions League qualification in the bag were put to bed by Saturday’s performance in the win at Bournemouth that came thanks to Casemiro’s early goal. But as well as his instinctive acrobatic finish, it was the Brazilian who set the tone for what Erik ten Hag described as one of his side’s best performances of the season with an all-action display. The former Real Madrid man has proved that he can also provide creativity and is building a good understanding with Christian Eriksen. “Absolutely, by far,” Ten Hag said when asked if Casemiro has exceeded expectations since his arrival in August. “We needed a player in the midfield – we searched for a strategist. It was not easy because there are not that many in the profile who fit our standards. So we are happy we found him and his contribution is massive.” Ed Aarons Match report: Bournemouth 0-1 Manchester United 10) Hodgson staying on makes sense When Roy Hodgson took over at Crystal Palace, they were three points above the relegation zone with 22 goals from 28 league games and without a win in 13. Now, with one match remaining, they’re 13 above the bottom three having scored 17 in nine, of which five have been won and two drawn. So what happens next? Hodgson, the league’s oldest manager, is nearly 76 and was recruited on a short-term contract to do a particular job. On the other hand, his impact – liberating Palace’s coterie of exciting attackers – has been significant. The suggestion is that the club will extend his contract by another year – cue Hodgson’s inevitable “Sheila will be happy to have me out the house” deadpan – with his assistant, Paddy McCarthy, eventually taking over in a move that makes sense. Palace’s young stars have momentum – hard to get and easy to lose – so it would be silly to let go the man who coaxed it out of them, just because he’s old.

To this, I would add another habit: “sharing music videos from my youth to get through the weekend alone with my primary school-age child”. Both ideas feed into the plot of Petite Maman, Céline Sciamma’s beloved film in which a little girl befriends another girl of the same age in the woods behind her recently deceased grandma’s house, before discovering her playmate is actually her mother as a child. Sciamma’s film was very much on my mind one Sunday evening while watching some old music videos with my daughter, CJ. During one, we come to an artist who stops CJ in her tracks. “Her!” she says. “I love her”. She is half delirious, as I was too, the first time I saw Neneh Cherry on TV when I was around CJ’s age. So my daughter and I meet in the “woods”, which in this case, is the surrealist beach of her video for Manchild, its shoreline strung with laundry drying on a line and other things she recognises from our daily life. But instead of Neneh’s wet hair still wrapped in a turban as I go into the world, it’s mine; and instead of handing the baby to a trusted friend before bursting into her rap verse, I am sending her on a playdate when I’m trying to meet a deadline. In the video, Neneh is maternal and caring but needs, momentarily, to let go when it’s time for her most demanding vocals. Styled by the punk iconoclast, Judy Blame, I could write a thesison the impact of Neneh’s style. The heavy gold earrings. The Lycra cycling shorts, the high top sneakers. An Earth Mother who could feel the ground beneath her and a Goddess who would take you higher. At a pivotal age, she became my template of how to be a grown woman in domestic life. My daughter replays the moment when the baby is handed to the friend (in the video it’s the artist Barry Kamen, who features alongside Neneh’s real best friend, chef Andi Oliver) several times. It thrills her to think the baby might be the pop star Mabel, who is Neneh’s youngest daughter in real life – though it’s not true. The baby is actually her middle daughter Tyson. Her eldest, Naima, is on a swing in the right corner of the screen. But CJ likes her version, and sticks with it. Neneh Cherry was born in Stockholm but her parents moved to New York (living in the same loft building as Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads). Her stepfather, the jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, took her along when he toured with the Slits. Punk and new wave shaped her as much as hip-hop (and it may be that mashing of genres that meant she was never embraced in the label-obsessed US the way she was in Europe). Transfixed by the Slits’ front woman Ari Up, and then by Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex, she dropped out of school at 14 and headed to London. Buffalo Stance, the first single from her seminal debut album Raw Like Sushi, came out in 1988, and she famously danced in Lycra to it while seven months pregnant on Top of the Pops. It is an image seared into so many women’s memories – as it was for the Swedish pop genius, Robyn, who covered it for The Versions. When you consider that Cherry has also duetted with Youssou N’Dour and Michael Stipe, I think there should be a word like “schadenfreude” for when people you hold in high esteem respect you back. We watch a few more Neneh Cherry videos. Then, emboldened, I put on Deee-Lite. Lady Miss Kier was also huge for me around that time, but when I show her Groove Is in the Heart, CJ finds it very frightening – the mania, Q-Tip’s disembodied head floating in space. The same had happened when I switched her from Audrey Hepburn – she’d watched Roman Holiday and Sabrina 20 times – to Marilyn Monroe. She could feel Marilyn’s anxiety and asked me to turn it off right away. Maybe she saw the vulnerability to come with adolescence, the woman being wanted without wanting, the walls closing in. Girls look to female pop stars to understand: what kind of woman are you going to be? For Neneh Cherry in these videos everything is possible, which then extends to us. She’s beautiful, but not in a way that makes men want to hurt her. I don’t ever want my daughter to experience thoughts like this: that Neneh Cherry has cycling shorts and trainers, so if she needs to, she can run away. I’ve tried to track the brand of trainers she wears – Fila, Champion, Reebok – as if that could be key to us staying safe. Or it could be that her heavy gold jewellery becomes a self-defence weapon. But she wouldn’t need that because she can talk her way safe, to form a connection with the craziest, bleakest human. She could escape. Neneh Cherry’s whole look, her entire sound is “if a woman could run at night with headphones on and not have to be afraid”. I don’t know if she feels that way. It may be as much something to dream into for her as it is for me. Writing these columns, I’ve been trying to clarify (as they say at the end of one particular 12 Step meeting) “what has been given us, what has been taken and what has been left behind”. I wrote to Cherry when I was 12. She didn’t reply, which doesn’t matter, a good early lesson in putting prayers out to the heavens, knowing there may not be a response. Just saying: “this matters to me and here’s why” is a ritual that creates motion. I’ve carried her vibrations with me for three decades, now. My interpretation, via Cherry, of what motherhood could be was naive. But I want my daughter to see me still stretching for it, the shape I make, the muscles flexed, as I move towards something out of reach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2023/may/22/ryanair-profit-summer-bookings-aircraft","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:48:26Z","webTitle":"Ryanair rebounds to near-record profit as summer bookings soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/22/ryanair-profit-summer-bookings-aircraft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/22/ryanair-profit-summer-bookings-aircraft","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair rebounds to near-record profit as summer bookings soar","bodyText":"Ryanair has bounced back to a near-record €1.4bn (£1.2bn) profit last year and expects to better that in 2023, fuelled by a summer boom in which the low-cost airline will carry a record number of passengers. Europe’s largest airline swung back to profit in the year to the end of March after reporting a €355m loss in the previous year. The company, led by its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said it was cautiously optimistic that it would increase profits again this year, which could result in it topping the record €1.45bn it made in 2018. The company says it expects to carry 186 million people this year, backed by its largest-ever summer schedule covering almost 2,500 routes and 3,000 daily flights, with a long-term ambition to fly 300 million a year by 2034 – more than any airline has managed. The British Airways owner, IAG, recently upgraded its profit expectations thanks to strong demand for holiday travel, as consumers spend on getaways despite the cost of living squeeze. “To date, summer 2023 demand is robust and peak summer 2023 fares are trending ahead of last year,” O’Leary said. “First-quarter fares, which benefited from a strong Easter in April – and a very weak previous year comparable due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – will be significantly higher than the first quarter of 2022-23.” The airline, which earlier this month spent $40bn (£32bn) on 300 new aircraft from Boeing in a bet it can continue to outperform European rivals, carried a record 168 million passengers last year. Neil Sorahan, the Ryanair chief financial officer, said that while he expected the overall European aviation industry to still not fully recover this year, as it was running at 90% to 95% pre-Covid capacity levels, Ryanair was operating at 125% of pre-pandemic levels and growing. “We don’t have a lot of visibility into the second half of this year, as we normally would, but the first quarter and Easter has been strong and fares into the second quarter are trending well. We are hopeful,” he said. Soaring costs and increased capacity will add €1bn to Ryanair’s fuel costs this year – which Sorahan said equated to about €5 a passenger that it has to find in costs – but the company said it was “cautiously optimistic” that revenue would grow enough this year to cover that and increase profits. “Despite inflation weighing on consumer spending, European consumers are still opting for leisure travel over other forms of entertainment,” said Olly Anibaba, an analyst at Third Bridge. “The real test for Ryanair will be the off-peak periods, especially in winter. To fill up their planes, Ryanair might have to offer discounts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/afternoon-update-australian-climber-dies-on-everest-nsw-officer-guilty-of-assaulting-indigenous-boy-and-guy-pearce-returning-to-neighbours","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:44:52Z","webTitle":"Australian climber dies on Everest; NSW officer guilty of assaulting Indigenous boy; and Guy Pearce returning to Neighbours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/afternoon-update-australian-climber-dies-on-everest-nsw-officer-guilty-of-assaulting-indigenous-boy-and-guy-pearce-returning-to-neighbours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/afternoon-update-australian-climber-dies-on-everest-nsw-officer-guilty-of-assaulting-indigenous-boy-and-guy-pearce-returning-to-neighbours","fields":{"headline":"Australian climber dies on Everest; NSW officer guilty of assaulting Indigenous boy; and Guy Pearce returning to Neighbours","bodyText":"Good afternoon.

Queensland is one of the last Australian jurisdictions that prevents a person charged with serious sexual offences from being named until they are committed to stand trial. Guardian Australia has learned new laws being introduced to change this would be retrospective, meaning accused rapists could be named as soon as the laws come into effect if they continue to face charges. Committal proceedings for the high-profile man, who is accused of two counts of raping a young woman in October 2021, have been before the Toowoomba magistrates court this year. A bid by a group of media companies seeking leave to name the accused man was rejected by the court in February as premature. Last week the court heard lawyers for the accused would seek access to information from his alleged victim’s phone. He remains on bail and the case will return to court on 28 June. With a bill expected to be introduced this week, Guardian Australia understands the new Queensland laws are expected to pass in August or September. They would probably take a few months to commence. The legislative change was one of 188 recommendations from the state’s Women’s Safety and Justice taskforce. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup One victim, who was still awaiting a committal hearing more than three and a half years after making a complaint, was quoted in the taskforce’s report regarding the “painful” impact of the anonymity afforded to people charged. “He can continue his life under protection of the legal system, but we cannot even be told why our committal hearing has been adjourned. The imbalance in this system is astounding.” The former attorney general Shannon Fentiman – now Queensland’s health minister after a cabinet reshuffle last week – said she was “looking forward” to the introduction of the “significant piece of legislation”. “I’m really proud of the reform from the Women’s Safety and Justice taskforce and overhauling our criminal justice system, and I will be there to see all of that implemented,” she said.

Her speech, in front of their friends and family, highlighted the accomplishments of Wright’s eclectic career. He had grown up in Chicago, she began, starting out as a radio DJ, before working as a promotion executive for the record label Epic on campaigns for Michael Jackson, Pearl Jam and Céline Dion. In 1999, he had moved on again, to Napa Valley, California, to pursue his dream of making wine. He and Martha had sold the business in 2014, with Wright turning to film-making. “And then,” Wright says, “she noted that I had a reputation for being a bit of a dick.” Martha’s words gave Wright the push he needed to “start getting serious about figuring out who the hell I was”. To this end, in March, at 68, he travelled to Mexico for his first psychedelic experience. He had read Michael Pollan’s 2018 book, How to Change Your Mind, as well as the research of Roland Griffiths, a professor in psychiatry and neuroscience, and expected “a very intimate and personal” trip. “I couldn’t imagine getting the full experience in a room full of people on their own journeys,” he says. So he booked a one-to-one retreat for “young elders”, run by Maria Camille, in San Miguel de Allende. On day one, Camille instructed Wright to compose a letter to the mushroom, “expressing my intentions and thoughts and fears”. On day two, Wright took psilocybin, the hallucinogenic chemical contained in magic mushrooms, in small squares of dark chocolate. “The next four and a half hours were the most profound, intense and mind-blowing minutes I have ever spent,” he says. “Above and beyond everything else, it’s an amazing light show. Once the rocket took off, I was holding on for dear life, but it turned out to be good … People say it’s like 20 years’ worth of therapy in a few hours, and I think that’s spot on.” He saw visions of his late mother, his late mother-in-law and his daughter. When it was over, he crawled into bed “and cried like a baby”. The experience felt like being reborn, he says: “I felt myself being squeezed through a canal. At one point, I could really feel something pressing on my body and I was being pushed through something. I have felt like a very, very different person since that experience.” In his late 50s, Wright had begun to embrace “new stuff”: running marathons, tattoos. “I have always been a bit of a seeker, getting out of my comfort zone,” he says. But Martha’s birthday toast instigated more meaningful change. “We started doing couples therapy. I committed to a meditation process.” In 2016, Wright had started making documentaries, most recently about the singer John Waite. Now, a film with Camille about the retreat is in pre-production. He has recently turned to writing, with a screenplay based on his time as a DJ. “I think this may be the last career,” he says. Does he feel he has got to the bottom of what Martha meant in her toast? “I was successful and I had big jobs, but I was actually very insecure and I always had this problem of feeling ‘less than’. As a result, I acted out and was braggadocious and negative to other people,” he says. “I was aware of it. I had already started to turn the corner. But that definitely helped me to focus.” Did the psychedelic experience change him? “Hopefully it has made me a more honest, nicer, kinder person ... I’ve historically been very kind with Martha, but not with humanity as a whole. She’s happy to see me making moves in that direction.” • Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/paralysed-swedish-woman-london-cannot-return-home-bureaucracy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Paralysed Swedish woman in London cannot return home due to bureaucracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/paralysed-swedish-woman-london-cannot-return-home-bureaucracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/paralysed-swedish-woman-london-cannot-return-home-bureaucracy","fields":{"headline":"Paralysed Swedish woman in London cannot return home due to bureaucracy","bodyText":"A Swedish woman left paralysed after a catastrophic bike accident has been stranded in a London hospital for more than a year after efforts to repatriate her to her home country failed due to Stockholm bureaucracy. The situation, described by her husband as “shameful”, comes following a similar case in which authorities threatened to deport a 74-year-old British woman with Alzheimer’s because of strict adherence to Brexit red tape. Karin*, 52, a polling company executive, had been living in London for more than 25 years when she sustained a severe brain injury from hitting her head on the pavement after coming off her bike last March. Her injuries are so severe that she has spent the past year being moved from one intensive care unit and one hospital to another, requiring a series of life-saving surgeries and procedures. She is now in a high-dependency unit in a London hospital but her husband, Tom, wants to take her home to Sweden where he, Karin and their 12-year-old son could be close to her mother and three siblings. But because she has lived out of the country for so long she has fallen off Sweden’s official population register and cannot be considered eligible for care in its healthcare system. Her husband has been told he can present documents to get her relisted as resident in Sweden on her behalf but only when his wife, who cannot walk or talk, is physically in the country. In a shattering catch-22 situation the NHS cannot transfer her to the Swedish healthcare system because hospitals there cannot receive a patient who is not on the population register. The family’s local MP, Labour’s Helen Hayes, who has been supporting them since January, described the case as shocking. “Karin’s accident was a terrible tragedy which is devastating for Karin and her family. She is currently trapped between two wholly incompatible and inflexible systems. “This impasse is compounding the family’s suffering,” said Hayes, adding that the case demanded “basic compassion from all sides” to find a solution for an extremely vulnerable citizen of the country. She has written to the Europe affairs minister, Leo Docherty, urging him to seek a meeting between UK and Sweden officials “with the hope that both countries can work together outside existing protocols”. “As this is truly an exceptional case, this will require exceptional actions by both the UK government and the Swedish government, as well as by the NHS and Swedish health professionals,” she wrote. Sweden’s refusal to allow an exception to the rules for a vulnerable citizen has shocked Karin’s family, and her husband believes many other emigrants from Sweden will be unaware of the consequences of falling off the population register. “I’ve been with Karin a long time and been to Sweden many times and I was under the impression that Sweden was a compassionate western liberal democracy,” he said. He said the Foreign, Commonweath and Development Office (FCDO) said it would assist on the costly medical evacuation, support he desperately needs given he has been unable to work since his wife’s accident. “I am very down about this. I feel this is shameful. Karin is very Swedish and, in many ways, she really loves her country and loves to go back and spend summers there. We had been making plans to retire there in the next year or so and the fact that they’ve so severely let her down is quite awful,” he added. Tom has dedicated his life to caring for his wife, even writing to 349 MPs at the Riksdag in Sweden. He got a reply from only one, who expressed his sympathy but said he was unable to resolve the situation. Tom has also wrote to the European Commission and the United Nations office of the High Commission for Human Rights arguing that his wife was being discriminated against as a disabled person. They too have been unable to break the impasse. The Swedish tax authorities confirmed the rules, saying that a Swedish national could be relisted on the register by a carer once the citizen was in the country. An FCDO spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British-Swedish dual national.” *Names have been changed as the request of the family"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/22/unclenching-the-fists-review-claustrophobic-drama-full-of-trauma-and-tenderness","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Unclenching the Fists review – claustrophobic drama full of trauma and tenderness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/unclenching-the-fists-review-claustrophobic-drama-full-of-trauma-and-tenderness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/22/unclenching-the-fists-review-claustrophobic-drama-full-of-trauma-and-tenderness","fields":{"headline":"Unclenching the Fists review – claustrophobic drama full of trauma and tenderness","bodyText":"Like her partner Kantemir Balagov’s 2019 film Beanpole, there’s an uncanny claustrophobic charge to Kira Kovalenko’s family drama, though it finally exhales an equally powerful sigh of self-redemption. Milana Aguzarova stars as Ada, a young woman in a North Ossetian mining town trapped by her ailing and possessive father Zaur (Alik Karaev). He guards the only front door key, letting her and her siblings out when he chooses, and refuses to let her have an operation to correct injuries sustained during a school hostage-taking that mean she has to wear an incontinence nappy. Ada’s brother Akim (Soslan Khugaev) comes home from the city of Rostov and seems to have the self-possession and moral compass Zaur does not. He promises to get her the treatment she needs – and a shot at romance with local chancer Tamik (Arsen Khetagurov), who has been hovering. But there’s an unsettling ambivalence to his help, expressed in their fraught confrontations and intense embraces; an incestuous undertone that younger brother Dakko (Khetag Bibilov), who tries to climb into Ada’s bed like a small child, is also subject to. It’s tempting – especially with the apparent reference to the Beslan school siege – to see the film as some kind of allegory for patriarchal and poisoned Russian society, but that underestimates its strong emotional fidelity to its characters on their own terms. They’re continually cuddling, tussling, grappling – and Kovalenko stays in close proximity all the better to make us feel this centripetal pressure Ada wants to flee. This in-your-face physicality has echoes of Russian classic Come and See. But here it’s offset with black humour, as when Zaur, trying to return Ada’s passport, has a seizure that means he literally can’t let go of her. Aguzarova is quietly phenomenal, never more so than in the sex scene where, holding her curled-up hands away from Tamik’s body, she manages to be coy, conflicted, detached, expectant and amused all at once. Like the rest of this touching film, it’s comfortable with letting trauma and tenderness coexist. • Unclenching the Fists is available on Mubi on 26 May, and is streaming now on Stan in Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2023/may/22/fancy-bear-goes-phishing-by-scott-shapiro-review-a-gripping-study-of-five-extraordinary-hacks","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Fancy Bear Goes Phishing by Scott Shapiro review – a gripping study of five extraordinary hacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/fancy-bear-goes-phishing-by-scott-shapiro-review-a-gripping-study-of-five-extraordinary-hacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/22/fancy-bear-goes-phishing-by-scott-shapiro-review-a-gripping-study-of-five-extraordinary-hacks","fields":{"headline":"Fancy Bear Goes Phishing by Scott Shapiro review – a gripping study of five extraordinary hacks","bodyText":"As we head towards 2030, a terrible realisation is dawning on us – that we have built a world that is critically dependent on a set of technologies that almost nobody understands, and which are also extremely fragile and insecure. Fancy Bear Goes Phishing seeks to tackle both sides of this dilemma: our collective ignorance, on the one hand, and our insecurity on the other. Its author says that he embarked on the project seeking an understanding of just three things. Why is the internet so insecure? How (and why) do the hackers who exploit its vulnerabilities do what they do? And what can be done about it? In ornithological terms, Scott Shapiro is a pretty rare bird – an eminent legal scholar who is also a geek. Wearing one hat (or perhaps a wig), he teaches jurisprudence, constitutional law, legal philosophy and related topics to Yale students. But wearing different headgear (a reversed baseball cap?), he is also the founding director of the university’s cybersecurity lab, which does pretty good research on security and information technology generally. Shapiro was fascinated by computers from a young age, and for a time was a computer science major at Columbia University and a startup entrepreneur. But eventually legal philosophy got a grip on him and he wound up with a professorship in a law school. Embarking on the book forced him to revisit his past: relearning old programming languages; coming to terms with Unix, Linux and other operating systems, internet protocols and database technology; and wading through the weeds of malicious software – worms, viruses, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and other loathsome creatures of the cyberdeep. Most authors in his position would probably have shirked such technicalities. After all, nothing breaks a narrative like a discussion of musings on the “physicality principle” (which states that computation is a physical process of symbol manipulation), the Hungarian-American mathematician and physicist John von Neumann’s adventures with cellular automata, or Microsoft’s failure to get to grips with TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). And yet Shapiro doesn’t blink, and manages to carve a readable path through the conceptual undergrowth. It’s an impressive achievement. His technique for creating a narrative is to pick five epic hacks, each of which illustrates salient points about the networked world in which we are now enmeshed. He starts with the Morris worm, a program innocently released by a Cornell University student in 1988 that brought the internet to a grinding halt. This is a well-known story that has been told many times, but Shapiro’s account is the most illuminating I’ve seen, largely because it brings out the fiendish ingenuity of Robert Morris’s little program – and in the process justifies Shapiro’s decision not to shirk technicalities when telling the tale. The second hack takes him to an unlikely place: Bulgaria in the 1980s – the world’s first centre of excellence in creating computer viruses – and to the battle between an exceptionally gifted hacker, the “Dark Avenger”, and his nemesis, the antivirus expert Vesselin Bontchev. This chapter also required Shapiro effectively to become a sociologist of hacking, seeking an understanding of who hackers are and what motivates them. From Bulgaria the story moves to the US in the 00s and the hacking of Paris Hilton’s phone, followed by Microsoft’s introduction of the Visual Basic programming language into its Office suite of programs. The idea was to enable users of the software to automate routine tasks. The unintended consequence was that it also enabled the “macro” viruses – such as Melissa and ILOVEYOU – that infected Microsoft Word and brought nearly every office in the western world to a halt for a few weeks. The fourth hack is what gives the book its title – the hacking by Russian agencies of the Democratic National Committee’s computers in 2016 and the subsequent release of a huge trove of emails that were damaging to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Again, this is a story we thought we knew, but Shapiro’s account is detailed and fascinating, and still leaves you wondering whether the hack played a role in Clinton’s defeat. Shapiro’s final hack is about the “botnet wars” – in which virtual armies of compromised networked devices are marshalled to deliver paralysing DDoS attacks on targeted websites – and the subsequent evolution of DDoS as a service. Once upon a time, that kind of destructive hacking required significant technical nous. Now it just requires a credit card and malign intent. What are the takeaways from this absorbing tour of cyberspace’s netherworld? Four things stand out. One: “Hacking is not a dark art, and those who practise it are not 400lb wizards or idiot savants.” Two: it’s not a hobby, but a business, conducted by rational people out to make a living, or a killing. Just like bankers, in fact. Three: we could do a lot to reduce our vulnerability to it, but governments will first have to make it a crime not to take precautions. And four: mass media plays a really malignant role by providing an endless loop of scare stories and zero understanding of the problem. • Fancy Bear Goes Phishing: The Dark History of the Information Age, in Five Extraordinary Hacks by Scott Shapiro is published by Allen Lane (£25).

The Studio Buds+ cost £179.99 ($169.99) and, as the name suggests, are enhanced versions of the already good Studio Buds from 2021. The size and shape remains identical to the older buds, which means they are just as compact and fit well, coming with four sizes of earbud tips. While they are sweat resistant, I wouldn’t rely on them for exercise as they lack stabilising wings to keep them in place. The top of the bud projects slightly from your ear making them easy to grip. The “b” button handles controls: press once for pause/play, twice and thrice for track skip, or press and hold to switch noise-cancelling modes or adjust the volume. The battery lasts about six hours for playback with noise-cancelling, which is an hour longer than their predecessors and is better than many competitors. The case is pocketable but slightly bigger than the best. It can fully charge the earbuds three additional times for a total playback time of about 24 hours. The case takes two hours to charge via USB-C, while a five-minute quick charge is enough for an hour’s playback when low. Apple and Android connectivity A big advantage of the Beats is the extensive cross-compatibility between Android and iOS. Made by Apple, they have greater integration with an iPhone than competitors, including hands-free Siri, access to controls through quick settings, instant pairing and iCloud syncing. You only need to pair with one Apple device to use them across iPhones, iPads, Macs and other gear. But they also support similar features on Android with instant pairing and syncing between Google devices, including auto-switching between Android and Chromebooks. Controls and other settings are accessible via the Beats app, which also includes battery widgets and other features. The earbuds integrate into Apple’s and Google’s Find My systems, so that you can locate them if you misplace them regardless of platform. Specifications Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC Battery life: 6 hours ANC/9 hours off, up to 24 hours with case Water resistance: IPX4 (sweat) Earbud weight: 5g each Earbud dimensions: 15.6 x 21.6 x 19.8mm Charging case weight: 49g Charging case dimensions: 51.5 x 73 x 25.6mm Case charging: USB-C Upgraded sound and noise-cancelling The Buds+ sound a little fuller than their predecessors, producing good easy-listening audio across a range of genres. They are capable of hitting deep notes, but the bass is nicely controlled and accompanied by well-balanced treble and high tones. They can’t beat the best from Sennheiser or Sony, lacking a little energy at times, but they avoid sounding overly clinical with suitable rawness when required. Their predecessor’s problem of noise-cancelling affecting the sound has been much improved for the new buds. The earbuds support spatial audio on Android and for Apple Music on iOS but do not support head tracking or more advanced surround sound features for movies. Noise-cancelling reduces the nuisance sounds of a city better than the buds’ predecessors. They effectively suppress rumbles, thumps and other lower notes, and manage to dampen higher tones better than before, but voices, keyboard taps and similar still break though when not listening to music. The Buds+ can’t match the best from Bose or the AirPods Pro but they are decent for the money and size. The transparency mode is also improved, sounding more natural and open, easily good enough to hold a conversation or listen out for traffic. Call quality in quiet environments was crisp and clear if a little low in volume. My voice was clear on noisy streets with very little background noise audible on the call. Sustainability Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. Apple offers a “battery service” for £85, while replacement buds and cases are available. The earbuds and case are made from recycled plastic, tin and rare earth elements but Apple does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The Beats Studio Buds+ cost £179.99 ($169.99) and will be in store from 13 June. For comparison, the Beats Studio Buds cost £160, the Beats Fit Pro cost £220, the Apple AirPods Pro 2 cost £249, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 cost £99, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro cost £179 and the Nothing Ear 2 cost £129. Verdict The Studio Buds+ are another great set of earbuds from Apple that court Android users as much as those with iPhones. They build on their predecessors with a compact fit, good sound, solid noise-cancelling and longer battery life. But it is their support of enhanced features on multiple platforms that makes them appealing. If you use an Android phone with an iPad or Mac or some other combination of devices, the Buds+ are one of the best options available. In their transparent colour option they are particularly good-looking. But the battery is not replaceable and the earbuds are not repairable, ultimately making them disposable and losing them a star. Pros: good sound and solid noise-cancelling, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android, great battery life and case, compact and comfortable fit, good button controls. Cons: do not pause music on removal, no head-tracking spatial audio, onboard controls for either volume or noise-cancelling but not both, not repairable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/may/22/a-broker-told-me-i-dont-earn-enough-for-a-london-mortgage-is-that-true","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"A broker told me I don’t earn enough for a London mortgage.

I am a tailor, I didn’t go to university – so have no student debt – and I have worked since I was 13 in various jobs. Both my sisters have moved out to study or live with partners, so I am feeling more and more like I need to leave and live my life on my own terms, and all the other things that being in your own space allows. Tailors don’t earn a lot of money, I’m on £26,000 now, which I hope to negotiate this year up to £28,000 to £30,000. I don’t live lavishly and living at home has allowed me to save a deposit of about £60,000. I want to buy a flat in London to be closer to work, friends and everything else. Renting isn’t something I feel is an option. My salary is fairly low but stable. If I move and the landlord decides to hike the rent I would not have any option but to move back home. I’ve looked into joint borrower sole proprietor mortgages but am limited by the mortgage term being age-dependent as my mum is almost 63, shortening the loan term and making it unaffordable. No lender would go much beyond £80,000 on my salary alone. My parents don’t want to use their house as security to my mortgage as they near retirement, and could help me with perhaps a couple of thousand pounds towards the deposit, but not more. I suspect there isn’t a magic bullet, and I’m trapped as many people in my situation are. I’ve spoken to a broker and he says basically it’s a no unless I make more money. It all feels a little futile. I’ve done all the right things – worked, not got into debt, saved as much as I could. But now I can’t afford to move out into the local area as it’s much too expensive and I can’t afford to move to the city either. NC A You suspect correctly: there is no magic bullet. But there are options. You are right that your mother’s age is a stumbling block when it comes to getting a joint borrower sole proprietor mortgage with quite a lot of lenders but before you rule out this type of loan altogether, I think you should try out this tool on onlinemortgageadvisor.co.uk. The fact that you can put down a deposit of £60,000 will certainly work in your favour as “putting down a big deposit usually gets you access to more deals”, according to the site’s Pete Mugleston. He says that on any residential mortgage, most lenders allow you to borrow four and a half times your income. So that would mean that with your £60,000 deposit and a mortgage of £135,000 – based on earnings of £30,000 – you could afford to buy a flat costing £195,000. However, if that is not enough and you are not able to go down the joint borrower sole proprietor mortgage route, you may want to investigate part-rent, part-buy shared ownership schemes such as the one run by the housing provider Peabody."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2023/may/22/rac-was-supposed-to-get-my-broken-down-car-home-but-its-lost-it","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"RAC was supposed to get my broken-down car home.

In April, while in Devon, the clutch went on my Honda. Having been a member for about 20 years, I called the RAC. It said it could not be fixed at the roadside. I asked for the car to be taken to my home and was told it would take three days. That was the last time I saw it. It is now 16 days later and no one can tell me where my car is. All it says is that it should have arrived 3-5 days after the breakdown. In the end I reported it stolen, to police, and my insurer. The latter has provided me with a hire car, so at least I am back on the road. I can’t quite believe this is happening. AR, Berkshire A decade ago we generally received more letters praising the RAC than complaints, but it is very much the opposite these days. The day before I took up your case, the car was mysteriously delivered back without any explanation. However, you soon realised the rear window wasn’t the original, and that its de-mist function didn’t work. It appears the third-party recovery operator, contracted by the RAC to deliver the car, somehow managed to smash the window, and the delay had been caused by the time it took to source a replacement. Had the RAC/its contractor come clean at the start, it would have saved you a huge amount of hassle – and expense. Now you have told your insurer that the vehicle has been found, it has decided you were not entitled to its courtesy car and will bill you for its supply. As a result of my intervention, the RAC has agreed to send someone to repair the de-mist function. It has also apologised and agreed to reimburse your car hire costs. It still hasn’t offered an explanation. “This wasn’t handled by our contractor in the way it should have been and falls far below the standard we expect from our partners, which we’ve addressed with them directly,” it says.

Immediately, the cove is filled with terrible swearwords: I force myself to stay in the water, spluttering and cursing but growing less cold with each swimming stroke. Hours later, sipping coffee while overlooking another deserted beach, my skin is still zinging and my mood is irritatingly smug. A dunking in the bay is an apt way to start the day on Herm. The tiny, comma-shaped Channel Island – stretching just under 1.5 miles from top to bottom, and less than half a mile across – feels like a place cut adrift. This is emphatically a good thing. The island has a permanent population of 65 and a history that yawns back to the Neolithic era. Puffins breed on its southern cliffs; rabbits nibble in its flower meadows; migrant warblers cluster in its pine groves. You’ll find no cars, or even bikes, and the primary school has four pupils. The island’s name sounds like a hesitation, but its pretty hills, woods and beaches demand to be savoured in the here and now. Well, most of the time. Shortly after my arrival on the 15-minute boat crossing from Guernsey, a spring downpour brings gale-force winds and horizontal rain. It gives me the chance to do an inventory of the harbourside buildings – one hotel, two pubs, a handful of stone cottages, an old prison big enough for one – and to watch the waves being whipped into a dark fury. When the storm passes and the sun returns the island feels washed clean, the sands flowing white into a turquoise sea. I’m here for a short visit, partly to find out more about Herm’s drive to become less carbon-reliant. “I always say the scenery is a mix between the Caribbean, the North York Moors and the Pembrokeshire coastline,” says the island’s CEO Craig Senior. (Yes, an island with a CEO: Herm is owned by the States of Guernsey, which leases it for use as a visitor destination. The current tenants are former Guernsey residents John and Julia Singer, who had their first date on Herm in the mid-90s and took on the lease in 2008.) Craig is a gregarious Rotherham United fan, here since 2019 with his wife and children. He is tailed by his dog, Harvey, who has the run of the island and is possibly the world’s happiest sproodle. “Herm’s part of the British Isles, it’s part of the Channel Islands, but more than anything it’s just Herm,” he says. There’s simultaneously lots to do – eat, drink, swim, walk, kayak, birdwatch, jog, mooch, poke your nose into the millennium-old chapel, stargaze, sleep – and little in the way of diversion. If that sounds contradictory, welcome to Herm. As well as the White House hotel, which has sea views and serves classy evening meals, visitors can stay in self-catering cottages or at one of two campsites. The island knows how to draw a crowd in summer (among its various events, Utah Saints played a gig here in 2022, with DJ-producer Sasha doing the same this September), but in the shoulder season it feels like a seaborne secret. It’s also somewhere that is trying to do things the right way. Herm has been making strides to become more eco-friendly over the last couple of years. The Isle of Herm ferry service from Guernsey runs on biofuel – hydrotreated vegetable oil – and 60% of the boilers on the island have been converted to do the same, with the rest to follow. Solar panels are at campsite washblocks, and a tender is out for a solar energy farm in one of the more isolated meadows. “We’re on a bit of a journey,” says Craig. While there is more to be done to reduce the island’s footprint, he is proud of what has been achieved. Six nature trail boards have recently been erected around the coast, a granite quarry has been reinvented as a zen garden, and all glass bottles are now crushed to provide hardcore for the shaggy-hedged lanes that thread the island. Craig suggests I take a stroll around Herm’s perimeter. The coastal path looks simple but hides nooks within nooks. The north of the island is low and sandy, dotted with rock pools and ancient tombs, while the south is high and wooded. There are bluebell drifts and deep caves, eucalyptus thickets and headlands that attract kestrels, gorse plateaux and hulking sea stacks. There are puffins in Puffin Bay and shells on Shell Beach. The ferry is coming into Herm’s harbour when I start the walk, and again when I finish two hours later. I get chatting to the skipper, Chad Murray, who has sailed these waters since doing a Duke of Edinburgh award, when he was 12. He’s Guernsey-based but used to come to Herm for Christmas with his children, bringing his own spruce tree across on the boat. “I love it over here. It’s just calming. It’s also a designated Ramsar site, which means it’s a wetland of international importance,” he says. Murray is planning on introducing summer boat tours around the island, to allow people to spot seals, seabirds and other marine life. I spend the next two days moving at Herm pace. I rent a kayak and bob along the east coast, staring at Sark as terns dive into the waves for fish. I meander around the lanes, listening to wrens and chiffchaffs singing in the blackthorn. I watch guillemots flying low over the sea, past the humped neighbouring isle of Jethou. I learn that the woman who runs the beach cafe is also one of the island’s firefighters (three callouts in five years, though nothing calamitous), and that the man who looks after waste management is also the island’s police officer (no one can remember the last arrest). And I try Channel Island ales at the Mermaid Tavern, where the ceiling is covered in pump-clips and cabbage palms stand over the beer garden. The Singers are passionate about looking after the island’s natural environment. This is evident when I join five residents for a beach clean, something arranged several times a year. It’s reassuringly fruitless. We spend 45 minutes walking two beaches and find a couple of washed-up plastic stirrers, a length of ship’s rope and a copper oxide-coated penny from the reign of King George VI. Previous custodians of the island have been similarly committed to keeping Herm unspoiled (with the possible exception of the Prussian prince who held the tenancy in the early 1900s and introduced wallabies). The most longstanding tenants were Peter and Jenny Wood, here for almost half a century from 1949. Jenny summed up Herm as a place “where time has trod lightly and the passing centuries made little impress on the lovely contours”. Well, quite. The island is a joy. Just brace yourself if you’re taking a sunrise dip. The White House hotel has doubles from £145 B&amp;B (from £237 in July-Aug). Self-catering cottages from £261 for three nights (or from £1,204 for minimum seven nights in July-Aug). Equipped camping from £85 a night in a tent sleeping six to eight.

If only I could afford Freddie Mercury’s moustache comb …","bodyText":"Publicity kicked off last month for the auction of Freddie Mercury’s possessions: furniture, art and trinkets go under the hammer in September, plus handwritten lyrics, stage props and a waistcoat decorated with portraits of his cats. It might even top last year’s Joan Didion auction, at which literary groupies outbid each other for the cult writer’s stained napkins and novelty aprons: people paid $11,000 a piece for unused blank notebooks. If your curiosity is piqued, but you don’t have Tiffany moustache comb money (another Mercury lot), can I recommend seeking out a civilian version? I’m an auction addict. It’s my husband’s fault: he discovered our local auction house – a paradise of outdated agricultural machinery, brown furniture and bargain white goods (he equipped our kitchen for next to nothing) – and has infected me. Only yesterday, I spent 40 blissful minutes scrolling through toby jugs, horse brasses, lawnmowers and a puzzling number of signed photos of Rex Harrison. Auctions have all the ethical advantages of vintage – the acceptable face of shopping – plus bonus elements. Like in any charity shop, I don’t want 98% of the stuff, but browsing scratches my consumerist itch. Then, for the odd things I do covet, bidding is such a rush: sweaty fingers clawed around my mouse, I watch the thumbnail video of the bored auctioneer and calculate whether a puffin-themed plate is worth another fiver, while speculating furiously about my rival bidder until the hammer falls. The endorphins, the drama! Some people get that from eBay, but auctions have more louche, mothball-scented glamour. They are also brilliant for the pathologically nosy. Like the celeb versions, many sales at my local are house clearances, and it’s a window into another, exotic life – how did you end up acquiring an empty Swedish pistol holster, you wonder; why so many stuffed stoats? And finally, paradoxically, they act as a brake on my own acquisitive impulses. Often, I only have to imagine someone decades hence scrolling judgmentally through my dusty bird-themed junk to step away from the bidding on the owl mug. I’ve still got my eye on a bargain bird bath tomorrow, though. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The bill, which could be put to a public hearing in the next few days, passed its second reading in the Nigerian parliament’s lower house last month. However, the plan is being met with resistance, with the doctors’ union and civil society organisations fiercely opposed. Calling it “obnoxious and outlandish”, Dr Innocent Orji, the president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, said: “We are going to resist the bill. The bill should be withdrawn immediately. It is a waste of taxpayers’ money.” However, the government is pressing ahead, hoping to address the huge problem of brain drain among Nigeria’s medical professionals and set a timeline to recoup investment by the country’s education system. Ganiyu Johnson, a lawmaker and leading advocate for the bill, has put out a statement on social and mainstream media, addressed to medical students and doctors. “The government has invested so much money in training these medical doctors,” he said. “If the government subsidised your tuition, the least we expect is that … you can give back to society within the period of five years.” In the past few years, strikes in the country’s health sector have become more frequent and prolonged. Take-home wages for doctors have remained static for more than a decade, despite a government promise to review pay every five years. Job insecurity has also grown. “These are the factors making the doctors leave. I don’t think the government understands this yet,” Chidiebere Echieh, a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Calabar, said. Echieh said his own career mirrored his concerns. He graduated from medical school in 2007, and his salary has remained stagnant despite further training since then. For all his experience and skills as a senior surgeon, he is paid the equivalent of about £800 a month, far less than medical graduates in most developed countries. In 2022, Echieh visited the US for a postgraduate programme at the University of Arizona where, he said, he saw the contrast in health technology between his own country and the US. It is another factor driving Nigerian doctors abroad. “There are so many healthcare technologies that are not available in Nigeria. For people – medical personnel – to have first-hand experience using these technologies, they have to travel outside Nigeria,” Echieh said. “No matter how long you practise in Nigeria, without hands-on experience of these technologies, your mastery will be limited.” In public health, gaps in technology become death counts. Doctors have reported a rise in trauma and depression, which they claim is caused by too many avoidable deaths across Nigerian hospitals. “It is painful for a doctor who knows what to do to see their patient dying because the right technology is not there to save those lives,” Orji said. “It causes depression to watch people die of easily treatable health conditions due to a lack of basic technology and equipment.” The government and doctors now agree the situation has reached crisis point. Despite Nigeria’s population of 218 million, the country only has 24,000 licensed doctors. The World Health Organization included Nigeria on its recent red list to discourage other countries from hunting an already depleted medical workforce. The UK is the biggest recruiter of Nigerian doctors, alongside Canada, the US and Saudi Arabia. Between 2015 and 2021, the Development Research and Projects Centre, a Nigeria-based not-for-profit, estimates that nearly 5,000 doctors relocated to the UK. Nigerian doctors say that the country’s private sector suffers even more than the state-funded system. In 2020, Hameed Adediran established Crest Care Services, which provides home care for elderly people and those with special needs. Although common in the west, the concept is novel in Nigeria. Staff go through specialist training and retraining but rarely stay long. In Adediran’s view, the company has become a stopgap for doctors heading for the exit. “It is difficult to retain our personnel for long because the person you are hiring is either on his way out or is already out but working to save up his flight fare.” The fear is that other private health entrepreneurs might be discouraged from investing in employee training, with knock-on effects on the quality of care. Competition for jobs abroad is stiff, taking only the best skilled. Those who fail to make the grade might be forced to stay unwillingly in their home country. This, Adediran said, can lead to low motivation and poor standards of service. Chima Christian, a Nigeria-based public affairs analyst, takes a different view of the brain drain. “This is a great opportunity [for graduates],” he said. “There is high demand for Nigeria’s skilled workforce. So much so that we can literally export these people and earn more foreign currencies through remittances. Today, our new oil is human beings.” More investment was needed in universities, he said, to train more young Nigerians in in-demand fields. The country would then have enough workers to meet its needs back home, without limiting the ambitions of those who want to work abroad. Christian has a point. In the past three years, diaspora remittances have emerged as Nigeria’s leading source of foreign earnings excluding the oil industry. In 2021, Nigerians abroad sent home $20bn – at least four times the country’s entire foreign direct investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/land-ownership-scotland-corporations-forestry-companies-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"Wealthy firms buying Scottish land pose risk of greater inequality, study warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/land-ownership-scotland-corporations-forestry-companies-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/land-ownership-scotland-corporations-forestry-companies-report","fields":{"headline":"Wealthy firms buying Scottish land pose risk of greater inequality, study warns","bodyText":"Land ownership in Scotland is at risk of becoming more elitist and unequal because wealthy corporations and forestry companies are dramatically driving up land prices, a new study has warned. The report from the Scottish Land Commission found that a significant number of Highland estates and hill farms were sought by corporations last year as an investment or as sites for planting new conifer plantations. Their purchases added to an overheating land market in Scotland that has driven prices to record levels, the commission said. Financial investors, foresters, farmers and wealthy conservationists are chasing the same estates and farms once they go on sale. This adds to Scotland’s very concentrated pattern of land ownership, it said, by making it harder for younger farmers, environmental groups, local communities and less-wealthy buyers to afford the higher prices. Last year the commission reported that a surge in land prices in Scotland in 2020 and 2021 was driven heavily by corporations and wealthy individuals wanting to invest in so-called natural capital projects. Called “green lairds” by some critics, those buyers were keen on projects to restore peatland, create new forests and enhance nature conservation as climate-friendly ways of storing CO2 and increasing biodiversity. The commission’s latest report, based on interviews by Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC) with dozens of estate agents and experts, found the interest among natural capital buyers waned last year, with a shift towards companies seeing land as a purely financial or commercial asset. As in 2020 and 2021, those firms have tended to be absentee owners. They may have little interest in changing what the land is used for, which leads to stability for tenants and estate staff, but it means the land is not used for more beneficial purposes. Andrew Thin, the commission’s chair, said these trends risked reinforcing existing inequalities. Scotland has one of the least-regulated land markets in Europe; comparable countries in western and northern Europe limit the size of estates and have strict residency rules. “A smaller pool of well-resourced purchasers were the most active in the market, whether these be large-scale forestry interests, expansionist agricultural businesses, institutional or corporate investors, or wealthy individuals,” Thin said. The commission’s study also identified important contradictions between different government policy priorities. In some cases, forestry companies bought cattle and sheep farms to grow timber. Replacing cattle with trees means carbon emissions from farming will fall while carbon sequestration by trees will increase. As Scotland has failed to cut carbon emissions from farming and is forecast to miss its tough targets to cut CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030, that is a policy benefit. Conversely, the higher prices and growth in commercial forests undermine policies to increase nature diversity and economic diversity in rural areas. Hamish Trench, the commission’s chief executive, said that added to the pressure on the Scottish government to intervene in a new land reform bill due to be tabled later this year. He said that could include new public interest tests on companies seeking state subsidies for tree-growing or nature conservation, and new requirements for absentee owners to involve local communities in their estates, such as shared-ownership models or leasing their land. Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, the umbrella body for landowners, said it “fundamentally disagreed” with the commission’s conclusions. She said government data showed a surge in community ownership in Scotland. “Where there is a genuine desire by communities to own land, legislation already exists to make that happen,” she said. Laing said the government itself was Scotland’s largest landowner, and large-scale operations were often very effective. “Purchases of large-scale landholdings do create opportunities for other businesses, enterprises and communities to benefit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/monday-briefing-can-lula-save-the-amazon-rainforest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:57:45Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: What it will take to reverse the damage done to the rainforest by Jair Bolsonaro","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/monday-briefing-can-lula-save-the-amazon-rainforest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/monday-briefing-can-lula-save-the-amazon-rainforest","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: What it will take to reverse the damage done to the rainforest by Jair Bolsonaro","bodyText":"Good morning. When Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – Lula – was sworn in as president of Brazil on 1 January, one of his tentpole commitments was a promise to reduce the deforestation that was rampant under Jair Bolsonaro to zero by 2030. That is a hugely ambitious policy. But with the Amazon teetering on the brink of an irreversible tipping point beyond from which it would not be able to regenerate itself – leaving the world without its most important carbon store – it is also a necessary one. Five months in, advocates for the Amazon see hugely promising signs in the government’s work so far – like a 68% drop in deforestation last month. But we will soon arrive at the peak burning season, where political signals must give way to concrete outcomes on the ground. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s global environment editor – and resident of the Amazonian town of Altamira – Jonathan Watts, is about the progress so far, and how much is left to do. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK politics | Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure to launch an investigation into whether Suella Braverman broke the ministerial code by requesting a private speed awareness course. Downing Street confirmed Sunak would consult with his ethics adviser when he returns from the G7 in Japan. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskiy has rejected Russian claims to have captured Bakhmut, insisting its forces still have a foothold in the Donbas city and are steadily encircling the Russian mercenaries holding the ruined town centre. Meanwhile at the G7 summit, Joe Biden announced new military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m). Social media | Facebook is to be fined more than €746m (£648m) and ordered to suspend data transfers to the US as an Irish regulator prepares to punish the social media network for its handling of user information. The fine will set a record for a breach of the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR). Hygiene | A branch of Britain’s largest private childcare provider has been hit with a record fine after inspectors found fresh mouse droppings in the kitchen and the children’s play areas of a nursery in east London. The fine of £225,000 for Busy Bees is understood to be one of the largest of its type levied on a single site. Protest | A group of activists who were arrested at a seven-hour seminar on the theory of protest five miles from Westminster Abbey on the day of the coronation have spoken of their bemusement at what they believe was a case of mistaken identity. One told the Guardian: “They were saying that we were Just Stop Oil and that we were going to disrupt the coronation. And I was just like: ‘Absolutely not’.” In depth: ‘Forests must be worth more alive than dead’ The figures tell their own story. During Jair Bolsonaro’s four years in office, more than 45,000 square kilometres of the Amazon was lost, an increase of 55% on the previous four years. In 2021 alone, more than 1,000 trees were cut down every minute. That devastation was the consequence of rapacious development policies that saw budgets for programmes protecting Indigenous people and the environment slashed. Meanwhile, loggers, cattle ranchers and miners who razed supposedly protected lands were allowed to operate with impunity. Last summer land clearances accelerated in anticipation of Bolsonaro’s defeat, with an increase in fires being deliberately lit. Jonathan Watts saw one of those fires burning not far from his home in Altamira territory (and wrote about it here). For all the ambition of Lula’s pledge to reverse that trend, he “is not an environmentalist by instinct,” Jonathan said. “He’s a trade union guy he is naturally focused on jobs and poverty. But he knows how important this is.” His record from his first period in office in the 2000s is clear: policies instituted by his crucially important environment minister, Marina Silva, reduced the deforestation rate in the Amazon by more than 80%. Silva resigned in 2008 after a series of acrimonious battles over her policies – but Lula named her to the same post in December. “She is the real guiding force,” Jonathan said. “As long as she is there, the government has credibility.” But it won’t be easy. “As impressive as what they did last time is, they protected the Amazon at the expense of Brazil’s other globally important biomes,” Jonathan said – particularly the Cerrado tropical savanna in the east. “This time, they have said they will have zero deforestation anywhere. So it’s a big step up.” *** Why is the rainforest being destroyed? The biggest single cause of deforestation is cattle ranching: about 70% of illegally cleared land is used for ranching, and there are now 90 million cows in the Amazon, grazing an area about the size of France. Crop production is also a significant feature, above all soy. Gold mining, illegal logging of high-value tree species, and the development of roads and other infrastructure also play a part. You can see the stakes of all this, and the ruthlessness of those who profit from deforestation, in outrages against defenders of the Amazon like the murders of Guardian journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous advocate Bruno Pereira. “That happened even when the people responsible for land grabbing and environmental crimes had an ally as president,” Jonathan said. “Now they may feel more of a need to resort to those measures. But it may also be that the authorities feel more compelled to protect defenders, and punish those who are responsible.” A fundamental part of the problem, Jonathan notes, is global demand for the ensuing products – particularly beef. “We’ve had really positive news on that in the last few months, when the EU signed a new law banning imports of anything linked to deforestation. But the key is China – by far the biggest buyer of products from Brazil.” More generally, there are calls for rich countries to contribute more to the funds directed to create incentives for farmers and land-grabbers to stop destroying the Amazon. In this superb dispatch last December, Jonathan wrote that nothing is likely to shift without a change to a “nature positive” economy: “The goal must be for Brazil and other ecosystem-rich countries to receive more revenue from maintaining their biomes than from clearing them. Farmers need to become stewards. Forests must be worth more alive than dead.” *** Why is this so urgent and so hard? The crisis in the Amazon is all the more acute because of scientists’ fears that we are close to an irreversible change – the tipping point at which the rainforest has degraded so much that it can no longer regenerate itself, dries out, and turns into a savannah, with far less capacity for carbon storage. In parts of the south and south-east of the rainforest, as Jonathan explains here, that has already been happening, and the forest is emitting more carbon than it absorbs. 17% of the entire rainforest has now been cleared; the best estimate of the tipping point is at 20 to 25%, which could happen within a few years. But Lula’s government must tackle the crisis with severe limitations on its ability to act. Because of Bolsonaro, “the state probably has half the capacity that it did during the last Lula administration,” Jonathan said. “So initially, a lot of this is about sending signals that there are smart ways to do this nonetheless, and that the Brazilian state is back.” *** What has Lula achieved so far? In his inauguration speech, Lula emphasised the role of the Indigenous people who have been custodians of the Amazon for thousands of years. Indigenous people, he said, “are guardians of our rivers and forests and a fundamental part of our greatness as a nation”. To that end, he appointed the country’s first Indigenous affairs minister Sonia Guajajara (with Lula above), and appointed the first Indigenous woman to lead the federal Indigenous affairs agency, Funai. (Bolsonaro’s pick, Marcelo Xavier da Silva, was a police officer with ties to agribusiness, and poisoned the agency’s function so that instead of protecting Indigenous territories it became an engine of their seizure.) Early legislative and practical measures include restoring the authority of the environmental protection agency, assigning new funds to prevent deforestation, and revoking Bolsonaro legislation that encouraged illegal mining. Lula also directed a major special forces operation to drive illegal miners out of the Yanomami territory, with 327 mining camps reported destroyed by the end of April – and reports like this one of reprisals against Indigenous people. (The Guardian’s Tom Phillips wrote a remarkable embedded report on one of the units carrying out that work.) Last month, deforestation was down 68% on the same time last year. Welcome though that is, the real peak of deforestation is always in the dry season from May to October, when illegal loggers can more easily access the forest. “That is when we will really understand how much progress is being made,” Jonathan said. *** What else needs to happen? We are unlikely to see the mass expulsion of farmers and illegal land grabbers in the months ahead, Jonathan said. “I suspect there is not the capacity to do that.” But since Lula was last in office, technological tools – like satellite imagery revealing further illicit deforestation – have become much more advanced. “And a lot can be done through the banks not lending money if it’s shown a farmer hasn’t protected as much forest as they’re supposed to, or penalties where it’s happening with the threat of more to come. It’s really about the signal that the government is watching.” Other priorities could be building up capacity for future work, and raising funds from international donors. But there will also be serious tests of Lula’s commitment: a plan to turn a muddy route, BR-319, into an all-season road “that could open up a whole new part of the Amazon to deforestation”, and the question of whether he will stick by the environmental regulator’s decision last week to reject oil drilling at the mouth of the Amazon. That is viewed by some of his coalition as a threat to his promise to deliver growth to the poorest parts of Brazil. “There is going to be a battle over these things, and they test his old school development instincts,” Jonathan said. “If he backs Silva [the environment minister], we will know there is a very real change under way.” What else we’ve been reading In his tribute to Martin Amis, who has died aged 73, Geoff Dyer writes that “Every page of his writing – in any form – was steeped in his consciousness and I was besotted by that consciousness in all its forms”.

Sam Levin investigates Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad After decades of illness, including a cholera scare and bouts of malaria, Toronto’s Don River succumbed to mounting neglect and was pronounced dead in 1969. A funeral procession of environmental activists wound through the city, with mourners gathering at the polluted banks of the river to pay their final respects. After more than half a century, however, the river has roared back to life. Wildlife is gingerly returning to areas that were once the site of heavy industry. Its waters will soon become cleaner. And perhaps most unlikely of all: after decades of advocacy work from a small group of frustrated citizens, the city is spending billions to save a body of water which was long despised and feared. A C$1bn investment will create wetlands, levees and a new route for the Don. Meanwhile, the city is spending C$3bn to build three tunnels that will route untreated sewage away from the river. “There aren’t a lot of hopeful signs in the wider world today. But it’s hard not to want to hope for a better life for my children and future generations,” said John Wilson, a key figure in citizen-led group Bring Back the Don. “And so you have to hold on, as hard as you can, to the positive things that you can see ...

In a significantly delayed opening to Monday’s hearings, former Queensland solicitor general Walter Sofronoff KC said the publication of a photo taken of the ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, as he stood in the driveway of his Canberra home appeared entirely unjustified. Sofronoff said he had written to the editor of the newspaper for an explanation. The picture was published on the front page of the Australian on 19 May with the headline: “Crown Lager or Drumgold Bitter. Prosecutor Calls Beer O’clock”. “I’m stumped at trying to think of a proper purpose for doing this,” Sofronoff said. “Hiding to take a photo of a man who thinks he’s enjoying privacy and then publishing the photo with a putdown.” Sofronoff said the role of the media was vital to the inquiry, but so was the cooperation of people called to give evidence. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “My real worry is that the witnesses who’ve been willing to help me will think that this is part of the price [of cooperation] – being stalked to their home, photos taken unawares, of being made fun of in the national media. If that’s the personal cost, why would anybody willingly be a part of this? “This kind of publication risks interfering with the course of my inquiry. It risks interfering with my ability to fulfil my statutory duty.” Sofronoff said he conceded that the taking of the photograph of Drumgold– who is currently on leave – and its publication might possibly serve a valid journalistic purpose. “With these thoughts in mind, I’ve written to the editor of the Australian today seeking her help to understand the purpose for which the photo was used. And I’ll consider my course when I get a response.” The Australian has been approached for a response. Lehrmann has consistently denied the allegation of rape and no findings have been made against him. Lehrmann was tried by the ACT supreme court in October but a mistrial was declared due to juror misconduct. Prosecutors later dropped the charges against him because of fears about the impact a second trial would have on Higgins’s mental health. Drumgold is on four weeks’ voluntary leave as the inquiry continues.

The comedian, whose real name is Nigel Ng, said over the weekend that his accounts on Bilibili and Weibo, where he has 400,000 followers, had been suspended due to a “violation of relevant laws and regulations”. Both Ng and his followers suggested it was due to a clip he had posted on western social media days earlier. The clip, a promo for an forthcoming show, was posted to his Twitter account with the caption “Uncle Roger about to get cancelled”. He reposted it to YouTube a few days later. The two clips have been viewed more than 8m times. In the video clip, taken from an undated standup show, Ng, in character as Uncle Roger, asks an audience member where he comes from. The man replies that he comes from “Guangzhou, China”, to which Ng makes a face and responds “Good country! Good country!” “We have to say that now, correct? All the phones listening … this nephew got Huawei phone, they all listening,” he goes on to add. Ng then taps his phone in his pocket carefully and says: “long live President Xi, long live President Xi … phew.” He then looks for audience members from Taiwan. “Not a real country. I hope one day you rejoin the motherland,” he says, prompting laughter from the audience. Ng, who is not in China, has not specifically commented on the account suspension. Early on Monday he reposted the video to Twitter, saying: “for some reason this clip got a ton of views this past weekend. I wonder why”, and provided a pre-order link to his forthcoming show. Ng is the latest high-profile comedian who appears to have been targeted in a crackdown by Chinese authorities on comedians. Those in the country face severe punishment, and recent events have cast a chill over the industry. Earlier this month Li Haoshi, known by the stage name House, was arrested over a joke which authorities said made fun of the People’s Liberation Army, an act which was criminalised in 2021.

The AFP’s Det Supt Scott Moller had oversight of the ACT police’s investigation into Brittany Higgins’s allegation Lehrmann raped her in the Parliament House office of the then Coalition minister Linda Reynolds in 2019. Appearing before an independent inquiry into the ACT criminal justice system’s handling of the Lehrmann case, Moller said police investigators did not believe the allegations against Lehrmann had reached the threshold for prosecution. “I didn’t think there was enough evidence,” Moller said. But, based on the DPP’s advice after providing a brief of evidence, “I decided to go ahead [and charge Lehrmann]”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Moller said there was “a significant amount of pressure” on police to lay charges from “the public, the media, my own organisation”. “There was a real desire to expedite this process and get Mr Lehrmann before a court.” Moller said he was troubled that usual processes – such as an internal police “adjudication” of potential charges – were not followed. “I was concerned about not following our procedures.” Lehrmann has consistently denied the allegation of rape and no findings have been made against him. Lehrmann was tried by the ACT supreme court in October but a mistrial was declared due to juror misconduct. Prosecutors later dropped the charges against him because of fears about the impact a second trial would have on Higgins’s mental health. The inquiry, led by the former Queensland solicitor general Walter Sofronoff, is examining the actions of ACT police, prosecutors and a victim support service during the investigation and trial. Investigators provided a brief of evidence to the DPP and to Lehrmann’s defence team. The brief contained notes from meetings Higgins had with counsellors, including at the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre. Lehrmann’s lawyers did not access the notes, but the DPP, Shane Drumgold, did. Moller conceded it was a “mistake” to hand over Higgins’s counselling notes to prosecutors and to Lehrmann’s defence team. “We shouldn’t have given them,” Moller said. “That’s the bottom line, we shouldn’t have handed them over. That’s a mistake that we made.” Moller said police were acting in good faith in disclosing the documents. “From my perspective, full disclosure … for us it was about transparency and making sure we’re not holding anything back, trying to be completely open, honest and sharing everything we had. “Police and myself were acting in good faith sharing the material that we had.” Much of the independent inquiry has focused on tension between police and the DPP over the Lehrmann case. The inquiry has heard Drumgold believed police were reluctant to charge Lehrmann, and had engaged either in “unsophisticated corruption” or “atomic-level stupidity” in trying to stop the case proceeding. In correspondence, Drumgold said there was a “very clear campaign to pressure” him not to charge Lehrmann, and that police investigators were “clearly aligned with the successful defence of this matter” during the trial. Drumgold later told the inquiry he no longer believed in a possible conspiracy and that he now thought a “skills deficit” on behalf of the officers explained police actions during the investigation. From the police perspective, Moller said he believed police were being targeted by the DPP. “I felt like Mr Drumgold was attempting to collect evidence against the police for use at a later time, to show criticism of the police. I had that feeling very early on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/22/leichhardt-oval-wests-tigers-nrl-rugby-league-home-ground-history","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:05:27Z","webTitle":"Leichhardt Oval: Tigers add latest chapter to rugby league colosseum’s rich history | Angus Fontaine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/leichhardt-oval-wests-tigers-nrl-rugby-league-home-ground-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/22/leichhardt-oval-wests-tigers-nrl-rugby-league-home-ground-history","fields":{"headline":"Leichhardt Oval: Tigers add latest chapter to rugby league colosseum’s rich history","bodyText":"High on the hill at Leichhardt Oval, the sun sets in black and gold. It’s a twilight game at rugby league’s greatest colosseum, the most played-on field in the Australian game, and spiritual home to the NRL’s Wests Tigers. And as the golden late-autumn day slowly bleeds into the black of night, something magic stirs. More than 12,000 fans stream in, having arrived first in a trickle then a torrent to fill the old hill, faded bleachers and concrete grandstands. Tribes of fans and families thread through narrow streets, pour in from local pubs and move across harbour water sparkling with light. The Tigers run out in their stripes and spouts of fire light up the night. All of it black and gold. On nights like this it doesn’t matter that the Tigers are dead-last in the competition, reigning wooden spooners and winners of one premiership in the last 54 years. Even when the beer queue runs long, the portable dunnies are flooded and the PA doesn’t get above a tinny whisper, the black and gold colours never run and the Moreton Bay figs at the west end stand tall and strong. In a world of flash but empty stadiums, Leichhardt Oval, 89 years young, is still old-school cool. But the ground’s future remains in doubt without new funding for upgrades and the Inner West Mayor, Darcy Byrne, is among those calling for state and federal government contributions to “bring it up to standard” and help save a site steeped in history. It was at Leichhardt Oval on 27 April 1957 that TCN Channel Nine screened the first rugby league match shown on TV, a 12-10 win to the Tigers over Canterbury. In the 1970s, floodlights were installed here before the SCG, meaning Leichhardt hosted the interstate battles between New South Wales and Queensland in the old “state of residence” era before State of Origin. Then came the years the Tigers’ No 1 fan Laurie Nichols prowled the sidelines and concourses of Leichhardt Oval, shadowboxing phantoms in his Jackie Howe shearer’s singlet and reciting poetry (“Wayne Pearce, he’s so fierce”, “Beetso beats ‘em, then he eats ‘em”) and imploring fans to “give every inch of your heart” to the Tigers’ cause. A foundation club of the NSW rugby league, the Balmain Tigers claimed 11 premierships, five since the club made Leichhardt Oval their home in 1934. But in the seasons since the last title in 1969 – the “great grand final heist” hatched by local coach Leo Nosworthy (and shady gamblers from the Balmain underworld, allegedly) – there’s been far more black than gold for fans. But good times returned in 1999 when the Tigers hitched their wagon to the Western Suburbs Magpies – the club they defeated in their first premiership game in 1908 – to become Wests Tigers. And although Leichhardt Oval shared home ground status with Magpies HQ in Campbelltown and Tigerland had by then been gentrified, it remained the heartland. The oval has inspired many thrilling victories. Tigers games-record holder Chris Lawrence recalls “a packed hill in 2009 and a Benji Marshall pass to send me down the sideline for the winning try against Melbourne”, but 185-game teammate John Skandalis says “the atmosphere of playing in front of sold-out crowds at a ground so rich in history that has hosted so many legends is more memorable than any win”. Tigers favourite Pat Richards glows at a memory from 2005. “The sun was shining, the hill was packed with a crowd of 22,000-plus and the roar of the fans was incredible,” he says. “Robbie Farah scored a hat-trick. There really was – and is – no better place to play.” That 2005 season was the year Wests Tigers won a fairytale premiership with an unlikely band of heroes playing razzle-dazzle football with youthful exuberance. The DNA of 2005 was at Leichhardt Oval last Saturday night. Coach Tim Sheens returned for the 2023 season with premiership stars Benji Marshall and Robbie Farah as his proteges. After a 0-7 start – the worst in the club’s history – the experiment looked a dud until the Tigers shocked premiers Penrith in round nine. Now, three weeks on, they have returned to Leichhardt for the last time this year, to face North Queensland Cowboys. “We’ve beaten everyone here,” Sheens says the night before the match. “But we’ve been booed off too.” Every home game, as the Wangal sun sinks behind the Wayne Pearce scoreboard, Wests Tigers chief executive, Justin Pascoe, takes out his phone camera to capture the moment. “It’s one of the most spectacular sights in sport,” he says. “The hill, the light, the crowd. It’s what makes Leichhardt Oval awesome and unique and gives it mystique.” But Pascoe still wants $150m to upgrade it into “a fit-for-purpose modern facility”. Whether Tigers fans want change is another matter. In days of yore the “Balmain fair go” rule of street fighting meant a rival knocked down suffered no more punishment – but it isn’t enforced tonight. The Tigers cross the stripe with 11 tries, converting each one for a record 66-18 win – their highest-ever score – to keep scoreboard attendant Philip Costello busy. A rapturous crowd floats home from the oval Sheens calls “our grand old girl” and Byrne describes as “the eighth wonder of the world”, leaving a little black and gold dust in the air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/victoria-landlord-blacklist-dodgy-register-list-16-names","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:04:15Z","webTitle":"Victorian dodgy landlord register lists just 16 names after more than two years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/victoria-landlord-blacklist-dodgy-register-list-16-names","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/victoria-landlord-blacklist-dodgy-register-list-16-names","fields":{"headline":"Victorian dodgy landlord register lists just 16 names after more than two years","bodyText":"Victoria’s register of dodgy landlords has come under fire from advocates for only having 16 names on the list despite running for more than two years. In March 2021 the state government launched a database of rental providers who have broken an offence under the Tenancy Act, promising to even the playing field between renters and landlords. The real estate industry has long used secret “tenancy databases”, which are kept by private companies who charge a fee to agents to list tenants or look up their rental history. When the “landlord blacklist” was launched, the premier, Daniel Andrews, said it would help relieve the power imbalance, as private companies keep lists of tenants. “Landlords and agents have been keeping blacklists of tenants for years,” Andrews said. “So it’s only fair that we keep our own blacklist for dodgy landlords and agents. This way, both sides of the agreement can be accountable for their actions.” But the secretary of the Renters And Housing Union, Sean Budd, said having only 16 names on the list showed it wasn’t working. “Quite often, bad landlord behaviour just doesn’t even make it to Vcat,” Budd said. “There are reasons for that. [Firstly] the Vcat system is overwhelmed and secondly, most renters don’t uphold their rights – whether that’s because they’re fearful of retaliation like getting evicted, or they don’t know that they have those rights.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The rental non-compliance register displays the details of providers who have become the subject of a Vcat compliance or compensation order – with their details remaining on the register for three years. It does not stop landlords from continuing to rent out their properties. “What does a bad landlord list really do for renters?” Budd said. “The bad tenants list, for instance, prevents renters from getting a home. But most renters don’t even know who their landlord is, they’re probably not aware of their name.” Budd said if the government wanted a fairer playing field, the tenant list would also be managed by Consumer Affairs. Victorian Greens renters’ rights spokesperson, Gabrielle de Vietri, called on the government to “address the power imbalance between renters and landlords in Victoria”. “Renters often face sub-par rental standards and unfair rent hikes and evictions as a result of dodgy landlords,” de Vietri said. “And sadly the only way to put that landlord on notice is to enter a time-consuming and costly Vcat process.” But a spokesperson for the government defended the list, saying the 2021 changes, which the list was part of, made renting fairer. “We expect all landlords, agents and rental providers to follow the law – every person deserves a safe and secure roof over their head,” the spokesperson said. “We take breaches of the Residential Tenancies Act seriously and investigate and work with renters and rental providers where necessary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/may/22/dating-cons-and-dodgy-apps-among-most-common-scams-says-uk-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Dating cons and dodgy apps among most common scams, says UK watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/22/dating-cons-and-dodgy-apps-among-most-common-scams-says-uk-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/may/22/dating-cons-and-dodgy-apps-among-most-common-scams-says-uk-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Dating cons and dodgy apps among most common scams, says UK watchdog","bodyText":"Dating cons known as “pig butchering”, fake missing person appeals and dodgy apps are among the most widely used and convincing scams in circulation this year, according to Britain’s leading consumer watchdog. Pig butchering – so-called by fraudsters because they “fatten up” the victim by forming a romantic connection before executing the investment part of the scam – has been flagged by Which? magazine as one of the most pernicious scams. The scammer and victim typically meet on a dating site and when the victim is sufficiently groomed, the scammer claims they have been having success investing – typically in property or cryptocurrency – and they offer to invest some of the victim’s money. Which? has urged potential victims to look out for signs of “lovebombing”, attempts to move on to a private messaging platform, reluctance to meet in person and requests for money or a concerted effort to get the person to ‘invest’. Lisa Barber, the computing editor of Which?, said: “It’s appalling that 2023 has seen scammers continuing to thrive, as a new wave of convincing scams bombards consumers from every direction. The sad theme of all these scams is that tech platforms – whether social media, app stores or payment services – don’t always keep you safe.” She added: “Responsibility should not fall solely on the shoulders of consumers. Tech platforms and the government need to up their game and better prevent scammers reaching potential victims.” There has been a spate of viral fake posts in community pages worldwide about missing children or elderly people as well as malicious apps sneaking past screening processes and appearing in app stores, Which? added. With missing people, Which?’s researchers found near-identical posts in community pages all over the world, simply with the location changed. One appeal, found with a quick Facebook search for “Robert Spall dementia” will reveal the same post in pages for California, the US and Bogotá, Colombia. Last year, the online security firm Praedo discovered a so-called security app on Google Play. Calling itself 2FA Authenticator, it stole users’ banking information and had been installed more than 10,000 times before it was discovered. In 2022, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, found 400 Android and iOS apps stealing users’ Facebook login details. Another scam in circulation has become known as the PayPaul scam, Which? warns. This scam starts with people getting a “money request” from a genuine PayPal email address – service@paypal.com.

Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics revealed data from the 2021 census about the number of adults in England and Wales living with their parents: 4.9 million of them, up nearly 15% on the figure for 2011. The fact that the stats were collected in the midst of the Covid crisis may suggest a blip, but the ONS is adamant that the rise “appears to be a continuing trend rather than a result of the pandemic”. Ten years ago, it reported record levels of such living arrangements, and the latest numbers are even more striking. Men outnumber women by three to two. The share of 20- to 24-year-olds living in the family home is 51.2%, up from 44.5% 10 years ago, and for those aged 30 to 34, the figure is nearly 12%. Almost half of single-parent families now have adult children at home. In London, one in four households had at least one adult child in the home, and in five London boroughs, the average age of what the ONS calls “adult children living with their parents” is 26. The numbers in more rural places are often almost as remarkable: in Dorset, for example, that description applies to nearly 20% of the grownup population. Clearly, all this highlights the cruelties of our housing crisis. Woven into the same picture is a higher education system that spits out twentysomethings already burdened with astronomical debt. The result is a kind of compulsory extended adolescence, which is now threatening to envelop even those starting their 40s, and is surely a big part of the huge downturn in younger people’s mental health. It also has big potential repercussions for an already-blighted economy, not least when it comes to people’s ability to be as mobile as modern employers often demand. Over the past few weeks, housing has rightly moved into the political foreground. While the Conservatives squabble about their devotion to the green belt, Keir Starmer and his colleagues have been promising to restore the government’s binned targets for new homes, give first-time buyers priority on new houses built in their areas, and stop speculators based abroad from purchasing them. It has been good to hear him break one of politics’ most stupid taboos, and suggest that property prices need to fall in relation to people’s incomes. But a set of grimly familiar preferences and prejudices seem to sit under a lot of what he says, leaving millions of people unspoken for. When politicians talk about new housing, they usually mean the kind of developments that now ring most British towns and cities: three- or four-bedroom starter homes, with a car in the drive, and a slide and swing in the back garden. To state the obvious, there is nothing wrong with that: millions of us crave the certainty and security associated with home ownership, and the collective British mind tends to think that houses embody those things in a way that other kinds of homes do not. The archetypal swing voter, moreover, is likely to either own a house, or to want to – which only deepens Westminster’s attachment to an imagined utopia of cul-de-sacs and crescents, full of people happily mortgaged to the hilt. But where does that vision leave many of those people still living in the family home? What a lot of them need is housing that we never hear about: flats, suitable for single people, concentrated in and around towns and cities, and available for either reasonable prices – or, more urgently, genuinely affordable rents. An abundance of such places would not only help the young: it might also unblock a big chunk of the property market by attracting older couples and single people currently living in large dwellings, but prevented from moving by the unavailability of smaller properties. But who is building them? Last year, the property-selling platform Unlatch revealed that over the previous 12 months, one-bedroom flats had accounted for just 6% of new homes, and that new-builds had fallen by 12% since 2017. The only housing innovations offered to young people seem to be cramped “microflats” with shared kitchens and communal workspaces, which basically offer indefinite studenthood. Even for people who can afford to buy a proper apartment, life is often ruined by England and Wales’s awful leasehold system, which covers 95% of owner-occupied flats, and regularly combines its restricted definition of “ownership” with punitive service charges and fights over maintenance and repairs. Though the government will soon announce plans for reform, it recently abandoned plans to get rid of leaseholding; Labour says the system is “feudal”, but has only pledged to end it for new developments. All this highlights an even bigger issue: the fact that, even as economic precarity extends further and further up the age range, Westminster tends to view younger people as an afterthought. Whatever the arguments about how to finance higher education, one fact is clear: after Nick Clegg’s about-turn on tuition fees, Starmer is the second avowedly centrist politician in recent memory to have raised hopes of an end to huge student debt, and then dashed them. Thanks partly to the stupidities of our electoral system – and perhaps because youth-oriented politics are another Corbynite baby to be thrown out with the bathwater – his party’s main focus is on a segment of older people with rather different generational values. Labour definitely seems to take the under-30s for granted; meanwhile, as the political right’s failure to attract younger voters curdles into barely hidden loathing, it clings on to the absurd idea that far too many of them are spoiled snowflakes, whose problems supposedly amount to so much melodrama. There is a huge political opportunity here. The Green party would do well to present itself as champion of millennials and Gen Z, not only focused on the climate crisis and what it will mean for those people, but also keenly aware of the generational injustices that Labour and the Tories talk about selectively, at best. Younger voters would surely be receptive: they always strike me as a much more politicised lot than my generation, whose large-scale support for Labour may turn out to be rather more conditional than Starmer and his allies would like to think. At this rate, their patience will sooner or later snap, with no end of consequences. Politicians on all sides ought to think about that.

And when you go, maybe my afterlife, too, will come to an end, my afterlife of words.” So wrote Martin Amis in his heavily autobiographical final novel Inside Story in 2020. With a body of work spanning 50 years, he leaves 15 novels, two short-story collections, one memoir and seven book-length works of journalism and history. Did posterity matter to him? Hell, yes. “There is only one value judgment in literature: time,” he insisted. Back in 2009, I called Amis – as editors all over the world would have been calling or emailing leading writers on Saturday night – to ask if he might write a tribute to the American novelist John Updike, who had just died. Time was tight and we were aiming high, but as with every major (and not so major) event at that time, Amis was the writer everyone was after. And on Updike, the last postwar American literary giant? It had to be him. Happily, he felt a duty to contribute to what Gore Vidal called “book chat”. “Call me back in 10 minutes,” he said in his unmistakable transatlantic drawl (he hadn’t yet made America his permanent home). Had he said he would do it? Would he file in time for tomorrow’s front page? I wasn’t sure, but duly called him back 10 minutes later, hiding in a cupboard in the bowels of the Guardian, where we went to make private calls. “Ready?” he said. And – I may have imagined this bit – lighting a cigarette, he proceeded to dictate a whole piece, replete with semi-colons, quotation and his hallmark neologisms (not for Amis the correspondent’s punctuation-less cablese). He spoke and I typed. “There aren’t supposed to be extremes of uniqueness – either you are or you’re not – but he was exceptionally sui generis,” he drawled. We repeated the exercise barely three months later when another of his great heroes and friends, JG Ballard, died. This time we made it to over 1,000 words. “Very few Ballardians (who are almost all male) were foolish enough to emulate him. He was sui generis,” Amis enunciated with verbal italics. “What was influential, though, was the marvellous creaminess of his prose, and the weird and sudden expansions of his imagery,” he continued. “Marvellous creaminess”, “weird and sudden expansions” – how did he do that? OK, so he had written at length about both Updike and Ballard before. And he was routinely invoked as a successor to both. But still. Of all the writers I’d worked with during many years as a literary editor, Amis was the only one I knew who could pull that off. The sheer smarts and chutzpah of composing a piece off the cuff, without even going to the bother of turning on the computer, was quintessential Amis. He will for ever be remembered as part of the “Class of 83”, the inaugural Granta Best of Young British novelists list that also included Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, Salman Rushdie and Kazuo Ishiguro. “He has had a baleful influence on a whole generation,” bemoaned AS Byatt of Amis in 1993, as one of the Granta judges tasked with finding successors a decade later. Not because he was a bad writer but because so many had been foolish enough to try to emulate him (to echo Amis on Ballard). If, as is often said, this generation of writers were the closest the books world gets to having rock stars, then Amis was Mick Jagger. Those 70s photographs (The Rachel Papers years) of him pouting extravagantly at the camera, cigarette dangling – you can almost smell the smoke and ambition – announced a changing of the guard. His pose, like his prose, poised somewhere between provocation and seduction. Where the literary world had been grey and tweedy, presided over by ageing grandees (Amis Sr, William Golding, Anthony Burgess, Iris Murdoch), now it was young and outrageously brash, and Amis was the frontman. At an event in 2020 with Salman Rushdie, Rushdie asked him if, back in those heady days, he felt part of a gang. “That’s the way ‘movements’ start,” Amis replied. “Ambitious young drunks, late at night, saying, ‘We’re not going to do that any more. We’re going to do this instead.’” And with this “gang” – which also included his great friend, the late journalist Christopher Hitchens, and Ian McEwan – the young drunks went on to became “the old devils”, to borrow a Kingsley Amis title, that pretty much comprised the literary establishment for years. “There was a feeling,” he said of this time, “that there were places to go that the English novel didn’t go, and was being too fastidious about.” And he spent the next few decades making sure he was the first to go there. Who but Amis could have had such a firm grasp on the collar of what John Self, the narrator of Money, called “the panting present” to have written a novel of that title at the beginning of the 80s, that decade of Thatcherite greed? And then envisage ecological collapse in London Fields at the end of it? Which writer would have dared to take on the Holocaust (Time’s Arrow in 1991, and The Zone of Interest in 2014) and Stalin’s Great Terror (Koba the Dread in 2002), with, as Tim Adams put it in the Observer, “his full ironist’s swagger”? Or to have imagined the last 24 hours of 9/11 terrorist Mohamed Atta in The Second Plane in 2008? In his crusade for fine writing and his declaration of war on cliche, Amis made everyone up their game. Over the years, critics have fallen over themselves trying to outsmart Mart: lobbing hyperbole and volleying adverbs (Amis was a huge tennis fan). “So just how good is Martin Amis?” “Why do we love to hate Amis?” they would come out, strutting, pistols cocked. But Amis was already in the bar. For a time, he seemed happy to fill the role of novelist as public intellectual. He riffed elegantly on everything from the porn industry to the Royal family. “He is always putting it up to you somehow, making the reader feel brilliant too. Or a bit stupid,” wrote Anne Enright of his collection of criticism The Rub of Time in 2017. “This is the best fun going when everyone is drunk, as they seemed to be in the 1980s, and literary London was like one long dinner party in which everyone knew where you went to school.” Inevitably, the poster-boy turned into a target, and at one point Amis the dazzling young stylist looked in danger of being overshadowed by Amis the grumpy old controversialist, with ill-judged comments on Islamism and euthanasia. But after what he called an “eisteddfod of hostility” from the British press and his move to New York, he largely reserved his opinions for his writing. He was planning a collection of short stories on the subject of slavery in the US – “boy will I cop it,” he said in a recent Guardian interview – as well as returning to the Third Reich for a third time with a “modest novella”. And yet, despite many years as Britain’s foremost literary celebrity and contrarian, Amis somehow managed never to win the Booker (he was only shortlisted for Time’s Arrow) nor to be cancelled. Of his instinct to shock, he observed: “Every novel worth reading is funny and serious. Anyone who’s any good is going to be funny. It’s the nature of life. Life is funny.” And it is clear from the irrepressible punchiness of his prose that he had a blast writing. “It seems to me a hilariously enjoyable way of spending one’s time,” he said. And so, at his daring comic best, he was great fun to read. The insolence, the silliness, the seriousness, the grotesqueness, the erudition and audacity were all swept up in those inimitable sentences and corralled into order by his cleverness with form. As Enright summed up in her review: “Damn, that fool can write.” And, like an imposing building slightly worn with time, Amis changed the landscape of literature so dramatically that it is hard to remember what it looked like before. And for all the macho-ness of his writing, his influence can be seen in writers of the generation that followed, for instance his friend Zadie Smith. “He was a talismanic figure for my generation of novelists, and an inspiration to me personally,” says another friend, Kazuo Ishiguro. “He was famous, notorious even, for his biting satire and swaggering prose, but there was always a surprising tenderness not far beneath that surface. His characters were always yearning for love and connection. I believe ultimately his work will age well, growing over the years.” We will be reading him for decades, weather permitting. But to go back to 2009 and Amis’s closing words on Updike: “His style was one of compulsive and unstoppable vividness and musicality. Several times a day you turn to him, as you will now to his ghost, and say to yourself, ‘How would Updike have done it?’ This is a very cold day for literature.” And so it is today. Younger writers will ask: “How would Amis have done it?” He was exceptionally sui generis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/may/22/university-investment-funds-urge-stop-new-fossil-fuel-projects-shell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"University investment funds urge ‘bold action’ to stop new fossil fuel projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/22/university-investment-funds-urge-stop-new-fossil-fuel-projects-shell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/22/university-investment-funds-urge-stop-new-fossil-fuel-projects-shell","fields":{"headline":"University investment funds urge ‘bold action’ to stop new fossil fuel projects","bodyText":"A coalition of university investment funds has called on institutional investors to rebel against the boards of fossil fuel companies and their backers. As Shell prepares for its annual shareholder meeting this week, representatives from the Universities of Newcastle, Sussex, Bristol and from Trinity College, Cambridge, have written an open letter to the asset management industry urging “bold action” to stop new fossil fuel projects. The letter, seen by the Guardian, asks asset managers to vote against directors of companies pursuing or backing new projects. It also asks investors to support all climate-linked shareholder resolutions, particularly those that call for an end to new fossil fuel projects. A spokesperson for the University of Sussex said: “Our academics have identified new fossil fuel projects as a key threat to meeting critical global climate targets, including limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. Asset managers, who hold trillions in investments on behalf of their clients, have a key role to play in stewarding the world’s economy away from fossil fuels.” The latest call for a revolt against the fossil fuel industry has emerged as Shell braces for what is expected to be one of its most hostile annual meetings in London after fierce climate protests in recent weeks that have disrupted the AGMs held by BP, Barclays and Drax. Leading investment funds, proxy advisers and activist shareholders are preparing to take Shell to task for failing to outline a business strategy that aligns with the Paris climate agreement. The company’s chair, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, will face calls to be ousted from the board by the Church of England Pensions Board, Britain’s Local Authorities Pension Funds Forum and the UK’s biggest workplace pensions manager, Nest. Shareholder advisers at PIRC and USS have also recommended that shareholders vote against the reappointment of Mackenzie, or other board members, to protest against what they view as insufficient progress on the energy transition. The same funds have also backed an activist shareholder resolution from the Dutch climate campaign group Follow This, which is calling for oil companies to set a strategy that aligns with the goal of limiting global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels enshrined in the Paris climate agreement. For the first time, Follow This has won the support of investors that are leading the world’s largest climate-focused investor group Climate Action 100+ in its engagement with Shell. The Dutch funds PGGM and MN are expected to call on the investors within the Climate Action 100+, which represents $68tn (£54.6tn) in assets, to vote in favour of the resolution. The Follow This campaign has been emboldened by concerns among ethical investors that the oil giant may be preparing to water down its commitments to reduce fossil fuel production in order to take advantage of soaring global energy prices. A spokesperson for Shell said the company strongly disagreed with the Follow This resolution and with those organisations that had recommended supporting it. The company said there should be an emphasis on “changing the use of energy as much as its supply, and this is reflected in our approach”. The spokesperson said: “We trust a vast majority of shareholders will agree on the need to collaborate in balancing the supply and use of energy to accelerate the energy transition, while reducing the social costs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/there-was-all-sorts-of-toxic-behaviour-timnit-gebru-on-her-sacking-by-google-ais-dangers-and-big-techs-biases","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘There was all sorts of toxic behaviour’: Timnit Gebru on her sacking by Google, AI’s dangers and big tech’s biases ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/there-was-all-sorts-of-toxic-behaviour-timnit-gebru-on-her-sacking-by-google-ais-dangers-and-big-techs-biases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/there-was-all-sorts-of-toxic-behaviour-timnit-gebru-on-her-sacking-by-google-ais-dangers-and-big-techs-biases","fields":{"headline":"‘There was all sorts of toxic behaviour’: Timnit Gebru on her sacking by Google, AI’s dangers and big tech’s biases ","bodyText":"‘It feels like a gold rush,” says Timnit Gebru. “In fact, it is a gold rush. And a lot of the people who are making money are not the people actually in the midst of it. But it’s humans who decide whether all this should be done or not. We should remember that we have the agency to do that.” Gebru is talking about her specialised field: artificial intelligence. On the day we speak via a video call, she is in Kigali, Rwanda, preparing to host a workshop and chair a panel at an international conference on AI. It will address the huge growth in AI’s capabilities, as well as something that the frenzied conversation about AI misses out: the fact that many of its systems may well be built on a huge mess of biases, inequalities and imbalances of power. This gathering, the clunkily titled International Conference on Learning Representations, marks the first time people in the field have come together in an African country – which makes a powerful point about big tech’s neglect of the global south. When Gebru talks about the way that AI “impacts people all over the world and they don’t get to have a say on how they should shape it”, the issue is thrown into even sharper relief by her backstory. In her teens, Gebru was a refugee from the war between Ethiopia, where she grew up, and Eritrea, where her parents were born. After a year in Ireland, she made it to the outskirts of Boston, Massachusetts, and from there to Stanford University in northern California, which opened the way to a career at the cutting edge of the computing industry: Apple, then Microsoft, followed by Google. But in late 2020, her work at Google came to a sudden end. As the co-leader of Google’s small ethical AI team, Gebru was one of the authors of an academic paper that warned about the kind of AI that is increasingly built into our lives, taking internet searches and user recommendations to apparently new levels of sophistication and threatening to master such human talents as writing, composing music and analysing images. The clear danger, the paper said, is that such supposed “intelligence” is based on huge data sets that “overrepresent hegemonic viewpoints and encode biases potentially damaging to marginalised populations”. Put more bluntly, AI threatens to deepen the dominance of a way of thinking that is white, male, comparatively affluent and focused on the US and Europe. In response, senior managers at Google demanded that Gebru either withdraw the paper, or take her name and those of her colleagues off it. This triggered a run of events that led to her departure. Google says she resigned; Gebru insists that she was fired. What all this told her, she says, is that big tech is consumed by a drive to develop AI and “you don’t want someone like me who’s going to get in your way. I think it made it really clear that unless there is external pressure to do something different, companies are not just going to self-regulate. We need regulation and we need something better than just a profit motive.” Gebru, who is 40, sometimes speaks dizzyingly quickly, as if the rich details of her life might outrun the hour or so we have to talk. She tends to use the precise, measured vocabulary of a tech insider, leavened with a sense of the absurd that is focused on one particularly howling irony: the fact that an industry brimming with people who espouse liberal, self-consciously progressive opinions so often seems to push the world in the opposite direction. One of the subjects she returns to repeatedly is racism, including experiences of prejudice in the US education system and Silicon Valley. While she was at high school in Massachusetts, she says, her gift for science was treated bluntly (one teacher said: “I’ve met so many people like you who think that they can just come here from other countries and take the hardest classes”) and passive-aggressively: despite high grades in physics, her request to study the subject further was met with concerns that she might find it too difficult. “The thing that was very confusing to me as an immigrant was that liberal type of racism,” she says. “People who sound like they really care about you, but they’d be like: ‘Don’t you think it’s going to be hard for you?’ It took me a while to really figure out what was going on.” Later on came a watershed experience of even more brazen prejudice, when she and a friend – a black woman – were attacked in a bar. “That was the scariest encounter I’ve ever had in the US,” she says. “It was in San Francisco – again, another liberal place. I was being attacked by a bunch of guys and nobody helped me at all. That was the scariest thing to see: being strangled and people just walking by and looking at you.” She called the police. “And that was worse than not calling them, because first they accused me of lying a number of times, and kept on telling me to calm down. And then they put handcuffs on my friend, who had just been attacked.” Her friend was also detained in a police cell. At Stanford, although she was often condescendingly asked by some of her white peers if she had got in thanks to an affirmative action programme, her undergraduate years were spent in an environment where senior people at least “talked about diversity a lot, and they had different people from different places”. But after working as an audio engineer for Apple between 2005 and 2007, she went back to Stanford to study for a PhD and had very different experiences. Her life, she says, became all about “going to an office every day with the same bunch of people – it’s kind of like work. And there was nobody who looked like me at all. It was just shocking.” Gebru began to specialise in cutting-edge AI, pioneering a system that showed how data about particular neighbourhoods’ patterns of car ownership highlighted differences bound up with ethnicity, crime figures, voting behaviour and income levels. In retrospect, this kind of work might look like the bedrock of techniques that could blur into automated surveillance and law enforcement, but Gebru admits that “none of those bells went off in my head … that connection of issues of technology with diversity and oppression came later”. Soon enough, though, she began to think deeply about how big tech’s innovations often embodied the same inequalities evident in its offices, labs and social activities. In 2015, Google had to apologise when the AI systems that served its Photos app mistakenly identified a black couple as gorillas. The year after, the thinktank ProPublica found that software used across the US to assess prison convicts’ chances of reoffending was heavily biased against black people. Meanwhile, Gebru was becoming even more aware of aspects of the tech industry’s culture that lay behind such stories. Around this time, she attended a big AI conference in Montreal where, at a Google party, a group of white men openly harassed her. “One of them kissed me, one of them took a picture. And I was kind of frozen: I didn’t really do anything. They were having a party at an academic conference with limitless drinks at a bar and they weren’t even making it clear that this was a professional event. Obviously, you should never harass women – or anybody – like that. But that was rampant at these conferences.” The organisers of the conference say that their code of conduct has since been “elaborated”; they now have “a new one-stop contact point for concerns and complaints, which is monitored closely”. The next year, Gebru made a point of counting other black attenders at the same event. She found that, among 8,500 delegates, there were only six people of colour. In response, she put up a Facebook post that now seems prescient: “I’m not worried about machines taking over the world; I’m worried about groupthink, insularity and arrogance in the AI community.” In that context, it might seem surprising that, after a year spent working in Microsoft’s fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics in AI lab, Gebru took a job at Google. In 2018, thanks to Margaret Mitchell, a recently hired specialist in algorithmic bias, she was recruited to co-lead a team dedicated to the ethics of AI. “I was full of trepidation,” she says. “But I thought: ‘Well, Margaret Mitchell is here – we can work together. Who else can I work with?’ But that was how I went into it: I was like: ‘I wonder how long I can last here.’” “It was a difficult decision,” she says. “Because, by the time I was going to Google, I had heard from several women about sexual harassment, and other kinds of harassment, and they had actually said: ‘Don’t do it.’” When Gebru arrived, Google employees were loudly opposing the company’s role in Project Maven, which used AI to analyse surveillance footage captured by military drones (Google ended its involvement in 2018). Two months later, staff took part in a huge walkout over claims of systemic racism, sexual harassment and gender inequality. Gebru says she was aware of “a lot of tolerance of harassment and all sorts of toxic behaviour”. In its quest to highlight some of the moral and political questions surrounding AI, her team hired Google’s first social scientist. She and her colleagues prided themselves on how diverse their small operation was, as well as the things they brought to the company’s attention, which included issues to do with Google’s ownership of YouTube. A colleague from Morocco raised the alarm about a popular YouTube channel in that country called Chouf TV, “which was basically operated by the government’s intelligence arm and they were using it to harass journalists and dissidents. YouTube had done nothing about it.” (Google says that it “would need to review the content to understand whether it violates our policies. But, in general, our harassment policies strictly prohibit content that threatens individuals, targets someone with prolonged or malicious insults based on intrinsic attributes, or reveals someone’s personally identifiable information.”) Then, in 2020, Gebru, Mitchell and two colleagues wrote the paper that would lead to Gebru’s departure. It was titled On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots. Its key contention was about AI centred on so-called large language models: the kind of systems – such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s newly launched PaLM 2 – that, crudely speaking, feast on vast amounts of data to perform sophisticated tasks and generate content. These sources are usually scraped from the world wide web and inevitably include material usually subject to copyright (if an AI system can produce prose in the style of a particular writer, for example, that is because it has absorbed much of the writer’s work). But Gebru and her co-authors had an even graver concern: that trawling the online world risks reproducing its worst aspects, from hate speech to points of view that exclude marginalised people and places. “In accepting large amounts of web text as ‘representative’ of ‘all’ of humanity, we risk perpetuating dominant viewpoints, increasing power imbalances and further reifying inequality,” they wrote. When the paper was submitted for internal review, Gebru was contacted by one of Google’s vice-presidents. At first, she says, non-specific objections were expressed, such as that she and her colleagues had been too “negative” about AI. Then, Google asked Gebru either to withdraw the paper, or remove her and her colleagues’ names from it. She says she told the company that she would not retract it and would remove the authors’ names only if Google specified its objections. If this didn’t happen, she said, she would resign. She also sent a number of emails to women working in Google’s AI division, saying that the company was “silencing marginalised voices”. Then, in December 2020, while she was on holiday, one of her closest colleagues texted her to ask if an email they had seen saying she had left the company was correct. Subsequent accounts said that Google had cited “behaviour that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager”. How, I wonder, did she feel? “I was not in thinking mode. I was just in action mode, like: ‘I need a lawyer and I need to get my story out; I wonder what they’re planning; I wonder what they’re going to say about me.’” She pauses. “But I was fired. In the middle of my vacation, on a road trip to visit my mom, in the middle of a pandemic.” In response to what Gebru says about workplace harassment and toxic behaviour at Google, her experiences at the party in Montreal and the nature of her departure, the company’s press office emails me a set of “background points”. “We are committed to building a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace – and we take misconduct very seriously,” it says. “We have strict policies against harassment and discrimination, thoroughly investigate all concerns reported and take firm actions against substantiated allegations. We also have several ways for our workforce to report concerns, including anonymously.” Five years ago, it goes on, the company overhauled “the way we handle and investigate employee concerns, introducing new care programs for employees who report concerns and making arbitration optional for Google employees”. On questions about AI systems using copyrighted material, a spokesperson says that Google will “innovate in this space responsibly, ethically, and legally”, and plans to “continue our collaboration and discussions with publishers and the ecosystem to find ways for this new technology to help enhance their work and benefit the entire web ecosystem”. After her departure, Gebru founded Dair, the Distributed AI Research Institute, to which she now devotes her working time. “We have people in the US and the EU, and in Africa,” she says. “We have social scientists, computer scientists, engineers, refugee advocates, labour organisers, activists … it’s a mix of people.” The institute’s fellows, she tells me, include a former Amazon delivery driver, plus people with experience of the monotonous and sometimes traumatic job of manually labelling online content – including illegal and toxic material – to train AI systems. Much of this work happens in developing countries. “There’s a lot of exploitation in the field of AI, and we want to make that visible so that people know what’s wrong,” she says. “But also, AI is not magic. There are a lot of people involved – humans.” Running alongside this is a quest to push beyond the tendency of the tech industry and the media to focus attention on worries about AI taking over the planet and wiping out humanity while questions about what the technology does, and who it benefits and damages, remain unheard. “That conversation ascribes agency to a tool rather than the humans building the tool,” she says. “That means you can aggregate responsibility: ‘It’s not me that’s the problem. It’s the tool. It’s super-powerful. We don’t know what it’s going to do.’ Well, no – it’s you that’s the problem. You’re building something with certain characteristics for your profit. That’s extremely distracting, and it takes the attention away from real harms and things that we need to do. Right now.” How does she feel squaring up to her old employers in Silicon Valley? “I don’t know if we’ll change them or not,” she says. “We’re never going to get, like, a quadrillion dollars to do what we’re doing. I just feel like we have to do what we can. Maybe, if enough people do small things and get organised, things will change. That’s my hope.” • Join a Guardian Live online event on the future of AI on Tuesday 23 May at 8pm, chaired by technology editor Alex Hern.

That’s how the warden of his Leicester almshouse knows he’s up and about – that he hasn’t had a fall or become ill overnight. “It’s just one example of how everything is thought of here: nothing is left to chance: everyone is safe at every moment of the day,” said the 71-year-old former department store manager. “I have absolutely no worries at all here. I’m completely content.” Hiercock has lived in the Wyggestons Almshouses in Leicester for just over a year, since his partner of 53 years had to go into a care home with advanced Alzheimer’s. “I start every day feeling happy and grateful to be here,” he said. “I was very isolated where I lived before but here, everyone is so friendly. If I’m ever feeling a bit lonely, I just need to go for a stroll and I’ll come across someone to do something with.” Almshouses are the oldest form of social housing in the world: the oldest foundation still in existence dates from about 990. Legally, historically and socially unique – exempt from right to buy legislation and so remaining as a permanent part of the community once gifted – there are 30,000 throughout the UK, providing affordable housing for more than 36,000 residents. They are owned and managed by a network of more than 1,600 independent charities, and nearly all market towns in the UK have at least one almshouse. In some rural areas, they are the only provider of affordable, community housing. In a time of a severe shortage of affordable rental accommodation, almshouse charities have long been trying to get attention from philanthropists and the government to make the case that their role is more vital than ever – that they should be put at the forefront of the community housing concept, providing an “exemplar housing model”. Now, a new research project, the Almshouse Longevity Study from Bayes business school, has given extra ammunition to their call finding that those fortunate enough to live in an almshouse receive a longevity boost of almost two and a half years – equating to an extra 15% of future life for someone aged in their early 70s. Despite not looming large in the public’s awareness, more almshouses are being built today than have been since the Victorian era; while most are for elderly people, some have no age restrictions and are able to accommodate families, people with disabilities and key workers. Kim Baxter is about to move into a new almshouse in south London while her old one is refurbished. “My husband currently has to sleep in a chair because he’s got such severe leg disabilities,” said the 68-year-old. “This new flat is adapted for someone with his disabilities. Our lives have been so restricted for so long that this is going to give us both a new lease of life.” Baxter moved into her first almshouse five years ago. “We were not in a good way,” she said. “We were stressed because my husband’s disabilities meant debt was piling up. Had we not been able to move into an almshouse, where everything is affordable and stress free, I don’t think we’d be here today, I really don’t.” Charlie said that he too would probably not be here today had his local almshouse not taken him in. When his partner died a few years ago, the 77-year-old found himself grieving, depressed, facing homeless, without funds or family support. “The local authority said they couldn’t house me. I was facing God knows what future. No future at all, probably,” he said. “But now I’m looked after in every way, with neighbours and a community that is always there for me,” he said. “It’s transformed my life. I feel like I’ve got a big, protective family around me. It was the perfect rescue.” Up to 12% of rough sleepers are estimated to be over 55 years old. In 2018, the latest figures available, there were 2,500 people aged over 60 who were officially homeless – double the number in 2009. In 2017, the Local Government Association warned that the scale of existing elderly homelessness was set to double by 2025. But, say experts, it is not just the older population who could benefit from the almshouse model being adopted more widely. Nick Phillips, the chief executive of the Almshouse Association, is calling for today’s philanthropists to set up almshouses for the various groups suffering from the housing crisis. “The model would work brilliantly for young families, young people, for those coming out of the care system and for refugees,” he said. Paul Mullis, the chief executive of the Durham Aged Mineworkers’ Homes Association, the biggest almshouse charity in the UK, agreed. “Our residents know they can look forward to tomorrow because the things that make people’s lives worth living haven’t changed in the 1,000 years that almshouses were created to target: community, safe and secure housing, a sense of purpose.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/the-hole-truth-scientists-solve-mystery-of-pogo-stick-seabed-tunnels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"The hole truth: scientists solve mystery of ‘pogo-stick’ seabed tunnels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/the-hole-truth-scientists-solve-mystery-of-pogo-stick-seabed-tunnels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/the-hole-truth-scientists-solve-mystery-of-pogo-stick-seabed-tunnels","fields":{"headline":"The hole truth: scientists solve mystery of ‘pogo-stick’ seabed tunnels","bodyText":"During an expedition in the cold waters of the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska, last summer, a team of scientists spotted neat lines of holes poked into the seafloor. But they did not know who – or what – had created them. Scientists on the German research vessel Sonne set about hunting for clues. They sifted through several hundred images captured by a camera towed above the seafloor. The pictures revealed distinctive rows oval-shaped holes, each measuring roughly two or three centimetres – as if something had pogo-sticked a short way over the seabed. But the mystery remained – until now. The discovery happened by chance. Various animals were spied nearby and became suspects. “Most things were pretty easy to exclude,” says Julia Sigwart from the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. The holes were too small for sea urchins to fit into, and the wrong shape to be worm burrows. Then one of the team, Angelika Brandt, also from the Senckenberg Museum, noticed something: a little crustacean. “Angelika jumps up, she points at the screen and says: ‘It’s that! That’s the maker!’ and then she ran out of the room,” says Sigwart. A few moments later, Brandt returned with an external computer hard drive and showed everyone a video that had been shot 40 years earlier by a colleague. It was an amphipod – a relative of beach-dwelling sand hoppers – from Antarctica, filmed in captivity busily digging a burrow in the sand in its aquarium. Using its huge front appendages, it was carefully shovelling sand out of a hole and heaping it in a neat pile without letting it slide back in. The Antarctic amphipod looked a lot like the one Brandt spotted in the Bering Sea. “When I saw the animal sitting in that hole, it was really a deja vu moment,” she says. The Bering Sea amphipods have yet to be caught making the holes, but Brandt and colleagues think they are probably eating sediment in nutrient-rich layers of the seabed, and digging tunnels as they go. If they are anything like their Antarctic cousins, these 2cm-long crustaceans could also be using the burrows to breed. Female amphipods have pouches in which they raise their young. After they are born, the larvae don’t float away like the offspring of many sea creatures do, but can stay in their parents’ burrows for weeks or even months. “Having a burrow is a way to access food, get protection from potential predators and it’s a safe place to raise your kids,” says Sigwart. The burrows matter not just for the amphipods themselves, but also because they create niches for other species and are probably important for biodiversity on abyssal plains. “Most animals in the deep sea are very small – maybe a millimetre in size,” says Sigwart. At that scale, a 30cm-long burrow is a mountain. “If you’re tiny, then even small changes in topography would have a massive impact on your habitat and how you interact with your environment,” she says. The discovery has given scientists hope that they might make progress deciphering the many other mysterious marks in the mud at the bottom of the ocean. “It’s amazing how much activity there is in and on the seafloor. It’s just full of traces and holes,” says Sigwart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/may/22/ai-ready-meal-packaging-and-the-uk-scrapping-eu-laws-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"AI, ready-meal packaging and the UK scrapping EU laws: Edith Pritchett’s week in Venn diagrams – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/may/22/ai-ready-meal-packaging-and-the-uk-scrapping-eu-laws-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/may/22/ai-ready-meal-packaging-and-the-uk-scrapping-eu-laws-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"AI, ready-meal packaging and the UK scrapping EU laws: Edith Pritchett’s week in Venn diagrams – cartoon","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/almshouse-residents-may-live-up-to-two-and-a-half-years-longer-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"Almshouse residents may live up to two and a half years longer, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/almshouse-residents-may-live-up-to-two-and-a-half-years-longer-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/almshouse-residents-may-live-up-to-two-and-a-half-years-longer-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Almshouse residents may live up to two and a half years longer, study finds","bodyText":"Poor, older people living in almshouses enjoy longer lives than far wealthier people living elsewhere, a study has found. The secret to longer life has been intensely sought after for centuries. But research using data from almshouses going back 100 years has found that the solution devised in early medieval times to help poverty-stricken knights returning from the Crusades is still relevant today. The report from the Bayes Business School says the longevity of those who move into one of the UK’s 30,000 almshouses – the oldest form of social housing – is boosted by as much as two and a half years. Given that residents typically move into almshouses in their early 70s, this is equivalent to an extra 15% of future life. “Almshouses seem to wipe away the negative impacts on health and social wellbeing commonly experienced by older people in lower socioeconomic groups, particularly those living in isolation,” said Ben Rickayzen, a professor of actuarial science at Bayes and co-author of the Almshouse Longevity Study. Almshouses are a charitable form of self-sufficient, low-cost community housing held in trust for local people in housing need. They are managed and run by almshouse charities made up of local volunteers. Residents pay rent, usually called a maintenance contribution, which is often less than the average rent in local properties rented from a council, housing association or private landlord. The best-performing almshouses in the study, Charterhouse and Morden College, bestowed a longevity boost on residents equivalent to that enjoyed by those in the second highest socioeconomic quintile. It was a remarkable outcome, said Rickayzen, equating to a 73-year-old man receiving a longevity boost of 2.4 years – an extra 15% of future lifetime – compared with his peers from the same socioeconomic group, and 0.7 years when compared with an average 73-year-old from the general population. “It is well known that the lower a person’s socioeconomic status, the lower their life expectancy. But our research has found that this doesn’t have to be the case,” he said. “We found that residents can expect to live as long as wealthier members of the general population despite coming from the most deprived quintile.” Rickayzen said the study, which was sponsored by the Dunhill Medical Trust and the Justham Trust, and supported by the Almshouse Association, proved that this ancient form of housing still addressed the evolving needs of older people living in modern-day society. Almshouses usually encourage residents to take part in social activities and have responsibilities for fellow residents, increasing their sense of belonging, giving them a greater sense of purpose and reducing isolation. Alison Benzimra, a co-author of the report and the head of research at United St Saviour’s Charity, said the findings could help the government with its aim to reduce inequalities in mortality and provide a solution to the UK’s social care problems. “This is an opportunity to improve the government’s levelling up agenda by incorporating the best features of communal living into their social housing policy,” she said. “It is important that levelling up should aim to combat health inequalities experienced by people from lower socioeconomic groups across the country.” Nick Phillips, the chief executive of the Almshouse Association, said the findings could be replicated across all sections of society currently experiencing housing crises. “The almshouse model is perfect not just for poorer, older people but young families, young people struggling to afford their first home and refugees,” he said. “It’s the housing model of the past but perfectly adaptable to the housing crises of not just today but the future too. We just need philanthropists to set up more of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/china-summons-japanese-ambassador-over-smears-at-g7-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T04:50:27Z","webTitle":"China hits back at G7 nations, accusing them of ‘smears’ and ‘slander’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/china-summons-japanese-ambassador-over-smears-at-g7-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/china-summons-japanese-ambassador-over-smears-at-g7-summit","fields":{"headline":"China hits back at G7 nations, accusing them of ‘smears’ and ‘slander’","bodyText":"Beijing has accused the G7 nations of collaborating to “smear and attack” China, after the weekend summit issued a communique that warned Beijing over its “militarisation activities” in the Asia-Pacific region. After the summit, China summoned the Japanese ambassador to register an official protest, and warned the UK to stop “slandering” the country to avoid further damage to bilateral relations. Chinese regulators also chose the weekend to announce that US chip firm, Micron Technology, had failed a security review and would be banned from use in Chinese critical infrastructure. The G7 communique, issued on Saturday, stated that it wanted “constructive and stable relations” with Beijing, referring to “de-risking” rather than “de-coupling” from their relationship with China amid warnings from France that the summit should not be seen as being anti-Beijing. But it also outlined key concerns over militarisation in the East and South China Seas, China’s intentions towards Taiwan, and human rights concerns in Xinjiang and Tibet. The leaders of the Quad group – Australia, India, Japan and the US – also delivered a thinly veiled criticism of Beijing, calling for “peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific maritime domain”. “We strongly oppose destabilising or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” the statement said, using diplomatic language that appeared to refer to China’s economic tactics to gain leverage over poorer countries and also its military expansion in the Pacific. In response, China’s ministry of foreign affairs on Saturday accused the G7 of “hindering international peace, undermining regional stability and curbing other countries’ development”. On Monday China’s deputy foreign minister, Sun Weidong, summoned the Japanese ambassador to register an official protest over what the ministry called the “hype around China-related issues” at the summit.Sun claimed Japan had collaborated with other countries at the summit through “activities and joint declarations … to smear and attack China, grossly interfering in China’s internal affairs”. He said Japan’s actions were detrimental to China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and that China is “strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes” them. “Japan should correct its understanding of China, grasp strategic autonomy … and truly promote the stable development of bilateral relations with a constructive attitude,” Sun said. Japanese officials said their country’s position on China had been consistent, while Hideo Tarumi, the Japanese ambassador to China, said the G7 would continue to refer to issues of common concern as long as China does not change its behaviour, according to a statement. “China should first take positive steps to address those issues of concerns if China demands not to refer to them,” Tarumi is said to have told Sun. On Sunday, the Chinese embassy in Britain hit back at comments by UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, saying China represented the world’s greatest challenge to security and prosperity, but that other leading economies should not decouple from it. The embassy statement asked the UK government to stop slandering and smearing China to avoid further damage to China-UK relations. “The relevant remarks by the British side are simply parroting words from others and constitute malicious slanders in disregard of the facts. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this,” it said. Also on Sunday, Chinese regulators announced US chip maker, Micron Technology, had failed a two month security review, and Chinese critical infrastructure would be barred from using it. Although Micron’s market share in China is small, the timing of the announcement during G7 was important, said Christopher Miller, a professor at Tufts University. Miller said the Micron ban could be the first test of the “de-risking” strategy. The G7 leaders had also agreed to establish an initiative to counter economic “coercion.” “This case could be an early test of the G7’s efforts on this front,” Miller said. Beijing’s pushback on the summit also continued to play out across state media. The official news outlet Xinhua reported that the G7 “covered many topics but unfortunately ended with a focus on interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and hindering their development”. It said the communique “unwarrantedly depicting the country as a trouble-maker”, and that it and other documents “hype up China threats, [and] make a truce out of reach regarding Ukraine crisis”. Despite the anger from Beijing, US president Joe Biden told reporters on Sunday he expects there to soon be improvements in the US-China relationship. “In terms of talking with them, I think you’re going to see that thaw very shortly,” Biden said. US-China relations have soured in recent years, and recent attempts to get them back on track were derailed in February, when the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon it detected flying in US airspace.

Otherwise, it showed little of what to expect from the Gwenffrwd-Dinas RSPB reserve. This 600 hectares of Atlantic oak woodland, glorious though it is, is a mere remnant of what once was a much larger Celtic temperate rainforest, covering most of the west coast of Britain. This kind of habitat is increasingly rare, and indeed it feels aptly precious. Water is monarch here, sustained by westerly Atlantic storms. Rains decant through tree canopies, and creep into cracks and crevices in gnarled sessile oak boughs, while moss cushions trap and retain the water, maintaining forest humidity. Epiphytic ferns cling to oak branches like arboreal hitch-hikers. Mosses not only pave the forest floor, but also creep up fence posts and drape over fallen stones. We followed a boardwalk into the woodland. Green was resurgent, the palette of spring, a mosaic of emerald, olive and sage. Tissue-paper thin leaves, emerging under spring warmth, imposed a gentle, verdant light. If the boardwalk wasn’t a clue enough to marshy ground below, a leafy profusion of hemlock water-dropwort, a few alder and glimpses of dark peaty soil confirmed that water lingers here. The boardwalk merged into a footpath. Among increasing cover of willow, downy birch and oak, we caught sight of a monochrome flicker: a male pied flycatcher, with a female perched close by. A male common redstart, its tail flashing like fire, landed further along a fence. A distant cuckoo called, my first of the year. Our joy was complete when we spotted and heard the unmistakable coin-spinning song of a wood warbler. A splinter of sound alerted us to a goldcrest. Having lost my high-frequency hearing, I can only hear goldcrests when they are close, so I was delighted to catch what the writer Tim Dee calls their “fuse-wire call”. This tiny forest sprite, flitting among branches of oak, flew down to a cluster of side shoots and disappeared. Focusing our binoculars, we realised it had a nest: a fragile hammock quilted from spider’s web, moss stems and lichen fragments melded among the branches. As we gazed, a burst of golden feather and an eye stared back at us. Bluebells spangled the woodland floor, flowering later than in my north-west home. Huge ancient rocks had tumbled downslope to the Tywi, one providing a dipper’s diving board. Trees thinned, slopes eased and light flared as our walk came to an end. A friend whispered: “This place is magical”.

Jason Bernard Kennison died on Friday. His family said “he achieved his goal of reaching the peak … he stood on top of this world but sadly didn’t come home.” The 40-year-old mechanic was part of an expedition run by Asian Trekking, whose managing director, Dawa Steven Sherpa, told the Himalayan Times that Kennison had started showing abnormal behaviour from the south summit. The two Sherpa guides with him helped him down to the balcony area, which is 8,400m above sea level. The guides descended to camp four after Kennison refused to move, Sherpa said. “Since the oxygen cylinders that they had with them were running out, they decided to descend to camp four, hoping to climb back again with oxygen cylinders to rescue him,” Sherpa told Agence France-Presse. But strong winds and bad weather prevented the guides from returning immediately, the Himalayan Times reports. Kennison’s climb came 17 years after he was told he might never walk again, following a 2006 car accident that left him battling spinal cord injuries and depression. He was using his ascent to raise money for Spinal Cord Injuries Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He recounted on his Just Giving page how the motivation to climb Everest came after another spinal procedure three years ago brought another round of rehab: “Someone close to me convinced me that I was still capable of being able to do anything I wanted.” He said the gift of a surfboard had given him the motivation “to see my life in a different light, to view what I was missing personally inside, and admire the obstacles that I had overcome”. “In 2023 I will head to Nepal, to see and be on Mount Everest, a long way from once battling traumatic injuries and the low and dark days of depression. An ambitious feat that I would never have dreamed of, or thought was possible after once being told that I would not be able to walk. “I am going to make the most of my life and part of that involves helping other people who have had their life changed in an instant through spinal cord injury. They shouldn’t be forgotten; they should be helped.” His family said on social media: “He was the most courageous, adventurous human we knew and he will be forever missed.” Before he left for Everest, Kennison told 7News: “I’ve always challenged myself internally overcoming these things. Everest has become this symbol to me of overcoming those challenges and getting that fulfilment.” In the lead-up to the ascent he flew to New Zealand for mountaineering courses, practised abseiling and rock climbing, and set up training in his back yard for ladder crossing, jumaring and roping.

The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand ruled on Monday that New Zealand mānuka beekeepers’ attempt for a trademark did not meet necessary requirements, and the term mānuka was descriptive. Mānuka refers to a white flowered tree that grows in both New Zealand and Australia – although it is more widely known as “tea tree” in Australia. The bees that browse its tiny pale blooms produce a kind of honey known for antibacterial and supposed health properties – and which fetches a significant price markup on the international market as a result. At the highest concentrations, some New Zealand batches have fetched up to NZ$2,000 to $5,000 for a 250g jar at luxury stores overseas. The lucrative nature of the product has been responsible for outbreaks of crime in New Zealand, with fierce competition over access to mānuka forests spurring mass poisonings of bees, thefts, vandalism and beatings. For more than a decade, however, the two countries have been at loggerheads over the use of the mānuka name – a Māori word, which New Zealand argues is an indigenous treasure, uniquely associated with its own honey production. Pita Tipene, Chair of the Manuka Charitable Trust, said the decision was “disappointing in so many ways”. He said the trust would pause to regroup, before continuing its battle. “If anything, it has made us more determined to protect what is ours on behalf of all New Zealanders and consumers who value authenticity,” he said. “Our role as kaitiaki [guardians] to protect the mana [dignity] and value of our taonga [treasured] species, including mānuka on behalf of all New Zealanders is not contestable.” Australian industry players welcomed the decision as a “commonsense outcome” and issued a press release saying they had plans to grow international sales in response to rising demand. Australian Manuka Honey Association chairman Ben McKee said he was “delighted” by the ruling. “Our product has a long history of being recognised as manuka honey, it is produced like the NZ product is, and it also offers the sought-after antimicrobial properties that consumers around the world value so highly,” he said. New Zealand producers first tried to trademark the term in 2015. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand called the fight “a trans-Tasman tussle of extraordinary proportions” and said in its ruling that it was “one of the most complex and long-running proceedings to have come before the Intellectual Property Office”. The latest decision follows a similar 2021 ruling from the UK to not grant trademark status."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/toronto-don-river-roars-back-to-life","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T04:00:45Z","webTitle":"How Toronto’s Don River, once declared dead, is roaring back to life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/toronto-don-river-roars-back-to-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/toronto-don-river-roars-back-to-life","fields":{"headline":"How Toronto’s Don River, once declared dead, is roaring back to life","bodyText":"After decades of illness, including a cholera scare and bouts of malaria, Toronto’s Don River succumbed to mounting neglect and was pronounced dead in 1969. A funeral procession of environmental activists wound through the city, with mourners gathering at the polluted banks of the river to pay their final respects. After more than half a century, however, the river has roared back to life. Wildlife is gingerly returning to areas that were once the site of heavy industry. Its waters will soon become cleaner. And perhaps most unlikely of all: after decades of advocacy work from a small group of frustrated citizens, the city is spending billions to save a body of water which was long despised and feared. Unlike other rivers bisecting a major city, the waterway, named after the River Don in Yorkshire, is neither revered nor loved. It lacks the grandeur of the Seine, the sacredness of the Ganges or the power of the Mississippi. On most days, it is little more than overgrown creek, occasionally morphing into a torrent of turbid waters in a rainstorm. Indigenous peoples, including the Anishinaabe, Seneca and Mississauga, would fish its shores and harvest from along its banks. But the thick and wild ravine system the river flows through was hard to navigate, pushing early inhabitants westward. For most Toronto’s urban history, it was a dumping ground, said Jennifer Bonnell, an associate professor of history at Toronto’s York University. Tanneries, distilleries and abattoirs discharged effluent into the river and dead livestock could be found drifting in the murky water. Walking past a lush mix of trees and marshes on a former brownfield site, Bonnell said: “Because of its proximity to the city, it served as that kind of place for refuge. And, with that a place of a place that you could get lost – but also a place where you get injured or mugged.” Bonnell’s book, Reclaiming the Don, chronicles the river’s death and potential resurrection, including a decision to pump raw sewage directly into the river in the 1860s, and the several occasions on which the river caught fire. In the early 20th century, the naturalist and writer Charles Sauriol described scenes of children splashing in the river under the shade of butternut and maple trees. But his passion for the waterway remained a minority opinion. “For decades, very few Torontonians believed that this river could be redeemed at all. It was just the price of prosperity, a throwaway kind of sacrificial landscape,” said Bonnell. When he moved from a rural American community to Toronto in 1972, John Wilson was struck by the “beautiful loneliness” of the river, which he accessed by scaling chain link fences. Drawn in by the burgeoning conservation movement, Wilson committed himself to fighting for the river. “I looked around at this and realized we could do better. I wanted to be a role model for my children, to give them a community worth living in,” he said. Smith became a key figure in the Task Force to Bring Back the Don, a citizen-led group that took a hands-on approach to mending the broken river. The group restored wetlands, cleaned its banks, and reduced the city’s use of road salt, which invariably flowed into the river each winter. But the group, staffed largely with volunteers, was dissolved in 2010 by Toronto mayor Rob Ford. Now, however, one of the Task Force’s main goals, the restoration of the river’s mouth, is nearing completion after the city invested more than C$1bn to create wetlands, levees and a new route for the Don. The project, led by Waterfront Toronto, will add 3 hectares of new coastal wetland and 4 hectares of habitat in a space that was once a post-industrial wasteland. During construction, which is due to finish in a few months, beaver, mink, bald eagles, deer and coyote have been spotted in the area. The project also creates a more natural meander to the river, over-turning human attempts to “straitjacket” the river, said Bonnell. But the biggest change is coming to the river itself. In Toronto Regional Conservation Authority’s (TRCA) most recent water quality report card, the most heavily urbanized portion of the Don River scored an “F” for its elevated levels of phosphorus, nutrients, chlorides, salt and e coli, said Sameer Dhalla, director of development and engineering services at the TRCA. Nearly a quarter of Toronto has an outdated system of piping that combines storm runoff with raw sewage, spilling into the river when rain hits the city. The city is spending C$3bn to build three tunnels that will route untreated sewage away from the river – the largest and costliest project of its kind in Canada. When all three tunnels are completed in the next 15 years, it will mark an end to sewer overflows. “We’re going to really see substantial benefits in the lower Don’s water quality once they deal with all these combined sewer overflows,” said Dhalla. “We want to see the Don River swimmable. We want to see that the fish are healthy and even edible.” Bonnell says the rerouting of the sewage will be “revolutionary” for a river pushed to its limits – a once unimaginable outcome that highlights the resilience of natural systems. The confluence of nature and urbanization nearly always leads in one direction, from vitality to destruction. But the fate of the Don, prematurely declared dead more than half a century ago, suggests that with sustained grassroots effort – and both political and financial willpower – that seemingly inevitable trajectory can bend. “There aren’t a lot of hopeful signs in the wider world today. But it’s hard not to want to hope for a better life for my children and future generations,” said Wilson. “And so have to hold on, as hard as you can, to the positive things that you can see, and to those around you. This is one of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/whale-watching-season-begins-australia-sydney-east-coast-humpback-whales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T03:53:45Z","webTitle":"Young humpbacks ‘full of beans’ as whale-watching season takes off in Sydney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/whale-watching-season-begins-australia-sydney-east-coast-humpback-whales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/whale-watching-season-begins-australia-sydney-east-coast-humpback-whales","fields":{"headline":"Young humpbacks ‘full of beans’ as whale-watching season takes off in Sydney","bodyText":"Carrie Davis describes seeing her first adult humpback whale of the season launching out of the water off the coast of Sydney last week as magical. “It’s just this feeling of awe to see this fat whale of that size get all that body out of the water,” said Davis of Go Whale Watching in Sydney. “No matter how many times you see it, it always takes your breath away.” The annual procession of humpback whales migrating north from their summer feeding grounds in Antartica to warmer waters in the Great Barrier Reef has begun. Sydneysiders can look forward to another bumper season, which spans May to July, of whales performing tail and dorsal fin slaps, breaches and head lunges, with an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 whales expected to pass the east coast. Davis said a boat trip was the best way to spot a whale so viewers could see the giants perform their acrobatics up close. The whales can also often be spotted from any headland. Any time of day was good for catching a glimpse, she said, but viewers will have the most luck on a stormy day when whales breach the most. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup So far, Davis said, the whale-watching crews have mostly spotted juvenile humpbacks off the coast of Sydney as they race ahead of the pack. “They’re full of beans, they’re really excited, and they’re really fat from getting their feed in Antartica,” she said. “We don’t get the pregnant mummas until the end because they want to eat as much as they can before they leave.” Prof Mike Noad, director of the Centre of Marine Studies at the University of Queensland, said it was difficult to know how many humpback whales there were given the last major survey of the population was conducted in 2015. But humpback whale populations have boomed since commercial whaling was banned in the region in the 1960s and an estimated 300 Australian humpback whales remained. Last year humpback whales were struck from the threatened species list. But this drew the ire of a number of scientists due to the threats the species continues to face such as the climate crisis. Davis said the whale-watching season slightly dipped in August but ramped up again from September to November as the animals returned south with their babies in tow. This is when the far south coast of New South Wales, particularly around Merimbula at Eden, becomes the best place to catch a glimpse of the giants. “Whales really respond to noise and you can imagine that Darling Harbour is like a speaker phone, so much noise is channelled out of there and into the ocean, so they love to rest with their babies around Green Cape as they head south.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/clare-nowland-95-year-old-tasered-by-nsw-police-aged-care-nursing-home-end-of-life-care","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T03:11:53Z","webTitle":"Clare Nowland: aged care resident Tasered by police remains in ‘heavy sleep’ amid end-of-life care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/clare-nowland-95-year-old-tasered-by-nsw-police-aged-care-nursing-home-end-of-life-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/clare-nowland-95-year-old-tasered-by-nsw-police-aged-care-nursing-home-end-of-life-care","fields":{"headline":"Clare Nowland: aged care resident Tasered by police remains in ‘heavy sleep’ amid end-of-life care","bodyText":"Clare Nowland, the aged care resident who was Tasered by a police officer in Cooma last week, remains in a “heavy sleep” and is comfortable, surrounded by her family, who held a bedside mass for her on Sunday as she continues to receive end-of-life care. Calls grew on Monday for a broader independent investigation of police treatment of dementia sufferers after revelations in the Guardian that six officers handcuffed a second nursing home resident, Rachel Grahame, in 2020 after she took a staff member’s lanyard. The New South Wales police commissioner, Karen Webb, also continued to publicly defend the transparency around the Nowland case and revealed that she had approved an initial statement describing the incident as an “interaction” with Nowland, failing to make any reference to Taser use. Nowland, 95, remains in Cooma district hospital, surrounded by family, in a critical condition with head injuries sustained as she fell back after being hit by the Taser. She was visited on Sunday by parish priest Mark Croker, who said she was comfortable and remained in a heavy sleep. “At the same time, I think she knows that family are around her and one of them said in the last couple of days she took one of the family members’ hand and just kissed them on the hand,” Croker told the Guardian. “A couple of times she has squeezed the hand of one of the family’s members. She is comfortable anyway, that is the main point.” Croker said the family understood the realities of her condition. “I think they’re realistic and that Mum’s probably instilled that into them in their faith and belief in a life beyond here,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Webb spoke to radio station 2GB on Monday about police’s handling of the incident, confirming she had seen the first statement before it was made public last Wednesday, the same day police used a Taser on Nowland at the council-run Yallambee Lodge aged care facility. That statement said an elderly woman had “sustained injuries during an interaction with police at an aged care facility in the state’s south today”. It made no mention of police using a Taser on a woman with dementia. Webb said police were “not hiding anything”. “It was important that the family were informed of the situation in a factual manner before we went public on it, and I think that’s very necessary, and I’m sure that family appreciates that now,” she said. Webb also defended her decision not to watch footage of the incident from body-worn cameras. She said it was important to watch the footage “in the context of all the other statements and evidence”. “It may be the case in the future where I have to make a determination based on a brief of evidence, without being tainted by having seen a part of the brief without context,” Webb said. “It’s important that we follow a process. I will make my determination impartially.” Guardian Australia revealed on Sunday that police had used handcuffs to restrain an 81-year-old, 45kg dementia sufferer in a Randwick nursing home in 2020, after being called by staff. Video of the incident shows the handcuffed dementia sufferer, Rachel Grahame, howling and in distress as police repeatedly tell her to calm down. The Greens’ justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said police should ensure an independent investigation into their handling of such cases. “What has happened to Ms Nowland needs to be a turning point. We can not have police investigating police anymore,” Higginson said. “The details of the violent arrest of 81-year-old Rachel Grahame in 2020 that were revealed yesterday show that NSW police have not made any progress since that incident and in fact things have gotten worse. “We need to start doing things differently and that must start with a full investigation by an appropriate independent body and that’s the LECC [Law Enforcement Conduct Commission].” Police declined to comment on the incident involving Grahame because it was the subject of civil proceedings. Those civil proceedings, in which police were sued for assault and false imprisonment, settled and resulted in a payout to Grahame and her family."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/sa-opposition-leader-criticised-over-beheading-remark-when-defending-anti-protest-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T02:53:56Z","webTitle":"SA opposition leader criticised over beheading remark when defending anti-protest laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/sa-opposition-leader-criticised-over-beheading-remark-when-defending-anti-protest-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/sa-opposition-leader-criticised-over-beheading-remark-when-defending-anti-protest-laws","fields":{"headline":"SA opposition leader criticised over beheading remark when defending anti-protest laws","bodyText":"Human Rights Watch and the Greens have criticised comments from South Australia’s opposition leader that protesters would face beheading in other countries. The state last week rushed through new anti-protest laws the day after a rally outside the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association conference in Adelaide briefly blocked traffic. The state Liberal leader, David Speirs, proposed the laws on talkback radio Thursday morning, which received bipartisan support and passed parliament in “almost record time,” Speirs said. Asked at a media conference over the weekend whether those new laws could silence political opinion, the opposition leader said Australia was “doing pretty good” if protesters were able to march down the main street in a planned protest supported by police. “There are some countries where your head would be cut off for doing that sort of protest. That’s not the case in Australia. “Protest is a good thing, but if you’re going to do stupid stuff that puts your life at risk, that puts other lives at risk, you can expect to get up to a $50,000 fine.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup However, Human Rights Watch research Sophie McNeill said Speir’s comments were “disgraceful”. “Peaceful protest is not something we should feel grateful for – it is a basic human right that is guaranteed to us under international law, that Australia is obliged to uphold and protect,” McNeill said. Speirs said in a statement on Monday morning that he will not express regret for highlighting that recent changes to penalties in South Australia “have no comparison to devastating and potentially life-ending consequences some people face in other countries just for vocalising their beliefs”. “Protest is – and will always be – a crucial part of democracy in Australia and we are so very fortunate to have the opportunity to express our views and beliefs in a peaceful way. “I support the right of every South Australian to protest safely, but intentionally blocking access to major hospitals and swinging off bridges is not OK.” South Australian Greens MP Tammy Franks said Speirs’s comments were “ill-considered”. “Being told that you should be grateful not to have a head chopped off if you’re protesting in South Australia in 2023 is no excuse for the rushed legislation that we’ve seen going through the state parliament that brings us some of the worst anti-protest laws in the country. Franks said Speirs previously called her the leader of the “rabid left” when she spoke at a snap protest against the repeal of Roe v Wade in the United States, criticising his position on reproductive rights. “The man’s a little out of touch,” Franks said. Franks said Speirs’ comments also recalled those of another Liberal leader, former prime minister Scott Morrison, when he declared it a “triumph of democracy” that campaigners for women’s justice were able to rally without being “met with bullets”. “Democracy is actually founded from the right to protest,” Franks said. “I’m a woman in parliament, I wouldn’t actually be able to hold a seat or vote for my elected member in our democratic system if there hadn’t been protesters and protesters who are willing to put themselves on the line to break the law. “People protest where there’s injustice, and where there’s injustice, we should support the right for peaceful protest in our democracy to make it better,” she said. McNeill said: “South Australia was the first place in the world to allow women to stand for parliament, the second to allow women to vote. That social progress was achieved through mass protest, through disruption. “It is a real shame that both the major parties in South Australia seem to have forgotten that proud history, as they work together to try and take away people’s basic rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/may/22/foo-fighters-announce-josh-freese-as-new-drummer-after-taylor-hawkins-death","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T02:21:41Z","webTitle":"Foo Fighters announce Josh Freese as new drummer after Taylor Hawkins’ death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/foo-fighters-announce-josh-freese-as-new-drummer-after-taylor-hawkins-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/22/foo-fighters-announce-josh-freese-as-new-drummer-after-taylor-hawkins-death","fields":{"headline":"Foo Fighters announce Josh Freese as new drummer after Taylor Hawkins’ death","bodyText":"Foo Fighters have unveiled their new drummer after the death of their former percussionist Taylor Hawkins: the veteran session musician Josh Freese. Freese has accrued a long and star-studded list of credits over his three-decade career. The 50-year-old drummer has been a member of Devo since 1996 and the Vandals since 1989. He has also toured with the Offspring, Guns N’ Roses, Danny Elfman, Weezer, Sting, Paramore, Nine Inch Nails and 100 Gecs. The band revealed the news on Sunday in a tongue-in-cheek livestream titled Foo Fighters: Preparing Music for Concerts, which promised “a few surprises”. Recorded in their studio, the livestream opened with the band teasing the identity of their new drummer by calling in a slew of famous cameos. Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith made a boisterous entrance – only to complain that someone was blocking his way in the car park. Motley Crue’s Tommy Lee appeared with a food delivery, while Tool’s Danny Carey showed up with a pair of poodles. A voice then interrupted the proceedings, and the camera cut to an exasperated Freese, who had been waiting off-camera behind a drum kit. “Excuse me!” he shouted. “Could we just, like … play a song?” The livestream featured an eight-song set, including new tracks from Foo Fighters’ upcoming 11th album, But Here We Are. In January, the band announced they would remain together and continue performing after the death of Hawkins, who died aged 50 last year while on tour in Colombia. “Without Taylor, we never would have become the band that we were,” they wrote in a statement. “And without Taylor, we know that we’re going to be a different band going forward.” Freese’s first show with Foo Fighters will take place in New Hampshire on 24 May, the opening leg of a global tour that will stretch until late 2023. The tour marks the first time the band have performed live since their two memorial concerts for Hawkins last September, where an all-star lineup of musicians including Paul McCartney, Queen and Mark Ronson paid tribute to the late drummer. Freese himself performed with Foo Fighters at those concerts, playing on Hawkins’ drums. “I was asked what drums I’d like to use,” he wrote on Instagram at the time. “Without hesitation I said, ‘Taylor’s drums need to be up there and I want to play on his exact set-up.’” No cause of death for Hawkins has been announced, but a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in Hawkins’s body, including opioids, marijuana and antidepressants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-police-officer-found-guilty-of-assault-after-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T02:19:59Z","webTitle":"NSW police officer found guilty of assault after slamming Indigenous boy face-first on to pavement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-police-officer-found-guilty-of-assault-after-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-police-officer-found-guilty-of-assault-after-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement","fields":{"headline":"NSW police officer found guilty of assault after slamming Indigenous boy face-first on to pavement","bodyText":"A New South Wales police officer has been found guilty of assaulting a 16-year-old Indigenous boy in inner Sydney in 2020 when he arrested him and threw him to the ground using an unofficial “leg sweep” manoeuvre. Magistrate Rami Attia on Monday found constable Ryan Barlow guilty of occasioning actual bodily harm, dismissing claims the officer had felt threatened when the teenager of slight build said that he would “crack you across the fucking jaw, bro” from four metres away. The case garnered national attention when mobile phone footage of the violent arrest – taken by the boy’s friends – was posted online. That footage, along with body-worn camera footage from Barlow and other officers present, was central to the case. The footage showed the moment the teenager made the threat towards the officer after he and his friends were approached in Ward Park, Surry Hills. It also showed the following six seconds in which the officer told the teenager to turn around and get on the floor, telling him he would arrest him for threatening him. The magistrate found that Barlow gave the teenager 3.02 seconds to comply with his demands, during which time he had hold of him and then proceeded to employ a “leg sweep” technique, holding his arms behind his back and kicking his feet, causing him to fall forwards. The boy’s face, shoulder and hip made contact with the ground, before the officer pinned the boy to the floor using his knees while he reached for handcuffs. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The magistrate said the footage showed that the teen was “clearly and audibly in significant pain” and afterward struggled to stand up when asked to do so, saying he could not feel his knee. The magistrate found the police officer’s account was “difficult to follow in some instances” and did not accept his claims that the teenager had moved his legs in a way that indicated he was trying to kick him in the groin. “I cannot see what actions were taken by the complainant that constitutes a resistance to arrest,” Attia said on Monday morning at the Downing centre courts. “There was no further threat. There was certainly no further abusive language. “The risk of danger … was either minimal or nonexistent,” he added, as he dismissed the officer’s claim he deployed the “leg sweep” to defend himself. Attia outlined that the 16-year-old was of slight build, not armed and, while he did make a verbal threat, did so from a distance and while stationary in a neutral pose. “He made no movement towards the defendant, he did not say anything after,” Attia said, going on to explain the boy did not run away when the officer approached him, nor did he resist when he was grabbed and turned around before being forced to the ground. “The defendant gave the complainant no opportunity to comply with the command.” The court heard the teenager was laughing and joking before the altercation and was not aggressive despite his use of “crude” language. The technique used to get him to the ground is not a method taught to NSW police officers and carries a risk of injury. It is not banned. Barlow will be sentenced at a later date. He declined to comment on the outcome as he left court. The National Justice Project’s associate legal director Emma Hearne, who represented the teenager’s family, said the decision represented a “warning to NSW Police that they need to change their practices”. “We will continue our work in holding police to account for misconduct against the community in order to drive a change in culture,” she said outside court. “I have no doubt many others suffer similarly from police brutality, and today’s outcome is likely a result of the footage which provided clear evidence of what occurred. I hate to think what could have happened if bystander footage wasn’t available.” The use of force by police officers has again been in the news over the past week after a 95-year-old woman was Tasered in a Cooma nursing home. Clare Nowland was using a walking frame when she was Tasered in the early hours of last Wednesday, after she allegedly failed to drop a steak knife."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2023/may/22/state-of-origin-2023-qld-maroons-nsw-blues-test-of-nerve-new-blood-mixed-experience-team-squad","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T02:00:42Z","webTitle":"State of Origin 2023 shapes as test of nerve with new blood mixed with experience | Angus Fontaine ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/22/state-of-origin-2023-qld-maroons-nsw-blues-test-of-nerve-new-blood-mixed-experience-team-squad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/may/22/state-of-origin-2023-qld-maroons-nsw-blues-test-of-nerve-new-blood-mixed-experience-team-squad","fields":{"headline":"State of Origin 2023 shapes as test of nerve with new blood mixed with experience ","bodyText":"New South Wales have gone back to the future for State of Origin 2023, recalling a host of stars to their Game One squad while Queensland have overhauled their winning combinations from last year to blood a batch of young guns and forge a new dynasty. Blues coach Brad Fittler was first to name his Origin squad on Monday morning, confirming the return of box-office players Latrell Mitchell and Tom Trbojevic in the centres and moving swiftly to amend his big mistake from 2022 by recalling electric Bulldogs flier Josh Addo-Carr on the wing. Queensland coach Billy Slater, who led an unfancied Maroons outfit to a boilover 2-1 win in his first series at the helm, has doubled down in the quest for consecutive victories, dumping incumbent fullback Kalyn Ponga and axing Origin veteran Dane Gagai after their dismal showing in Newcastle’s limp loss to Cronulla at the weekend. Both teams will head to Adelaide for Origin 1 on 31 May with squads boasting proven experience and untried talent. But there is also rust and risk in both state’s selections. Mitchell and Trbojevic reunite in the centres after missing last year’s series, the latter catching Fittler’s eye with a three try performance in the Sea Eagles’ upset of the Raiders. Trbojevic is far from firing on all cylinders and still looks ginger in contact. Yet Fittler has snubbed the season’s form centre Rabbitoh Campbell Graham and trusted the Manly maestro to deliver on the big stage. Mitchell delivered a largely listless performance in Souths’ shock defeat to Parramatta on Friday and looked emotionally spent from a busy lead-up into Indigenous Round. But he still has a smile on his face, magic in his hands and plenty in the tank and that will spell trouble for the Maroons. With his sublime passing game and Trbojevic’s running lines, they could combine as explosively as nitro and glycerine. Slater has added spark and starch to his Queensland side. In-form pocket rocket Reece Walsh has been in dazzling form for the Broncos and will debut at fullback in place of Ponga while Dolphins speedster Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow swept Gagai aside in the centres. Gold Coast behemoth David Fifita and Rabbitohs backrower Jai Arrow have been recalled to duty after being overlooked for the Maroons last year. Both coaches were blindsided by star Raiders withdrawing from Origin duties, with Blues utility Jack Wighton and Maroons hitman Josh Papali’i opting out. Injuries and suspensions will also ripple into Games Two and Three. The suspended Felice Kaufusi and Tino Fa’asuamaleaui will reappear for Queensland, while Blues tyro Jake Trbojevic is a late scratching for Game One replaced by the Bulldogs’ Tevita Pangai Junior. It means Slater and Fittler have had to dig deeper and extend trust further to find heavy artillery up front and precision weaponry out wide. For all its talk of using established combinations, Origin is a test of nerve – back the incumbents or blood the newbies? Fittler fumbled his selections in 2022 while Slater aced his. Happily for both, the spines of the teams that fought out the 2022 series remain largely untouched. Fittler has again entrusted his future to his old clubmen, those who make up the Panthers’ attack axis, with Jarome Luai at five-eighth and Nathan Cleary at halfback restored trusted at No 6 and 7, teammates Liam Martin and and Isaah Yeo running off their shoulders, and winger Brian To’o as the finisher. Ex-Panther Apisai Koroisau, spark-plug for the Wests Tigers’ 66-18 flogging of North Queensland, is their No 9 with Cronulla champion Nicho Hynes debuting at No 14. For Queensland, Cameron Munster and Daly Cherry-Evans bring fire and ice in the halves while Dragon Ben Hunt and Storm’s Harry Grant are the dynamic hooking duo. Hunt has been through the mill at St George and will relish the chance to lead a star-studded side and replicate his match-winning feats from Game Three at Suncorp last year. He has Bronco Selwyn Cobbo and Cowboy Murray Taulagi twitching in the wings. The omissions are notable but not unexpected. Despite consistent energy for Souths, Damien Cook’s 15-game shift as NSW rake may be over while Daniel Tupou was badly shown up in the air and in defence subbing for the snubbed Addo-Carr last year. For Queensland, backrower Kurt Capewell’s struggle with a shoulder injury could be terminal and former match-winner Gagai’s defence has finally proven his weak point. As for mercurial Maroons fullback Ponga, his time sidelined with four concussions in the past 10 months is said to have forced Slater’s hand. Despite featuring in all three games and delivering a man of the match performance in last year’s series decider, the fallen Knight’s errors in the 26-6 loss to Cronulla showed he has a long way to go before Slater hands him the No 1 jersey he made famous in 31 Origins across a decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/volodymyr-zelenskiy-uses-g7-summit-to-reach-beyond-the-west-for-support","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T02:00:42Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy uses G7 summit to reach beyond the west for support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/volodymyr-zelenskiy-uses-g7-summit-to-reach-beyond-the-west-for-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/volodymyr-zelenskiy-uses-g7-summit-to-reach-beyond-the-west-for-support","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy uses G7 summit to reach beyond the west for support","bodyText":"Normally G7 summits are about battling for the free world comma by comma, as diplomats parse lengthy communiques of ephemeral significance long into the night. Words, after all, constitute much of a diplomat’s work. At the Hiroshima G7 some of the communiques emerging from the summit do matter, notably the toolbox on de-risking trade with China, but the true significance of the summit lay in Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s scene-stealing visit courtesy of a ride in Emmanuel Macron’s French aircraft. It was the culmination of a Ukrainian realisation that for months they have been talking to wrong people. Yes, it is essential to keep lines constantly open to Ukraine’s invested allies in the west, reaping the rewards such as Joe Biden’s decision finally to lift his veto on Ukrainian pilots training to fly US-made F-16 fighter aircraft, but the identification of the west with Ukraine’s cause is almost complete. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks by saying “Slava Ukrajni – Glory to Europe”. But Ukraine for months has known it is not telling its story clearly enough to the phalanx of 40 or so nonaligned states that have abstained at successive UN general assembly votes on the war. India, Brazil, China and as many as 20 African states have sat on the sidelines in the key votes. In the autumn it decided there was no substitute for its own diplomats making their case, rather relying on US or UK intermediaries. It has involved a change in mindset and strain on resources. Ukraine, for instance, has only 10 embassies throughout Africa. In October the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, undertook a four-nation tour of Africa, visiting Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Kenya. “Russia’s narrative has been very present here,” he said. “Now it’s time for Ukrainian truths.” Over the ensuing week, Kuleba attempted to counter Russia’s three “lies” as he put it to African journalists. He noted that Russia had first attacked Ukraine in 2014 when Ukraine’s policy was neutrality not Nato membership. The second Russian lie was that Russia and Ukraine were actually one country, and so the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had the right to impose his will on Ukraine. “In fact we are very different countries with our own languages, cultures and histories. Imagine your neighbour coming to you and saying your language, culture and history do not exist. Your statehood is a mistake.” The third lie was that “only Russia wanted to negotiate peace”. Kuleba offered a similar message at the weekend when speaking to the Association of Caribbean States, the first Ukrainian to do so. Emine Dzhaparova, the deputy foreign minister, brought similar talking points when she travelled to India in April, referencing similarities in the two countries’ struggles against colonialism but also pointedly wondering why India’s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, had visited Moscow three times recently and never flown to Kyiv. All this is not about Ukraine piling up an extra 20 votes at the UN for the sake of it, but has a practical purpose. Ukraine wants these countries’ political support for a peace summit it hopes to hold in July but also wants to stem the sanctions leakage. The one-on-one meetings Zelenskiy has been able to hold with the Gulf states – notably with the United Arab Emirates’ deputy prime minister in Jeddah – and with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, in Hiroshima may not be “a gamechanger” as Macron claims. However, they gave Zelenskiy a chance to point out that breaking the west’s sanctions on Russia, while legal, is ultimately immoral and certainly not an act of neutrality. His single biggest target was India, and Zelenskiy secured his first meeting with Modi. Indian orders of Russian oil increased 22-fold in 2022, most of it to just two firms. As a result Russia’s estimated oil export revenues increased by $1.7bn (£1.37bn) to $15bn on the back of these higher exports and less discounting. But persuading India to stop importing Russian oil at low prices is made even harder when Europe is itself re-importing this oil from India in refined form. At least Zelenskiy got facetime with Modi. By contrast, the Brazilian president, Lula de Silva, citing “scheduling reasons” refused to meet Zelenskiy one on one. The Brazilian delegation briefed it felt cornered because it had been given no prior warning Zelenskiy was invited, or would be seeking a meeting. The Brazilian side say a time was eventually agreed to meet but Zelenskiy did not arrive. In his speech to the G7, Lula said that he “condemns the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity” and, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, “vehemently repudiates the use of force as a means of resolving disputes”. In truth Lula’s stance on Ukraine has been evolving ever since on a visit to China he blamed Nato expansionism and said the US must “stop promoting war and start talking about peace”. Lula was accused of aping Moscow’s talking points. At the same time his reluctance to sign up to a pro-western agenda remains undimmed. He told the G7 that the solution to the current systemic threats “does not lie in the formation of antagonistic blocs or responses that contemplate only a small number of countries”. It makes no sense to call on emerging countries to contribute to resolving the crises facing the world without their concerns being addressed, Lula said, while also calling for a reform in the composition of the main global governance bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the UN security council. Ultimately, until this range of issues is addressed, Zelenskiy’s increasingly artful diplomatic outreach will only take him so far."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/socceroos-lock-in-friendly-against-world-champions-argentina-in-china","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T01:46:42Z","webTitle":"Socceroos lock in friendly against world champions Argentina in China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/socceroos-lock-in-friendly-against-world-champions-argentina-in-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/socceroos-lock-in-friendly-against-world-champions-argentina-in-china","fields":{"headline":"Socceroos lock in friendly against world champions Argentina in China","bodyText":"The Socceroos and Argentina will renew their recent rivalry with a friendly match to be played in Beijing, as an Australian national sporting team makes a rare appearance on Chinese soil on 15 June. Lionel Messi was on the scoresheet as he led his team to a 2-1 victory over the Socceroos in the last 16 at last year’s World Cup in Qatar, on the South Americans’ way to becoming world champions for a third time. Another meeting has long been rumoured to take place, with coach Graham Arnold having indicated his desire for the game to go ahead, saying last month that he had “goosebumps” just thinking of the prospect. Arnold pointed to the importance of playing top-quality teams ahead of a new World Cup cycle and an Asian Cup campaign in January next year, with a clash against England at Wembley already in the diary for 14 October. Football Australia on Monday confirmed the latest fixture, and it is hoped the match at the Workers’ Stadium in Beijing opens the door to more games against big-name opposition, but on home soil in the future. “I do think if we become a regular team in the upper echelon of world football, then coming out to Australia, despite its distance, may not seem so far for people,” FA chief executive, James Johnson, said. “If you want a seat at the world football table, these are the things you’ve got to do. You’ve got to host big competitions, like the Women’s World Cup. You’ve got to play big opposition like Argentina, you’ve got to play at Wembley – you’ve got to do that. “On the women’s side, you’ve got to play the best in the world, you’ve got to play the United States. “If you look at all these examples, in isolation, you might not see the strategy. If you bring it all together, though, there is an undertone which is, ‘We’re Australia, we’re here, we’re at the seat now and we want to stay at the world table.’” Kick-off will be at 10pm AEST, and it will be the first time the two sides have met since the nail-biting encounter at in December that saw the Socceroos’ thrilling run come to an end. The Socceroos last played in China in 2008, as part of their World Cup qualifying campaign, and the upcoming match will be the first time since early 2020 that a senior Australian national sporting team has competed in China. Planning for the fixture had the support of both nation’s governments, as well as FA and its counterpart the Chinese Football Association. “It’s been 15 years since our senior men’s national team played in China, and we are truly excited to be returning to face Argentina at the newly renovated Workers’ Stadium in Beijing,” Johnson said. The match is almost certain to sell out, with previous visits by Messi having attracted huge interest in China. The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner has played in China six times since 2005, but has not been to the country for six years. Argentina will also play Indonesia in Jakarta four days later. It will be the first time Arnold’s team have played since the home friendlies against Ecuador in March this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/guy-pearce-confirms-he-will-appear-in-neighbours-revival","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T01:40:29Z","webTitle":"Guy Pearce confirms he will appear in Neighbours revival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/guy-pearce-confirms-he-will-appear-in-neighbours-revival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/guy-pearce-confirms-he-will-appear-in-neighbours-revival","fields":{"headline":"Guy Pearce confirms he will appear in Neighbours revival","bodyText":"Guy Pearce has confirmed he will make an appearance in the upcoming Neighbours reboot, after Amazon swooped in to revive the long-running Australian soap. The LA Confidential and Memento star began playing Mike Young in 1986 and appeared in more than 400 episodes over three years. Along with former Neighbours stars Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Margot Robbie, Pearce returned for what was thought to be the show’s finale in July. In the 90-minute episode, Mike was reunited with his former love interest Jane Harris, played by Annie Jones, with the pair buying a house on Ramsay Street. Speaking on the Good Weekend Talks podcast, Pearce said that given his character was now living on the soap’s famous street, he would appear in the new season out of respect for the show. “Annie and I called each other, ‘What do we do now, because we’re living in the street,’” Pearce said. “And she said, ‘Well I’m all right because I’m on the show anyway, but what are you going to do?’ I said, ‘I don’t know.’ So we’re in the process of working it out. “Obviously, if I’m going to extricate myself from the show, I want to do it respectfully. I wasn’t just gonna go, ‘Well, bad luck. You had your chance, that was it,’ you know. So there may be a little appearance or two, shall we say.” The soap was set to finish after a 37-year run, when the UK’s Channel 5 decided to stop airing it. But three months later, Fremantle announced that Neighbours would be revived with Amazon on board as new production partners. The surprise move was based on the response to the finale, which attracted 1.2 million viewers in Australia and 3 million in the UK. Pearce previously made some pointed comments about the show’s surprise return, saying Amazon’s decision “makes our finale look like a rather expensive exercise” and suggested Robbie could ask for the return of a crate of champagne she had sent the show’s producers as a farewell thank you present. “I don’t want to say [it was a] waste of time. But still, I’m sure that Margot will be happy,” he said in December, while presenting at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (Aacta) awards. Another actor confirmed to appear in the Neighbours revival is Mischa Barton, with the former star of US teen drama The OC set to play a “dynamic and unpredictable” character. Neighbours will be available to view on Channel 10 and Amazon Prime in Australia and on Amazon Freevee in the UK and US when it returns in the second half of 2023."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/sydney-train-network-plagued-by-almost-40000-defects-and-delays-likely-to-worsen","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T01:20:46Z","webTitle":"Sydney train network plagued by almost 40,000 defects – and delays ‘likely to worsen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/sydney-train-network-plagued-by-almost-40000-defects-and-delays-likely-to-worsen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/sydney-train-network-plagued-by-almost-40000-defects-and-delays-likely-to-worsen","fields":{"headline":"Sydney train network plagued by almost 40,000 defects – and delays ‘likely to worsen’","bodyText":"The number of active defects across Sydney’s train network has soared to almost 40,000, as a scathing review finds the performance of the transport system has been hit by recent outages and delays is “likely to worsen”. Defects related to infrastructure such as tracks and electrical circuiting – but not the train fleet itself – have increased from about 23,000 in December 2018 to about 37,000 in April this year. This has coincided with plunging on-time performance and spiralling service cancellations. The fragility of Sydney’s train network is largely the result of a network timetable introduced in November 2017 that attempted to maximise utilisation of the system but was “far too tight to effectively maintain service” and did not give “adequate access for maintenance of rail infrastructure”, an interim review of Sydney Trains has found. The review’s findings are scathing of the handling of the city’s train system under the previous Coalition government. It found that while “black swan” events such as Covid, bushfires and floods – as well as industrial action and union strikes – affected performance, these factors could not totally explain the deterioration of the network since the timetable was introduced. In fact, the review found the only time the network delivered punctuality in line with its targets – 92% of services running within five minutes of schedule – was during periods of lockdown and the strictest Covid movement restrictions. The 2017 timetable was introduced to increase network capacity in anticipation of growing patronage, an influx that never materialised due to the pandemic. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The review was announced about six weeks ago by incoming transport minister Jo Haylen after the Minns government won the March election. It will go on to examine the impact of the ageing train fleet and wider network before a final report in October, but has delivered a raft of interim recommendations to address reliability and resilience issues. On Monday, Haylen acknowledged the role of union action that directly correlated with punctuality and cancellation spikes in 2022. “I’m not excusing the role of the unions,” she said, adding that she would aim to avoid the tensions with the transport unions the previous Coalition government encountered. “Instead of choosing conflict, we will be looking for solutions,” she said. A major “maintenance blitz” over the next 12 months is the key recommendation of the interim report, which calls for an accelerated program to address defects and disruptions by targeting access to tracks for maintenance to periods of reduced patronage. Haylen accepted all of the review’s recommendations, but ruled out any service reductions to facilitate the maintenance blitz. She also ruled out additional spending to fund the maintenance, noting the “constrained financial times”. Matthew Longland, the chief executive of Sydney Trains, also ruled out additional track work closures. Instead, he insisted track work maintenance could be carried out more efficiently to focus on defects causing reliability issues and by better organising workers. The next year is seen as a window of opportunity for maintenance, with patronage still broadly between 70-80% of pre-Covid levels during weekdays. Additionally, the network is set for a new timetable when the metro line from Chatswood to Sydenham comes on to the network next year. Of the roughly 37,000 infrastructure defects, 1,265 are classified as priority one – meaning they need to be inspected every seven days. A large chunk of the remaining need to be inspected every 28 days. The defects include surface issues on the tracks, as well as electric circuits and overhead wiring at stations. The T1 line servicing Sydney’s western suburbs and north shore, as well as the city circle line, are suffering the most from serious defects. The backlog of defects is above sustainable levels, and the review will work to determine what an ongoing level of defects is manageable. The review found the safety of the network was not yet being impacted by the defects – but the head of the review, Carolyn Walsh, said she would be concerned if the issues highlighted were left unaddressed. “Network performance is not recovering. Under current projections of planned maintenance activity, the performance of Sydney Trains’ rail infrastructure is unlikely to improve. In fact, it is likely to worsen,” the review said. “There has been a focus on addressing safety critical and safety significant maintenance defects but under current projections (business as usual), the overall maintenance backlog will take a lengthy time to recover.” Another recommendation was for better dissemination of information during outages, including better delivery of announcements to passengers stuck on trains who are often left in the dark as to why they’ve stopped. The review also recommended that the Sydney Trains CEO report directly to the secretary of the transport department, and that Sydney Trains is more involved in designing the next new timetable so it is more accountable for performance. Before the review was announced, the network suffered three significant incidents within a 17-day period in March that “caused substantial disruption to the network and major inconvenience to customers”. Haylen said “we are running 100-year-old plus rail network and it needs to be maintained to keep running”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/new-zealand-announces-its-biggest-emissions-reduction-project-in-history","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T01:07:15Z","webTitle":"New Zealand announces its biggest emissions reduction project in history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/new-zealand-announces-its-biggest-emissions-reduction-project-in-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/new-zealand-announces-its-biggest-emissions-reduction-project-in-history","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand announces its biggest emissions reduction project in history","bodyText":"New Zealand has announced its largest emissions reduction project in history, transitioning from coal to renewable electricity at the country’s major steel plant in a move that the government says is equivalent to taking 300,000 cars off the road. The government will spend $140m on halving the coal used at Glenbrook steel plant to recycle scrap steel, replacing that generating power with an electric-powered furnace. The plant will contribute $160m to the project’s cost. Currently, the steel company accounts for 2% of New Zealand’s total emissions, through intensive burning of coal to melt down iron-rich sands into steel products. The new project will install a $300m electric-powered arc furnace to melt down scrap steel instead. That electricity will be provided by renewable energy through New Zealand’s national grid, which is primarily powered by wind, hydro and geothermal energy. Prime minister Chris Hipkins said the project “dwarfs anything we have done to date”. “This size of this project demonstrates how serious the government is about reducing New Zealand’s emissions as fast as possible,” he said. “Alone, it will eliminate 1% of the country’s total annual emissions.” The government says the plan will reduce New Zealand’s emissions by 800,000 tonnes annually. That is equivalent to removing the entire automobile fleet of Christchurch, one of New Zealand’s largest cities, from the road. “To understand the scale of this project, it reduces more emissions on its own than all the other 66 [government-funded emissions-reduction] projects we have approved to date,” Megan Woods, minister of energy and resources said. The electric-powered furnace is due to be running by 2026-7. Climate change expert prof James Renwick, of Victoria University, told the Guardian the project was “very significant” and “big news” for the country’s emissions goals. “It will be the biggest single reduction in national emissions when it comes into play,” he said. Still, Renwick added, there was “more work to do”. “1% is of national emissions is great, but we need to reduce 100%,” he said. “We need to do a lot more work.” The plan “will put New Zealand in a much better position to meet its climate target of net zero carbon by 2050,” climate minister James Shaw said. The plan marks a significant step in New Zealand actually reducing its greenhouse gas emissions – as opposed to buying offsets of tree-planting to reach net zero. In April, the Climate Commission warned that the country’s heavy reliance on planting trees to offset carbon pollution threatened to torpedo its ambitious plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Achieving a net reduction in emissions primarily through planting trees is impossible to sustain in the long term, experts have warned, as forests could be destroyed though fire or extreme weather and do not store carbon for ever. While New Zealand’s total contribution to global emissions is small, its gross emissions per capita are high. According to 2018 data, New Zealanders produce greenhouse gases equivalent to the heating power of 16.9 tonnes of carbon dioxide — more than double the per capita rate of the UK. The country has also been among the world’s worst performers on emission increases. “We can’t plant our way out of the problem of climate change,” Renwick said. “We need be focusing on gross emissions reduction rather than net.” Shaw said the deal was estimated to contribute 5.3% of the emissions reductions needed under New Zealand’s second emissions budget, which covers the period of 2026-2030, and 3.4% within the third emissions budget, of 2031-2035."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-epa-launches-investigation-into-cadia-goldmine-after-blood-tests-show-metal-contamination","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T00:43:06Z","webTitle":"NSW EPA launches investigation into Cadia goldmine after blood tests show metal contamination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-epa-launches-investigation-into-cadia-goldmine-after-blood-tests-show-metal-contamination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-epa-launches-investigation-into-cadia-goldmine-after-blood-tests-show-metal-contamination","fields":{"headline":"NSW EPA launches investigation into Cadia goldmine after blood tests show metal contamination","bodyText":"The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority has launched an investigation into Cadia goldmine near Orange after local residents, including children, reported blood tests with high levels of selenium, nickel and copper. In a statement, the EPA said Newcrest’s Cadia Holdings Pty Ltd was issued on Friday with a draft pollution prevention notice and a draft licence variation regarding the management of emissions of dust and other pollutants at the central west goldmine. The company has until Tuesday to respond. The EPA has also written to the NSW chief health officer requesting a full health risk analysis to determine if dust from the mine is having an impact on the health of the community. Tony Chappel, the NSW EPA chief executive, said industry had strict obligations to meet clean air standards and “currently Cadia appears to be falling well short of our expectations”. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter “Last week, the EPA received new evidence from the community to suggest actions by the mine to reduce dust pollution have not been effective,” he said. “Understandably, this community needs answers and so too does the EPA.” Guardian Australia understands that at least 1,000 people are estimated to be affected by heavy metal dust attributed to the mine. Most of those who have reported concerning blood test results and contaminated rainwater live within 15km of the mine in villages such as Forest Reefs and Errowanbang. Testing of the water supply in Orange, 22km away, has not revealed any contaminants. The EPA investigation follows years of lobbying by residents, coordinated by the Cadia Community Sustainability Network, which organised for rainwater tanks to be tested. They provided those initial results, which found unsafe levels of lead in a third of all sample tested, to the EPA and NSW Health in March. Both NSW Health and Newcrest then conducted their own testing, the results of which have not been released. NSW Greens spokesperson for the environment and regional communities, MP Sue Higginson, said what is happening within the community around Cadia is “shocking”. “When people, including children, are returning blood tests with heavy metals present and water supplies are contaminated with lead and other heavy metals, we have failed,” she said. Higginson put forward a notice of motion in the NSW legislative council last week, which flagged the blood test results and stated that “concerned residents have not received adequate responses” from the EPA, the Department of Planning or NSW Health. The EPA said it will re-test the mine’s main vent and ask the company to deploy a smart sensing network to allow real-time monitoring of air pollution. The draft licence variation also calls for the finalisation of an independent health risk assessment by NSW Health, and for the mine to engage a specialist to identify the source of the lead found in the sludge at the bottom of nearby rainwater tanks. The EPA said the investigation will run parallel to a seperate investigation into Cadia, which commenced last year and also relates to air quality concerns. “We understand the community will have questions and we want to work closely with them throughout our investigation,” Chappel said. Cadia’s acting general manager, Mick Dewar, said the company takes its environmental obligations and concerns raised by “some members of the local community” seriously. “We have and will continue to work openly with them and the EPA on their concerns raised,” Dewar said in a statement. “Aligned with the draft licence variations, earlier this year, we commenced a full human health risk assessment through SAGE Environmental, a comprehensive community drinking water sampling program, a lead isotype testing program through the University of South Australia, and a 12-month dust fingerprinting program through Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). “As a long-standing member of the local community, with many of our workforce, also local residents, we see ourselves very much part of this community. Nothing is more important than people’s health and safety, and we remain firmly committed to making sure that we meet all of our statutory obligations and do it in a way that is aligned with our values.” A community information session will be held at Millthorpe on Tuesday.

Jones said that BNPL is a “fintech success story” with some 7m active BNPL accounts in Australia, and praised it as “a valuable source of competitive pressure on traditional credit products, such as credit cards or payday loans”. “But with those opportunities have come new and growing dangers to consumers, which up until now have been largely unregulated and unchecked,” he said.

Jones said that according to a study conducted by Good Shepherd in late 2022, around 73% of financial counsellors said that clients have missed essential payments or cut back on essentials to pay off BNPL debt. “BNPL looks like credit, it acts like credit, it carries the risks of credit.” He said government consultation revealed concerns including: the quality of dispute resolution and hardship processes, excessive fees, poor disclosure practices, problematic marketing practices and unsolicited credit increases. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Jones announced a “strong and proportionate” solution to regulate BNPL “as credit products”. This includes requiring providers to: hold Australian credit licences, comply with responsible lending obligations, meet statutory dispute resolution and hardship requirements, comply with statutory product disclosure and other information obligations, and abide by existing restrictions on unacceptable marketing. “Our plan prevents lending to those who cannot afford it, without stopping safe, prudent BNPL use. “There are consumers out there who have been excluded from traditional forms of credit, and who use BNPL carefully and frugally, to smooth the impact of large expenses, like when the fridge needs replacing or one of the kids has a birthday coming up. “Some people use it for years and never miss a payment. We don’t want to make life harder for them.” Jones said the government would release exposure draft legislation out for consultation and introduce a bill by the end of the year. Asked if BNPL providers would be required to stop extending credit to existing customers in circumstances that don’t meet responsible lending requirements, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told Radio National there would be “appropriate transitional arrangements”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/ithaka-the-fight-to-free-assange-review-theres-no-better-show-about-the-wikileaks-founders-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:20:39Z","webTitle":"Ithaka: The Fight to Free Assange review – there’s no better show about the WikiLeaks founder’s battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/ithaka-the-fight-to-free-assange-review-theres-no-better-show-about-the-wikileaks-founders-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/ithaka-the-fight-to-free-assange-review-theres-no-better-show-about-the-wikileaks-founders-battle","fields":{"headline":"Ithaka: The Fight to Free Assange review – there’s no better show about the WikiLeaks founder’s battle","bodyText":"Julian Assange was taken to Belmarsh Prison in April 2019, initially after being found guilty of breaching bail conditions. That he is still there is, however, due to his actions a decade earlier: as the founder of WikiLeaks, the Australian journalist enraged the US by publishing a slew of classified material, most famously an information dump in 2010 that revealed evidence of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. The US wants to extradite Assange and try him on charges of espionage. Ithaka: The Fight to Free Assange opens in May 2019 and charts the first two years in his legal battle to resist. With Assange himself out of reach, Ithaka follows the efforts of his family members, mainly his father, John Shipton, to apply pressure on his behalf. It fits the normal rhythms of a film about campaigning: news archive provides context and to-camera interviews intersperse scenes that are shot in transit between engagements, as phone calls are received delivering good – or more often bad – news. The result is more a profile of Shipton, who stepped into the public eye for the first time following his son’s arrest, than Assange. Shipton is a not uninteresting figure, a slow, low talker with a love of daydreamy literary references. He speaks openly about how he absented himself for the entirety of Assange’s childhood, because he preferred his work as a builder to domestic commitment. “I don’t relate really well to people,” he says. In another life he might have been content on the fringes of society, his canny cynicism about governments and media the result merely of distant observation – as it is, his son being “in the shit” has drawn him into a new routine of TV appearances, tours of European parliaments, and strangers gripping his hand as they urge him to pass on messages of solidarity, experiences to which he has adjusted as well as he can. Perhaps his son’s troubles have awoken him in other ways as well: at 76, he has a five-year-old daughter. But Assange is a journalist being threatened with life behind bars for revealing grave truths, an individual in danger of being crushed by a country that advertises itself as the standard-bearer of superior western freedoms – who cares what the bloke’s dad is like? Some of the scenes building a picture of Shipton’s character could possibly have been cut, to slim the film’s 110-minute running time. The point, maybe, is that Assange is so friendless among people of influence that it has become necessary for his old man to have a go at becoming a press spokesman, lobbyist and legal expert all rolled into one. Apart from Assange’s wife Stella Moris, who cuts a resilient but taciturn figure here, worn down by bringing up two young children while watching her husband’s health and sanity ebb, there is seemingly nobody else – British politicians and commentators who identify as advocates of free speech, for example – available to assist. The film explains this by referring straightforwardly to a smear campaign against Assange, when the reality is a little subtler: although fellow journalists have spoken in opposition to his extradition, there have also been a large number of articles focusing on Assange’s supposed personality flaws. The world’s most famous accomplice of whistleblowers, a man under intense scrutiny who has been diagnosed as autistic, can apparently display odd behaviours and be hard to deal with. Moris has previously railed against “ambiguous, half-hearted defences”, a point that might usefully have been explored here. Nevertheless, Nils Melzer, the UN special rapporteur on torture who describes Assange’s continued confinement as “psychological torture”, does admit that he almost didn’t respond to requests to look into the Assange case, because the stigmatising effect of negative media coverage caused him to instinctively recoil from the name. Even for those who see the issue clearly, Assange’s imprisonment has become just another injustice, occasionally making its way back into the news cycle before being washed away by a constant rain of scandal, in an era when norms are exploded and rights eroded too quickly for citizens to monitor. The latest phase of his predicament has been making headlines since 2021 when a UK court stopped his extradition – prompting a back-and-forth in which Priti Patel stepped in to approve his extradition at one point. But the decision was made due to Assange’s ill health and his being a suicide risk – on the question of whether it was basically OK for journalists to be tried on espionage charges, the British judge sided with the US government. Assange has remained locked up ever since, as a series of appeals have indefinitely elongated the legal process. Ithaka might be more a part of the campaign to free Julian Assange than an objective report on it, but that it ends up as a woolly piece about kooky outsiders is an indictment in itself: a better film about effective activists does not exist. Meanwhile, Ithaka convincingly makes the case that Assange’s nearest and dearest are fighting their hopeless battle on behalf of us all. Ithaka: The Fight to Free Assange aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVX, and can be viewed on ABC iView in Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/manchester-arena-attack-nearly-a-third-of-young-survivors-have-not-had-professional-help","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"Manchester Arena attack: nearly a third of young survivors have not had professional help","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/manchester-arena-attack-nearly-a-third-of-young-survivors-have-not-had-professional-help","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/manchester-arena-attack-nearly-a-third-of-young-survivors-have-not-had-professional-help","fields":{"headline":"Manchester Arena attack: nearly a third of young survivors have not had professional help","bodyText":"Nearly one in three children and young people caught up in the Manchester Arena attack have not received any professional help, a study has found. A survey of 236 young people affected by the atrocity found that 29% had not had any psychological help, despite most feeling damaged by the blast six years ago. The vast majority of respondents said they needed support but 70% had no professional help within the first month and nearly one in three had nothing in the first year. Mhairi Sharp, the chief executive of the National Emergencies Trust, said the report exposed a “a glaring gap” in the understanding of how disasters affected children and young people. The report comes as the government is expected to publish a draft “survivor’s charter” in the coming weeks that will guarantee key rights for survivors of terror attacks. Nearly five years in the making, the charter is expected to include a guaranteed timeline for mental health support for victims. Twenty-two people died and hundreds more were injured when Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May 2017. Three-quarters of the 236 young people involved in the report said they had been psychologically damaged by the blast, while nearly one in five had been injured or had friends or family members injured. About 4% had lost a relative or friend. One young person who witnessed the attack said they felt “forgotten” because they had not been physically injured, despite suffering psychologically. Another recalled being told by a tutor to “take the attack as a positive experience – that this ‘hardship’ would make me a stronger person. He said not many young people experience hardships nowadays. This felt totally insensitive, so I didn’t return.” A third said: “I felt like being a survivor who was only injured mentally meant I had to explain how I felt and justify my thoughts as there were people a lot worse than me.” The study, called Bee the Difference, was led by the National Emergencies Trust and researchers at Lancaster University. It calls for public bodies to ensure early support is visible and the onus is not on victims to find it, and that specialised trauma help is available wherever they are based. The report urges professionals to understand that recovery can take time – one in four of the young people surveyed are still receiving psychological support – and that victims should be able to choose the right help for themselves. Cath Hill, of Lancaster University, the report’s lead author, said: “The findings show that the simple act of validating young people’s views can make a huge difference to their wellbeing, and is something all adults in positions of care could be more mindful of should the worst happen again. “Equally, introducing the option of an official survivor status for children’s school or college records could prevent them from having to relive their trauma time and again. I hope individuals and organisations reflect on the findings and think about how they could create change.” The Prince of Wales, a patron of the National Emergencies Trust, said the study made clear that “young people who have experienced the trauma of terrorism have needs unique to their age”. He added: “These are minds that need the space to have their voices heard and feelings acknowledged. We must listen to their stories now, in order to learn for the future. I look forward to seeing the change that it creates.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/i-was-completely-rejected-manchester-arena-survivor-recalls-struggle-to-get-therapy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"‘I was completely rejected’: Manchester Arena survivor recalls struggle to get therapy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/i-was-completely-rejected-manchester-arena-survivor-recalls-struggle-to-get-therapy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/i-was-completely-rejected-manchester-arena-survivor-recalls-struggle-to-get-therapy","fields":{"headline":"‘I was completely rejected’: Manchester Arena survivor recalls struggle to get therapy","bodyText":"Ellie Taylor had been looking forward to the Ariana Grande concert for months. It was a 15th birthday present from her mother and was perfectly timed – the day of her first GCSE exam. The date was 22 May 2017. Ellie, now 21, recalls shards of memory from that appalling day. She remembers watching Martyn Hett “living his best life” as he danced in Block 103 – he was a stranger at the time but she later recognised his face on the news. She had a gut feeling that something bad was going to happen, so she “grabbed my mum and her things” and they left halfway through the last song, Dangerous Woman. Then came the unmistakable sound of the explosion, which they heard from the car park. Their horrific journey home was punctured by reports of confirmed fatalities at Manchester Arena. Detectives later told Ellie that she and her mother had left the venue 90 seconds before the suicide bomb that killed 22 people and injured hundreds more. They had walked past the terrorist, Salman Abedi, at least once that night. Ellie is only able to tell her story after years of therapy. But receiving this help was an ordeal that made her original trauma “10 times worse”, she says. She returned to school the following day to “question after question”, and that week was moved to a room for disruptive children because she was talking about what happened. The school arranged for Ellie to see two counsellors, who came in four days after the bomb and asked her questions such as “How do you feel around blood?” and “How do you feel about the Arena?” Ellie was left “mortified” when her GP told her, “If I were you, I’d be struggling more,” and that it was going to take two years to enrol with Camhs [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services]. By then, “you’ll probably be fine”, the GP said, adding that it would be easier to get help “if you were anorexic or suicidal”. “I was completely rejected and invalidated. I was mortified and my mum was in complete and utter shock,” she says. Eventually, Ellie was able to start cognitive behavioural therapy – treatment that lasted two and a half years – and got her life back on track. It should have been far easier to receive that help, she says: “It was horrendous. I found myself in a terrorist attack which was so, so bad, but not being able to get the help made it 10 times worse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/chinas-war-chest-how-the-fight-for-semiconductors-reveals-the-outlines-of-a-future-conflict","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"China’s war chest: how the fight for semiconductors reveals the outlines of a future conflict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/chinas-war-chest-how-the-fight-for-semiconductors-reveals-the-outlines-of-a-future-conflict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/chinas-war-chest-how-the-fight-for-semiconductors-reveals-the-outlines-of-a-future-conflict","fields":{"headline":"China’s war chest: how the fight for semiconductors reveals the outlines of a future conflict","bodyText":"Signs of the burgeoning conflict between the US and China can be spotted in many different places, from balloons in the sky to videos on TikTok. But nowhere is it more apparent than on the microscopic wafers of silicon, otherwise known as semiconductors. Semiconductors, or microchips, are tiny pieces of technology that power everything from microwaves to military weapons. The industry is worth more than $580bn (£466bn), but even that figure belies their importance to the global economy. Their existence powers several trillion dollars’ worth of goods and processes; without them the global economy would shudder to a halt. It’s therefore a source of concern to many that over 90% of the world’s semiconductors are made in the place many US officials think could be the site of the next global conflict: Taiwan. If China were to annex Taiwan – which US officials believe could be attempted in the next decade – it, like the rest of the world, would find its supply of semiconductors massively disrupted. Beijing wants to boost its advanced semiconductor capacity so as to be more economically resilient in the event of an invasion, but also as a means of developing its military to be prepared for such a conflict. The US, however, is using the tools of international trade to undermine these efforts. China’s semiconductor industry went from having about 1,300 registered companies in 2011 to 22,800 by 2020, but the growth has been concentrated in manufacturers that produce chips that are bigger and less technologically advanced. The most up-to-date chips are five nanometers or smaller; China’s industry is mostly dominated by chips that are 24 nanometers or above. Last year, China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), the country’s biggest chip maker, was reported to have produced a 7-nanometer chip, which would represent a jump of two generations in terms of technological progress. But analysts doubt that SMIC would be able to produce these chips at scale and estimates suggest that China is a long way off its goal of being 70% self-sufficient in semiconductors by 2025. China’s ‘vulnerabilities’ The US wants to stop this from happening. Last year the Biden administration imposed a sweeping set of restrictions, including a measure to cut China off from chips made with US technology anywhere in the world. In March, the Netherlands confirmed it had joined an agreement with the US and Japan to restrict the export of advanced chip-making technology. The strategy seems to be working. In the first three months of 2023, China’s chip imports declined by 23% compared with the same period in the previous year. Beijing is thought to be preparing a 1trn yuan (£117bn/$146bn) support package for the semiconductor industry, which will include tax breaks or subsidies. “Faced with the new US export controls, China’s higher authorities have become more aware of the need to support firms in certain niches that are critical supply chain vulnerabilities,” says technology analyst John Lee. That could also mean penalising US competitors. On Sunday, China’s cybersecurity watchdog said that US company Micron, one of the world’s major chip manufacturers, had failed a national security review. “Operators of critical information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing Micron products,” the watchdog said. China’s broad definition of critical information infrastructure includes sectors ranging from transport to healthcare. When asked if the company will appeal the decision, a spokeswoman for Micron said: “We look forward to continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.” China’s leaders are also reforming the country’s technology strategy, following a shakeup that will give the Communist party more direct control over science and technology policy. But analysts think that cash alone will not be enough to turbo-charge China’s industry. The country’s leading semiconductor manufacturers are still decades behind the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Taiwan’s golden goose, and other rivals in the west, such as the Dutch ASML. As a proportion of overall sales, the Chinese semiconductor industry spends a far lower share on research and development than the US industry: 7.6% compared with 18% in the US, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, a US lobby group. The industry has also been plagued by entrepreneurs founding fraudulent operations in order to access government subsidies. In a bid to crackdown on this problem, last year the government revoked the licences of nearly 6,000 chip companies, an increase of nearly 70% on 2021. China’s technical challenges “require not just inventing the necessary equipment, chemicals and other inputs but also learning to use them efficiently and reliably at scale”, Lee says. “Years of R&amp;D and industry experience are probably still necessary” for Chinese companies to be able to scale production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/1227","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:00:39Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 1,227","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/1227","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/1227","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 1,227","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2023/may/22/last-of-the-seaside-cinema-organs-weston-super-mare-bids-adieu-to-its-compton","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:00:38Z","webTitle":"Last of the seaside cinema organs: Weston-super-Mare bids adieu to its Compton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/22/last-of-the-seaside-cinema-organs-weston-super-mare-bids-adieu-to-its-compton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/may/22/last-of-the-seaside-cinema-organs-weston-super-mare-bids-adieu-to-its-compton","fields":{"headline":"Last of the seaside cinema organs: Weston-super-Mare bids adieu to its Compton","bodyText":"For almost a century an extraordinary Compton theatre pipe organ has wowed audiences, local people and visitors alike, at the Odeon in the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare. But on Sunday its warm, mellow, nostalgic tones were being heard for the final time before the Somerset cinema’s closing. The British-made instrument and the modernist cinema are both listed, meaning that the organ, described on the town’s tourism website as a “wonder”, may be stranded behind closed doors and could never be fired up again. It is a melancholy moment for fans of the organ, which glows in pastel colours during performances, and spells the end of an era as Weston’s instrument is the last of the seaside cinema Comptons operating in the original setting. Once there were about 260 Comptons in UK cinemas but after Sunday there will be only two still being played in the place they were intended for – the Odeon in Leicester Square, central London, and the Plaza in Stockport, Greater Manchester. Michael Wooldridge, who played the organ at a farewell concert on Sunday, said listening to a cinema organ in its intended setting was very special. “The nature of the space creates a very warm sound. There’s a special magic to it.” Wooldridge’s programme included hits from 1935 – when the organ was first played – Buddy Holly tunes and Eurovision favourites. “The idea is to take people on a musical and emotional journey,” he said. Ben Snowdon, of the Cinema Organ Society, said Weston’s Compton was arguable the most authentic of the survivors. “If the John Compton company went in there now, they would see an organ that looks exactly as it did when it was installed. It is so original it is untrue,” he said. Snowdon, one of the enthusiasts who has looked after the organ over the years, said Odeon had committed to a maintenance programme. “But I don’t know what will happen to the building. We hope, at least, the organ will have a good send-off on Sunday. It’s very sad.” Cinema organs were built to provide accompaniment for silent films. When the talkies came in they were used to provide entertainment before the screening, during interludes and for shows in their own right. Weston’s organ was first played in May 1935 by Alfred Richards, who composed the song Around the Corner at the Odeon for the occasion. Ironically, cinema organs have enjoyed a modest renaissance. The Curzon in Clevedon, Somerset, has installed a Christie organ while in east London, the Troxy, a former cinema transformed into a multi-use events space, has brought in a Wurlitzer pipe organ. Musicians like Wooldridge still tour the country playing cinema organs, but in spaces such as town halls where the sound – and vibe – is different. The Odeon has lost business to a new multiplex and said it is closing its Weston outpost because the business is “not viable”, but has not said what will happen to the building. Among those attending on Sunday was Jo Lucas, 84, chair of the Weston Organ &amp; Keyboard Club, who has enjoyed listening to the organ since she arrived in the seaside town 20 years ago. “I’m worried about that lovely organ,” she said. “It’s a beautiful thing with those flashing lights. I remember the days when you had half an hour or an hour of music before the film began. “Now people can sit at home watching films and they don’t have to go out and pay for a cinema ticket. I shall be there on Sunday crying with everyone else.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2023/may/21/us-pga-championship-2023-final-day-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"US PGA Championship 2023: Brooks Koepka wins third title – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/may/21/us-pga-championship-2023-final-day-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2023/may/21/us-pga-championship-2023-final-day-live","fields":{"headline":"US PGA Championship 2023: Brooks Koepka wins third title – as it happened","bodyText":"Ewan Murray was at Oak Hill, and his verdict has landed.

He raises his PGA-engraved vase in the air to wild cheering. “It hasn’t sunk in yet to be honest,” says Block. “It’s pretty cool.” This is Brooks Koepka’s fifth major title. One more now than Rory McIlroy … who stops to give him a hug and, with a genuine smile, say “I’m really happy for you.” A class act.

Brooks likes fast play, so he doesn’t faff about. His birdie putt doesn’t drop, but does he care? Nope! He taps in, then punches the air: “Yes! Yes!” He embraces his caddy, commiserates with Hovland, and flings his ball into the gallery. “Hell yeah! Let’s go! That’s what I’m talkin’ about!” -9: Koepka -7: Scheffler, Hovland This final round has already served up several memorable moments, and here’s another! Viktor Hovland pours in his left-to-right curler for birdie, and though his smile is bittersweet right now, that means he’ll have a share of second place. It would have been heartbreaking for him to finish third after all of his efforts. A 68 and he ends the week at -7. Viktor Hovland stripes one down 18. Brooks Koepka follows. Hovland knocks his second to 20 feet. Koepka pings his pin high to six feet … then walks up to receive the sort of reception his talent deserves. Love pouring down from the gallery. It’s a long way from the boos on the 1st tee box yesterday! Block then points out another advantage of his automatic qualification next year. “It gives another PGA professional a spot, because I’m an exempt, so I’ve got another guy in, which is rad to me.” What a gentleman! Is it raining in your face too? Michael Block speaks to Sky Sports. “My game came to Rochester which is really cool … I played my normal game … I’ve never done it for four rounds before but finally I’ve done it and that’s off my check-off list … I did not see the hole-in-one go in … I thought it may be pretty close … then Rory turns around and said ‘that went in the hole!’ … I said ‘you gotta be kidding me’ … I had no idea … zero clue … why is Rory hugging me?! … you don’t hug me for hitting it close, so then I thought ‘I think I made it!’ … for me to go back [to Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club] will be a very special thing … the money is going to be fun and great to have for my family, but I didn’t do this for the money … I’m going to go home, the happiest guy in the world!” Hovland does extremely well to get up and down from the rough, 100 yards out. Par, while Koepka takes two calm putts for a bogey. Barring a strange meltdown, he’s one hole away from his third PGA Championship title! -9: Koepka (17) -7: Scheffler (F) -6: Hovland (17) Rory talks to Sky. “I feel sort of close but also so far away at the same time, it’s a really weird feeling … I know I need to be better.” Wild tee shots at 17. Brooks right, Hovland left. Hovland can only hack his second further up the rough. Brooks takes his medicine and chips out. Meanwhile up on 18, Scottie Scheffler makes birdie and signs for a 65. He’s the new clubhouse leader at -7 … and with Koepka now more likely than not to bogey 17, this isn’t quite over yet. It’s nearly over. But not quite. -10: Koepka (16) -7: Scheffler (F) -6: Hovland (16) Here’s what Michael Block gets for his 70-70-70-71. He qualifies for next year’s PGA Championship. He’s earned nearly $300,000. He’s got stories to tell for the rest of his life. “You made it great,” he tells Rory McIlroy in the scorer’s hut. Then he sweetly asks someone to take a picture of him with McIlroy. A fan as well as a fantastic player. Two putts for Viktor Hovland at 16. A double-bogey six, and he walks off knowing this is over. Brooks Koepka tidies up for his birdie. His second shot there was outstanding, worthy of winning any tournament … but Hovland’s bunker fiasco will provide the defining images. -10: Koepka (16) -6: Scheffler (17), Hovland (16) Michael Block sends his par putt straight at the cup. The ball threatens to stop on the edge, but it’s such a tease and it finally drops. The gallery erupts! They won’t get any louder when the winner is identified. Rory McIlroy smiles the widest smile and throws open his arms as he embraces the slightly disbelieving club professional. Block puts one hand on his heart, points at his new fans, spins around to acknowledge them all, and then gives his partner a hug. A 71 and a +1 finish. Unbelievable. A proper golfing fairytale! (Par meanwhile for Rory and a 69. He’s -2. Another near miss, but despite his disappointment, he’s clearly enjoyed Block’s company today.) Meanwhile back on 16, a sequence unfolds that has probably decided the destiny of the Wanamaker Trophy. Hovland drops on the bank, taking his medicine by punching out into the fairway. He’s hit four, and then Koepka lashes his second to a couple of feet. That’s some proper carpe-diem golf! Hovland sends his approach straight at the flag, but he’ll be aware the jig is nearly up. Up on 18, Michael Block sends his drive into rough down the right, then his second into the gallery to the left of the green. But he’s got a good lie, and he wedges crisply up the bank, over the bunker, and softly onto the green. He’ll have a ten-foot look to save par! Hovland does exactly the same thing Conners did yesterday! He slams his iron straight into the bank, where it plugs. This is almost a frame-for-frame retelling of last night! Hovland looks ahead at his buried ball, aghast, and smiles the wryest smile of his life. He knows that could have cost him the PGA Championship; Connors ran up a double bogey yesterday. Here comes the referee to sort out where he can drop. Sport can be so, so strange sometimes. And so very, very cruel. Viktor Hovland sends his drive at 16 into the bunker Corey Conners had so much trouble with yesterday evening. Brooks Koepka’s tee shot flies that bunker but ends up in the rough. Up on 17, Scottie Scheffler finds the green in regulation but he’s a long way from the flag. Not ideal when he’s desperate for birdies. The crowd goes wild for Michael Block again, this time at 17. That’s after his getting down from 100 yards to scramble a par. He remains at +1. One final birdie, and he’ll be signing for his fourth round of 70. Golfing gods, make it happen! Par for Rory (-2). Koepka putts first. A gentle left-to-right slider. It doesn’t quite get there, and it was always destined to miss on the right, but he’s happy enough to tap home for par. Hovland’s takes a similar route, and he makes do with par as well. Meanwhile up on 16, Scheffler hits an uphill 20-foot birdie putt that never looks like dropping. Par. As you all were, then … except the leader Brooks Koepka is one hole closer to home! -9: Koepka (15) -8: Hovland (15) -6: Scheffler (16) To Block’s hole. Hovland sends his tee shot pin high, but a good 30 feet to the left. Koepka follows him there, a couple of feet further left. He’ll give Hovland a read. Meanwhile on 16, there’s the inevitable comedown for Michael Block, whose drive finds thick rough. His second flies through the back, and though he gives himself half a chance of saving par with a neat lob from the bottom of a swale, it’s a bogey. He drops to +1, but he’ll always have the 15th. He’ll always have Oak Hill. Koepka sends a slightly clumsy putt four feet past the hole. In mitigation, he was putting through the fringe with his feet slightly down the bank. Hovland then pours in his birdie putt; that was far from a certainty. He’s refusing to allow Koepka to shake him off. Koepka makes his birdie, but not for the first time today, Hovland will be walking off a hole happy to have equalled his opponent’s score despite tee shots of vastly differing quality. -9: Koepka (14) -8: Hovland (14) -6: Scheffler (15) Brooks Koepka launches a driver at 14 onto the green. His ball thinks about toppling off, but stops on the fringe, and he’ll have a look at eagle from 20 feet or so. Viktor Hovland’s tee shot sits on the bank, from where he chips to eight feet. Meanwhile Scottie Scheffler, having parred Michael Block’s hole, crashes a drive down the middle of 16. A birdie blitz! Corey Conners, who had fallen off the radar after bogeys at 12 and 13, rattles in a long putt on 14 to return to -2. Justin Rose sinks a tramliner on 15 to return to -2. Bryson DeChambeau follows Conners in from a much shorter distance to rise to -3. “That was a proper hole in one,” writes Adam Hirst of Michael Block’s moment of history. “The only one that I’ve ever seen. In without even a bounce, that’s how it should be done, none of that rolling around the green nonsense. Thing of absolute beauty.” It. Is. All. Happening. Brooks Koepka elects to putt from the apron at 13. He sends his effort four feet past. A nerve-jangler. Viktor Hovland turns up the pressure by making his birdie putt. Koepka responds by rattling in the par saver. Meanwhile up on 14, Scottie Scheffler makes his birdie to stay on the leaders’ tail. (Bogey for Rory McIlroy on 15, by the way, in non-Michael-Block-related news.) -8: Koepka (13) -7: Hovland (13) -6: Scheffler (14) -3: Davis (F), Kitayama (F) -2: Straka (F), Perez (16), McIlroy (15), DeChambeau (13) … so while that bedlam was unfolding, Scottie Scheffler hit the flagstick at 13 before tapping home for birdie. He’s -5. Coming behind, Viktor Hovland sends his second down the middle of the fairway, then chips to 12 feet. Brooks Koepka’s wedge spins back off the front of the green, and everything feels a little psychedelic right now. Golf: bloody hell! Did that just happen? Yes. Yes it did. As if the 46-year-old club pro’s story wasn’t enough of a fairytale! He sends a 7-iron from 151 yards into the par-three 15th … and his ball disappears straight into the cup! No bounce, no roll, straight into the hole without touching the sides! The crowd go ballistic, but he can’t quite process what’s happened. “Did that go in?” he asks Rory McIlroy. It takes him a while to realise he’s just aced in the most sensational manner! “No! No! No way!” Rory congratulates him warmly … then the showman in Block comes out as he writes and circles the figure 1 on his scorecard for the benefit of the CBS cameras! (“You ready for this one?!”) That truly is a moment for the ages. He’s level par! Koepka pings his drive at the long par-five 13th down the right-hand side of the fairway. Hovland pulls his viciously to the left, and the ball looks to be heading towards some concession tents. But it hits a tree and pings back into the rough. He’ll have lost plenty of distance but that’s something of a break for Hovland. But never mind that, because … A big mistake by Rory McIlroy on 14. He drives into a bunker at the front, then splashes six feet past the flag. He gets a read from his playing partner Michael Block, whose putt from almost exactly the same spot breaks to the right. But Rory learns nothing, and his putt does exactly the same thing. Just a par on a hole where some players have been making eagle. Birdie, the more realistic goal, was necessary, though, given the state of play. He then sends his tee shot at 15 down the swale to the right of the par-three, and you’d have to say his race is run. He’s -3. Scottie Scheffler very nearly seriously shakes things up on 13, where he’s this close to holing out for eagle. A wedge in from 80 yards lands ten feet past the flag then spins back, almost shaving the lip. He’s happy enough with birdie, though, and he’s just two back at -5. Er, hold on, scrub that, make it three back, because on 12, Brooks Koepka makes birdie in the fuss-free fashion, wedging to ten feet and pouring in the putt. Viktor Hovland can’t match him from similar distance, and that’s a huge match-play style swing. -8: Koepka (12) -6: Hovland (12) -4: Scheffler (12) Bogeys for Bryson DeChambeau and Corey Conners on the short par-four 12th. Both punished for errant drives. Both drop to -2. Both walk off with the air of men who know that, unless something wild and wonderful is about to happen, the jig is almost certainly up. Here comes another one of those too-little, too-late charges by Rory McIlroy! Two big bashes down 13 followed by a wedge to five feet, and it’s another birdie. He rises to -3, and yes that bold text is deliberately designed to tempt fate. Meanwhile back on 11, Brooks Koepka powers a magnificent shot out of the bunker, where he’s right up against the lip, to 12 feet. No idea how he managed to get that as close as he did! But he can’t make the par saver, which lips out on the left. A two-putt par for Hovland, and the gap at the top is once again just the one. Meanwhile par at the last for Kurt Kitayama, and he’s the latest player to shoot 65 today. He joins Cam Davis in the clubhouse lead. -7: Koepka (11) -6: Hovland (11) -4: Scheffler (12) -3: Davis (F), Kitayama (F), McIlroy (13), DeChambeau (11), Conners (11) The monster par-three 11th is playing at 246 yards today. Brooks Koepka draws a 4-iron … and his ball dunks in the bunker front left. He’s right up against the face. Viktor Hovland elects to use a 3-iron instead, and finds the heart of the green. Koepka should be able to get his ball up and out, but how far he’ll be able to advance it is another issue altogether. Cam Davis leaves a straight birdie putt on 18 one turn short. But he’s still signing for a final round of 65, matching the feats of Cameron Smith and Sepp Straka, and installing him as the new clubhouse leader at -3. Hovland gives his birdie effort a good run. For a while it looks like heading in, dead straight, but there’s a little right-hand turn at the end and it slides by. He smiles wryly, knowing exactly what’s about to happen. Koepka rolls in his putt for birdie, opening up a two-stroke lead, and perhaps more importantly steadying a ship that was listing ever so slightly. What moxie! -8: Koepka (10) -6: Hovland (10) Brooks Koepka has been shaky for the last hour or so. But on 10 he sends in a steadier. A wedge clipped from 140 yards to six feet. By contrast, Viktor Hovland’s pin-high effort, 25 feet wide left, is distinctly average. A big chance here for Brooks to open up a cushion again at the top. OK, so the last group has hit the turn on Sunday. That being the case … welcome to the start of the 2023 PGA Championship! Brooks Koepka and Viktor Hovland both hit fine drives down 10. Meanwhile a big birdie for Cam Davis on 17, reward for sending his second from 180 yards to ten feet. Back-to-back bogeys for Justin Rose, though, at 10 and 11, and at -1 his race is surely run. -7: Koepka (9) -6: Hovland (9) -4: Scheffler (11) -3: Davis (17), Kitayama (16), Conners (10), DeChambeau (10) -2: Straka (F), Perez (13), McIlroy (12) Viktor Hovland’s Achilles heel used to be his chipping. No longer, not today. Magical chips at 1 and 8, and now another at 9. He drops his club gently on the ball, allowing it to dink out of the rough and land softly on the green, where it works its way down towards the hole. Three feet away, and he’s even left himself an uphill par saver. In it goes, and this is some really entertaining street-fighting golf. A two-putt par for Brooks, and here’s how they hit the turn … -7: Koepka (9) -6: Hovland (9) A big break for Brooks, who does indeed find himself with a decent trodden-down lie. It allows him to power an 8-iron into the front of the green, though he’ll have a long putt for birdie. Hovland then flies a 7-iron over the green. He’ll have a tricky chip back from thick rubbish, and downhill to boot, in the trademark Donald Ross style. Meanwhile a bounce-back birdie for Scottie Scheffler at 10, where Justin Rose yips a tiddler to drop a stroke, while Sepp Straka matches Cam Smith’s 65 to take the clubhouse lead. -7: Koepka (8) -6: Hovland (8) -4: Scheffler (10), DeChambeau (9) -3: Kitayama (15), Conners (9) -2: Straka (F), Davis (16), Perez (12), McIlroy (11), Rose (10) Are those Confidence Demons beginning to bother Brooks Koepka again? Two bogeys followed by a very conservatively played par, and now he’s sent his tee shot at 9 into the gallery down the left. A fair chance he’ll get a decent lie given it’s where the punters have been perched all week. Meanwhile Viktor Hovland splits the fairway. Up ahead, Scottie Scheffler bogeys the hole, the punishment for an errant drive. A warning for Brooks perhaps. Scheffler drops to -3. Tyrrell Hatton signs for a 67. He ends the week at +1, and that opening round of 77 – specifically that front nine of 42 – may give him nightmares for a while. He’d have been right in the mix otherwise. Back-to-back birdies for Rory McIlroy. He wedges his approach at 10 to six feet and rolls in the putt. He moves to -2, just five off the lead. Back on 8, Viktor Hovland again finds deep rough from the tee. He powers his second towards the green, but the ball topples into the thick stuff around the fringe. He’s not got a lot of green to work with, but fashions a lovely little dink that nearly drops for an outrageous birdie. He’ll happily take that par, though, and remains at -6. A garden-variety par for Brooks Koepka, meanwhile, to stem the bleeding. He avoids a third consecutive bogey to stay one clear at -7. News of Michael Block. The club pro hits the turn in 37, having bogeyed 1 and 7 en route. He’s +2 and going along very nicely. Meanwhile back on 8, Bryson DeChambeau, having dropped a stroke at 7, makes bounce-back birdie to return to -4. You wait ages for a second eagle of the week at the short par-four 14th … then a third comes along in the London-bus style. Cam Davis whistles a stunning tee shot straight at the flag, a dart to seven feet, and in goes the putt. The 28-year-old Aussie, who tied for sixth at the Players a couple of months ago, moves to -2. Viktor Hovland hoicks a driving iron into the filth down the right of 7. Brooks Koepka splits the fairway. But then he inexplicably sends his approach wide right of the green. He’s left with an awkward shot, feet in a bunker, ball above him on a bank. His chip on is weak and he’s left with a 40-foot putt for his par. He can’t make it, and that’s a bogey. Meanwhile Hovland was forced to take his medicine and hack out of the rough. He sends his third into the heart of the green, giving himself half a chance of scrambling par from 20 feet. He can’t make it, but he’d have taken this outcome after those tee shots. Koepka lets his opponent off with a big one there. -7: Koepka (7) -6: Hovland (7) -4: Scheffler (8) -3: Rose (8), DeChambeau (7) Scottie Scheffler and Justin Rose pepper the flag at 8 … but only Scheffler is able to make the short birdie putt he’s left with. He rises to -4 while Rose stays stuck at -3 having lipped out. Another birdie for Kurt Kitayama, this time at 13, where he nearly holed out from 120 yards for eagle. He’s -3. And birdie for Rory McIlroy at 9 … but he’d dropped a stroke at 7 and so turns in level-par 35. He’s -1 after an erratic front nine. Cameron Smith nails a 15-foot par saver on the last, and he smiles warmly as he shakes hands on a best-of-week 65. The Open champion is the new clubhouse leader at -1. Patrick Cantlay crashes his tee shot at the risk-and-reward short par-four 14th onto the right-hand fringe of the green. He then drains a 40-foot putt for only the second eagle of the week on this hole! He rises to -1. Bogey for Cameron Smith on 17, meanwhile, though he’s still on course for a best-of-week 65 should he par the last. Hovland splashes out of the bunker but leaves himself a tricky ten-footer for par. Koepka lags up from distance and will escape with bogey. A big putt for Hovland, then, who won’t want to match Koepka’s score having hit a perfect 3-wood from the tee while his opponent found the reeds. So there’s a spring in his step when he rams the putt into the centre of the cup and plucks the ball back out. A huge par, and the lead is suddenly just one. -8: Koepka (5) -7: Hovland (5) -4: DeChambeau (6), Conners (6) A late charge up the leaderboard by Sepp Straka. Birdies at 10, 13, 14 and now 15, and the 30-year-old Austrian is -3. Victor Perez meanwhile responds to those back-to-back bogeys with birdie at 9. He’s out in 32 and -2 overall. And Scottie Scheffler finally makes a putt; his first birdie of the day, at 7, moves him up to -3. The referee suggests Koepka’s ball has ended up in the reeds that did for slapstick artiste Tom Kim on Thursday evening. Official and player are now debating exactly where the ball crossed. While they work that out, Hovland sends his second into the bunker to the right of the green. Koepka eventually drops, then batters his third onto the back of the green. Two putts and he’ll escape with a bogey that’ll feel like a win. Especially if Hovland can’t get up and down from the sand. Viktor Hovland crashes his drive down the right-hand side of the 6th fairway. Then Brooks Koepka sends a big slice wide right. The camera loses track of the ball. It didn’t look like it was heading for the creek, and he might even get a break on some grass trodden down by the gallery … but nothing’s confirmed yet. He could also be in deep filth. More news when we have it. Another couple of big birdie putts drop elsewhere. Justin Rose curls one on 6 to move to -4; Cameron Smith wedges from 140 yards to seven feet at 16 and tidies up to rise to -2. This almost certainly won’t be enough for the Open champion, but he’s on course to set a clubhouse total that will give quite a large proportion of the field food for thought. Brooks Koepka’s putt at 5, a gentle downhill left-to-right slider, looks like heading in. But it drifts too far to the right on its final turn. No fourth consecutive birdie for Brooks. Just – just! – a par. So a tiny window of opportunity cracks open for Viktor Hovland … and he clambers through it, pouring his left-to-right curler in for birdie to close the gap at the top to two strokes! -9: Koepka (5) -7: Hovland (5) At the par-three 5th, Corey Conners shoves his tee shot down the bank to the right and short-sides himself. He chips up to ten feet, but gives his birdie straight back to the field. He slips to -4, where he’s joined by his playing partner Bryson DeChambeau heading the other way. A lovely iron to four feet earns Bryson his birdie. Once they vacate the green, Brooks Koepka sets up another birdie chance from 15 feet. Viktor Hovland, now dealing with added matchplay-style pressure, does extremely well to give himself a similar opportunity. A couple of big putts coming up! Viktor Hovland eases a gentle wedge into 4, spinning the ball back close like Corey Conners did before him. It leads to his first birdie of the day. Only problem being, Brooks Koepka is unstoppable right now, and matches him stroke for stroke. The gap at the top remains three, but at least the Norwegian is maintaining some sort of chase. A second consecutive bogey for Victor Perez, meanwhile, at 8, the latest man to illustrate how there’s no future at Oak Hill if you don’t find the fairway. -9: Koepka (4) -6: Hovland (4) -5: Conners (4) -3: Rose (5), DeChambeau (4) -2: Scheffler (5) -1: Smith (15), Straka (13), Kitayama (10), Perez (8), McIlroy (6) Rory McIlroy may as well go for broke. He aims for the flag at the treacherous long par-four 6th, tucked beside the creek. He lands his ball pin high, then rolls in the right-to-left slider from 12 feet for birdie. He’s back into the red at -1. The Open champion Cameron Smith builds on that early momentum. Birdies at 13 and 14 whisk him up to -1. On the long par-five 4th, Corey Conners wedges into the heart of the green from 102 yards, spinning his ball back to three feet. A chance to repair the damage of the previous hole. In it goes. But bogey at 7 for Victor Perez, who wasn’t able to take on the creek crossing the fairway after finding the long stuff from the tee. -8: Koepka (3) -5: Conners (4), Hovland (3) -3: Rose (5), DeChambeau (4) -2: Perez (7), Scheffler (4) Hovland gives his putt a good run, but it’s never dropping. Just a par. Koepka tidies up for his second birdie in a row, and right now he looks as though he’s in the mood to banish the demons that saw him drift pensively through that Netflix documentary and subsequently jiggered his Masters bid. This is awesome stuff. -8: Koepka (3) -5: Hovland (3) -4: Conners (3) -3: Perez (6), Rose (3), DeChambeau (3) -2: Scheffler (3) A couple of big US stars making a late tilt for the title. Patrick Reed birdies 1, 3 and 6 and is currently -1 through 7; Patrick Cantlay guides a left-to-right slider in from 20 feet on 10 to join him at -1, having previously birdied 2, 4 and 9. But the biggest US star of all right now is Brooks Koepka, and he’s just eased his tee shot at the 212-yard par-three 3rd to four feet. Viktor Hovland will have a look at birdie from 20 feet, but the field are in danger of being left behind in Koepka’s dust if they’re not careful. The first significant move at the top. Brooks Koepka and Viktor Hovland pepper the flag at 2. Hovland misses his downhill four-foot tickler, the ball breaking right like Scottie Scheffler before him, but Koepka’s effort is straighter and in it goes for birdie. Meanwhile a three-putt bogey for Rory McIlroy at 4 – he slips to level par – and a poor bunker shot at 3 costs Corey Conners a shot at 3. -7: Koepka (2) -5: Hovland (2) -4: Conners (3) -3: Perez (6), Rose (3), DeChambeau (2) -2: Scheffler (3) Jordan Spieth nearly rakes in a monster across 18 for birdie. But par will have to do. He signs for a final-day 69, a fine round slightly sullied by a double bogey at 17. He’s +5 and the career grand slam will have to wait another year. Meanwhile a fine up and down from distance by Corey Conners at 2. He’d pulled his tee shot into a fairway bunker, necessitating a chip out. But he wedged from 100 yards to three feet, and remains at -5. A word on Scottie Scheffler’s putter. It’s been cold all weekend, and the early signs suggest it’s refusing to warm up. After that lip-out at 1, he sent his second at 2 to four feet, only for the birdie putt to turn apologetically to the right. Now a medium-range birdie effort on 3 refuses to drop. The world number two and Players champion remains at -2 … but if he can get anything at all going on the greens, watch out field. A garden variety par for Brooks Koepka at 1. A much more impressive one for Viktor Hovland, whose drive ended up in thick rough. He powered out, his ball rolling down the swale to the back of the green, about the best he could do with no spin control. He bundles a chip back up to six feet, then makes his par putt. What a scramble after that poor opening drive. A flat-out refusal to start cold. -6: Koepka (1) -5: Conners (1), Hovland (1) -3: Perez (5), Rose (2), DeChambeau (1) -2: Scheffler (2) -1: Reed (6), McIlroy (3) Bogey on the cards? Nah! Rose dinks a little chip onto the 2nd green and finds the cup. He remains at -3 … where he’s joined by Victor Perez, who knocks his tee shot at 5 to six feet and makes the putt for a fourth birdie in a row! Meanwhile bogey for Jon Rahm at 18. That’s his week in microcosm. A 71, and the world number one and Masters champion ends the week at +7. There was never any coming back from that opening round of 76. Opening pars for DeChambeau and Conners. But trouble for Rose at 2, as he ends up in the bunker guarding the front right of the green. He’s short sided, and tries to get too cute with his splash out. His ball only just squirts out of the trap, and nestles in the rough surrounding the green. Bogey on the cards. The 54-hole leader Brooks Koepka takes to the tee. Like Bryson before him, he gets a much better reception today. He certainly deserves it. He’s been outrageously good this week. He creams his opening drive down the right-hand side of the fairway. Then it’s Viktor Hovland’s turn … and his ball disappears in the thick rough down the right. That’s it, then! Everyone’s out and about! Let’s play some golf! A fast start too by Victor Perez. The 30-year-old from the Pyrenees has birdied 2, 3 and 4 to whizz up to -2. Back on 1, Scottie Scheffler’s birdie putt horseshoes out at a weirdly glacial pace. How did that not drop? The big man looks befuddled. And on 2, McIlroy can’t save his par. A decent chip up to ten feet, but the putt’s always staying up on the high side. Immediate deflation. -6: Koepka -5: Hovland, Conners -3: Rose (1), DeChambeau -2: Perez (4), Scheffler (1) -1: McIlroy (2) Corey Conners, looking to become only the second Canadian to win a men’s major, after 2003 Masters winner Mike Weir, whistles his opening drive down the middle. Then up steps Bryson DeChambeau, who gets a much warmer reception than the boo-soaked outrage of yesterday … though there are still a few grumbles from the gallery. Poor Bryson, we can’t all be exactly the same. Undeterred, he cracks his drive down the fairway. Meanwhile up on the green, Justin Rose makes like Rory earlier, tapping in for birdie after sticking his approach close. He’s up to -3. Disappointment for McIlroy at 2. He takes an iron from the tee to put himself in prime position, only to send his approach wide right of the green. He’s down the side of a thickly covered hill, and short-sided to boot. He’ll do well to get close from there. Par the dream, bogey more likely. Kurt Kitayama has hovered around the upper echelons of the leaderboard all week, without ever quite inserting himself into the picture. Rounds of 70, 71 and 71. But the 30-year-old Californian, who won his first PGA Tour title a couple of months ago at the Arnold Palmer International, is off to a flyer today. Birdies at 1, 4 and now 5 have zipped him up the standings and into red figures. He’s -1. Block gives himself the chance of salvaging birdie by wedging into the centre of the green and spinning his ball back to ten feet. But he can’t make the par saver. It slides by on the right and that’s an opening bogey for the last man standing of the Team of 20. Rory taps in for his birdie, and well, here we go. -6: Koepka -5: Hovland, Conners -3: DeChambeau -2: McIlroy (1), Rose, Scheffler An awkward lie in the rough for Block, who has to stand with one foot in a bunker and chip back out onto the fairway. But what a start for Rory, who from 144 yards fires straight at the pin to 18 inches! He’ll kick that one in for the fastest of starts. He’s going to be -2 in a couple of shakes. Callum Tarren was shaping up to be one of those big stories after opening rounds of 71 and 67. But he tumbled down the standings yesterday, a miserable front nine of 42 leading to a hope-ending 79. But he’s finished with a flourish today: a second sub-70 round of the week. Today’s 68 would have been even better had it not been for an unfortunate triple-bogey at 16. The 32-year-old from Darlington may or may not have done enough to top his previous best appearance at a major – he tied for 31st at last year’s US Open at Brookline, and is currently tied for 33rd here – but whatever happens, that’s a fine PGA Championship debut nonetheless. He ends his week at +5. Michael Block is one of the stories – and perhaps the story – of this 105th PGA Championship. One of the PGA Team of 20 club professionals in this year’s field, he’s the only one to have made the cut. That’s an achievement in itself, but carding three consecutive rounds of 70 is on another level altogether. The 46-year-old from Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club in southern California takes to the tee for the final round with two-time winner Rory McIlroy, and he’s clearly in the mood to enjoy every single moment of this, having turned up at the course four hours ago to mingle with his new legion of fans. Good on him. There won’t be a single person at Oak Hill wishing him anything but the best of luck. Winning is probably beyond him … but a top-ten finish isn’t … or even a top-four-and-ties finish for a place at next year’s Masters! A huge roar greets him before he bashes his first drive down the track. He finds the rough down the right. McIlroy splits the fairway. Godspeed Michael Block. Justin Thomas finished the defence of his title with a round of 72. He ends the week at +12. In a neat twist of fate, he went round today with Phil Mickelson, the 2021 champion, who didn’t get to defend last year as a result of flapping his gums too loudly re LIV and the Saudis. So he was defending his crown as well this week, sort of, if you apply the logic of an elite sports star, because that’s certainly the way he’ll have been thinking about it. Nice that they played together today, then, as they took their leave of the stage. Lefty left in style, too, with a birdie at 18 that gave him a best-of-week 70. He ended up at +10. Kazuki Higa made the first birdie of this year’s tournament on Thursday morning at the par-three 11th. The 28-year-old from Japan, making his PGA Championship debut, then went on to birdie 12, 13 and 14 and led for a few hours. But that was as good as it got. He ended the first day with a 72, followed that up with 73 and 77, and this morning shot 80 to end the week propping up the leaderboard at +20. A shame, but then again he can now always say he once led a major championship, which is something he wasn’t able to do this time last week. A storming start for Sepp Straka as well. The big Austrian has opened with birdies at 1, 2 and 5, to whistle 12 places up the standings and into the top ten. Any old excuse to update the leaderboard for the first time this afternoon. -6: Koepka -5: Hovland, Conners -3: DeChambeau -2: Rose, Scheffler -1: McIlroy E: Straka (5), Lee (2), Block, Suh +1: Smith (7), Svensson (5), Cantlay (4), Kitayama (3), Reed (2), Cole (1), Fleetwood, Perez, Jaeger, Lowry +2: Lowry (1) After yesterday’s deluge, the calm. It’s sunny and serene in Rochester, and while Oak Hill’s fancy new computerised drainage system has sucked away most of yesterday’s downpour, the course is playing a little softer, and therefore there’s an opportunity for someone to shoot low. Case study one: Adam Scott, who birdied 5, 6, 8 and 12 this morning and was the perfect example until making bogey at 15. He’s three under for his round, though, and +3 overall. Case study two: the Open champion Cameron Smith, who has just flown out of the traps with birdies at 2, 3, 4 and 6 … then bogeyed 7. Bah. But you get the general point. He’s also three under for his round today, after a mere seven holes, and has whisked himself up the standings to +1 in double-quick time. All good news for the chasing pack … as well as the leader Brooks Koepka, of course, and he was capable of a 66 in yesterday’s rain, so if he really fancies it today, all bets are off. Or will he fold again like he did on Masters Sunday? Yes, well anything’s possible, but the way he’s playing this week, you wouldn’t bet the farm on it happening again. After posting back-to-back 66s, Brooks Koepka is in pole position to win his third PGA Championship. Should he do so, the 2018 and 2019 champion would become just the third player in the tournament’s stroke-play era to lift the Wanamaker Trophy three times, up there with Jack and Tiger. So no biggie. But there are a few players who will have something to say about that: Viktor Hovland and Corey Conners, chasing their first major; Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Rose and Scottie Scheffler, hoping for their second; Rory McIlroy, looking for that elusive fifth. All of which sets up a super Sunday of golf. It’s on! Here’s how the top of the leaderboard looked after 54 holes … -6: Koepka -5: Hovland, Conners -3: DeChambeau -2: Rose, Scheffler -1: McIlroy E: Block, Suh +1: Fleetwood, Perez, Jaeger, Cole, Lowry, Lee +2: Reed, Kitayama, Fox, Davis … and these are today’s tee-times. 12.50pm: Ben Taylor, Mark Hubbard 1pm: Joel Dahmen, Kazuki Higa 1.10pm: Taylor Montgomery, Taylor Moore 1.20pm: Phil Mickelson, Justin Thomas 1.30pm: Rikuya Hoshino, Lee Hodges 1.40pm: Sihwan Kim, Zach Johnson 1.50pm: Padraig Harrington, Matt Wallace 2pm: Adrian Meronk, Pablo Larrazabal 2.10pm: Thomas Detry, Tony Finau 2.20pm: Callum Tarren, Yannik Paul 2.30pm: Max Homa, JT Poston 2.40pm: Patrick Rodgers, Thriston Lawrence 2.50pm: KH Lee, Patrick Rodgers 3.10pm: Adam Hadwin, Adam Scott 3.20pm: Sam Stevens, Nicolai Hojgaard 3.30pm: Tom Hoge, Lucas Herbert 3.40pm: Dean Burmester, Jon Rahm 3.50pm: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth 4pm: Harold Varner III, Mito Pereira 4.10pm: Collin Morikawa, Beau Hossler 4.20pm: Xander Schauffele, Chez Reavie 4.30pm: Alex Smalley, Thomas Pieters 4.40pm: Keegan Bradley, Matt NeSmith 5pm: Cameron Smith, Hayden Buckley 5.10pm: Tyrrell Hatton, Chris Kirk 5.20pm: Keith Mitchell, Taylor Pendrith 5.30pm: Adam Svensson, Sepp Straka 5.40pm: Sahith Theegala, Patrick Cantlay 5.50pm: Cam Davis, Hideki Matsuyama 6pm: Kurt Kitayama, Ryan Fox 6.10pm: Min Woo Lee, Patrick Reed 6.20pm: Eric Cole, Shane Lowry 6.30pm: Stephan Jaegar, Victor Perez 6.50pm: Justin Suh, Tommy Fleetwood 7pm: Michael Block, Rory McIlroy 7.10pm: Justin Rose, Scottie Scheffler 7.20pm: Corey Conners, Bryson DeChambeau 7.30pm: Brooks Koepka, Viktor Hovland"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2023/may/21/jennifer-lawrence-brings-documentary-about-afghan-women-to-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T22:57:11Z","webTitle":"Jennifer Lawrence brings documentary about Afghan women to Cannes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/jennifer-lawrence-brings-documentary-about-afghan-women-to-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/21/jennifer-lawrence-brings-documentary-about-afghan-women-to-cannes","fields":{"headline":"Jennifer Lawrence brings documentary about Afghan women to Cannes","bodyText":"A documentary about the lives of three women living under the Taliban, co-produced by Jennifer Lawrence, has premiered at the Cannes film festival. Bread and Roses, shown at a special screening on Sunday, follows three Afghan women in the weeks after the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 after the withdrawal of US troops. The documentary was made by Excellent Cadaver, a production company set up by Lawrence and her producer friend Justine Ciarrocchi. “Jen’s first response was to find an Afghan film-maker and give them a platform,” Ciarrocchi told the Hollywood Reporter. Directed by Sahra Mani, whose 2018 documentary A Thousand Girls Like Me looked at a sexually abused woman’s quest for justice, the film aimed to show how the lives of women changed overnight under Taliban rule. “This film has a message from women in Afghanistan, a soft message: please be their voice who are voiceless under Taliban dictatorship,” said Mani at the premiere. She added: “Now that women can no longer leave the house without the veil, I thought we should tell their stories.” While the featured women did not know each other, they are all are from different groups who protested against the Taliban coup. In an interview on the Cannes website, Mani – now living in France – said filming the documentary was difficult and the safety of those involved was a top priority. “The way in which their lives have changed under the Taliban is an everyday reality for us,” she added. “It’s life under a dictatorship, a cruel reality we cannot ignore.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/21/brooks-koepka-becomes-first-liv-golfer-to-win-major-with-us-pga-triumph","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T22:55:00Z","webTitle":"Brooks Koepka becomes first LIV golfer to win major with US PGA triumph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/21/brooks-koepka-becomes-first-liv-golfer-to-win-major-with-us-pga-triumph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/21/brooks-koepka-becomes-first-liv-golfer-to-win-major-with-us-pga-triumph","fields":{"headline":"Brooks Koepka becomes first LIV golfer to win major with US PGA triumph","bodyText":"The cheers for Brooks Koepka’s US PGA Championship victory reverberated from Rochester to Riyadh. For the American, a fifth major title which places him alongside names such as Byron Nelson and Peter Thomson in golf’s pantheon of greats. He becomes only the 20th golfer in history to reach five. Arnold Palmer, who claimed seven, is within view. Koepka’s return from his darkest days, when it looked as if injury could curtail his career, is complete. He cut an uncharacteristically emotional figure on the final green, doubtless reflecting on his earlier physical distress. Koepka said: “This is probably the sweetest one of them all because of all the hard work that went into this one. This one is definitely special.” For LIV itself, there is validation that its much-maligned format does indeed have competitive merit. Perhaps Greg Norman can convince his Saudi Arabian paymasters that the LIV project is worthy of enhanced time and investment now that one of its players has seen off what is widely described as the strongest field in golf. Norman must be purring at Koepka’s success. Not so Jay Monahan and the PGA Tour; with Cameron Smith, the Open champion, now also a LIV golfer, the traditional ecosystem is minus two of four current major holders. Zach Johnson, the US Ryder Cup captain, surely cannot ignore this particular LIV rebel now or the conversation around him. Team Europe would have cause to fear Koepka in Rome in September. His 67 meant the margin of victory was two, at nine under par, from Viktor Hovland and Scottie Scheffler. The champion opened this tournament with a two-over-par 72. Koepka’s mission was to prevent Oak Hill from turning into Choke Hill. He must have felt extra pressure, given the final-round collapse which denied him a win at the Masters last month. He started like a man on a mission, with birdies on three of the first four holes to afford himself a three-shot lead over Hovland. When a procession looked likely, the golfing gods had other ideas. Koepka lost his ball from the tee at the sixth, triggering the first of two successive bogeys. Hovland pulled his playing partner level for a hole, the Norwegian also dropping a shot at the 7th. Birdies at the 10th and 12th for Koepka arrived either side of a pretty useful bogey at the short 11th. The Floridian’s tee shot had stuck in the face of a greenside bunker. By now, Scheffler had crept on to the scene with three birdies between the 10th and 14th. Koepka holed out impressively for par at the 13th to keep Hovland one adrift and Scheffler two back. Hovland converted for a birdie at the 14th to tie Koepka again, but only for a matter of seconds. Nine under played eight under, with Scheffler running out of holes when minus six after 15. Disaster was to strike for Hovland at the 16th. After finding a fairway bunker from the tee, the 25-year-old cracked his second shot straight into the face of the sand trap. Clearly rattled, Hovland was to tap in for a double bogey six. Koepka’s birdie three meant he led by four at 10 under; game over. Scheffler’s birdie at the last – his inward nine was of just 31 strokes – afforded him the runners-up spot alone until Hovland also closed out with a three. This felt a fair reflection of events given Hovland had traded blows with Koepka for so long. Kurt Kitayama, Bryson DeChambeau and Cam Davis shared fourth at three under. When Rory McIlroy hit his approach to within two feet of the cup at the first, hopes were raised that the Northern Irishman could make a charge towards the leaders. He had started the day five adrift of Koepka. Bogeys at the 2nd, 4th and 7th undid more fine work by McIlroy on the front nine. The playing of that half in level-par 35 was never likely to be enough. McIlroy picked up further shots at the 10th and 13th to edge inside the top five but had to settle for a share of seventh after a bogey on the 15th. He admitted thereafter that he had little expectation coming into the US PGA as he continues to battle technical flaws. He must change that scenario before next month’s US Open. While glory belonged to Koepka, the most endearing moment of day four was delivered by Michael Block. The club professional, who is ranked outside the top 3,000 golfers in the world, had defied all logic not only by making the cut but maintaining a place on the leaderboard. Block had McIlroy for Sunday company. Galleries exploded with delight at the par-three 15th as Block’s tee shot slammed straight into the hole. McIlroy was visibly delighted for his playing partner, whose disbelief was similarly plain. Block’s perfect seven iron, from 151 yards, will stay with anyone who witnessed it for ever. “It was an amazing golf shot,” said McIlroy. McIlroy and Block were again in warm embrace on the 72nd green. Block’s tie for 15th will earn him close to $300,000 and surely further opportunity in elite environments. Koepka’s LIV status is such that the $3.15m (£2.53m) cash prize for success at Oak Hill is basically irrelevant to him. Far more significant has proved to all doubters that he remains a true force."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/21/minneapolis-to-pay-700000-to-family-of-man-killed-by-police","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T21:56:37Z","webTitle":"Minneapolis to pay $700,000 to family of man killed by police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/21/minneapolis-to-pay-700000-to-family-of-man-killed-by-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/21/minneapolis-to-pay-700000-to-family-of-man-killed-by-police","fields":{"headline":"Minneapolis to pay $700,000 to family of man killed by police","bodyText":"The city of Minneapolis has agreed to a $700,000 settlement with family members who were locked inside two squad cars when police killed their father after officers refused their offers to try and help calm him down. A federal judge ruled that officers were justified in shooting 52-year-old Chiasher Vue after he pointed a rifle at them on 15 December 2019. The settlement will resolve a lawsuit his family filed arguing that police had illegally and unconstitutionally detained them that night. Chamee Vue and her brothers Hailee and Nou Vue tried to intervene but weren’t allowed out of the police cars. And after the shooting, they spent hours detained in interrogation rooms while police questioned them. “I couldn’t get out of the car, couldn’t give him reassurance that everything would be OK,” Chamee said. A language barrier contributed to the the killing because Chiasher Vue spoke little English and few officers there that night spoke Hmong. Hailee Vue said he wants the Hmong community to understand what happened to his family, and for their case to be instructive for future policing. “I just don’t want any other family to go through what the four of us went through,” he said. Since Chiasher Vue’s killing, Minneapolis police have changed department policy on handling witnesses to say they must be treated in a constitutional manner. A police spokesperson told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the policy change wasn’t related to this case, but the Vue siblings say they still take consolation in the change. The new policy makes it more clear that a person who has not been charged with a crime and isn’t being held on probable cause is free to leave at any time. Family members say Chiasher Vue was going through a mental health crisis and suffering with untreated depression on the night he was killed, just months before the 25 May 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set off worldwide protests. One of the officers charged with a role in Floyd’s killing was Hmong American. In Chiasher Vue’s case, a night of drinking and karaoke spiraled out of control when after a series of quarrels he fired several shots at a wall inside a house, and one of his sons called 911. An autopsy later determined that Chiasher Vue had a blood alcohol level of 0.20 at the time he was killed. “Look, my dad is mentally ill,” Nou Vue said to an unidentified officer, according to squad car footage. “Just let me and my little sister go talk to him. We can talk him out.” The officer replied: “You’re not getting out of the squad. Stop asking.” But after Vue came out of the house pointing a rifle, he and officers quickly exchanged gunfire. Investigators weren’t able to determine who fired first, but Vue was struck by 13 bullets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/21/fbi-investigation-border-patrol-shooting-death-arizona","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T21:39:41Z","webTitle":"FBI investigating shooting death of Native man by border patrol in Arizona ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/21/fbi-investigation-border-patrol-shooting-death-arizona","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/21/fbi-investigation-border-patrol-shooting-death-arizona","fields":{"headline":"FBI investigating shooting death of Native man by border patrol in Arizona ","bodyText":"The FBI and Tohono O’odham Nation police are investigating the fatal shooting of a tribal member by US border patrol agents in southern Arizona. Federal Customs and Border Protection officials said agents from the Ajo border patrol station “were involved” in a fatal shooting on the Tohono O’odham reservation near Ajo at about 10pm on Thursday. They haven’t released any additional information other than to say the encounter was under review by Customs and Border Protection’s office of professional responsibility, which investigates fatal shootings carried out by agents, among other cases. Tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr said in a statement on Sunday that the shooting occurred in the Meneger’s Dam community of the Tohono O’odham Nation and identified the victim. “Nation member Raymond Mattia lost his life in the incident,” Norris said. “Our hearts go out to his family and all those [affected] during this difficult time. “As the investigation proceeds, the Nation expects full consideration of all related facts of the incident and an appropriate and expeditious response from relevant public safety agencies. Because the investigation is ongoing, we will refrain from making further comment at this time.” Tucson TV station KVOA reported that Mattia had called the border patrol because there were multiple migrants who had trespassed into his yard, and he wanted assistance getting them off of his property. Meneger’s Dam is only a few miles from the US-Mexico border, where Covid-19 asylum limits known as Title 42 expired less than a week before the shooting. A rush to the border before Title 42 expired and new, arguably tougher immigration policies took effect brought extraordinary pressure on areas along boundaries separating the two counties. According to KVOA, Mattia’s family told them that he went outside when he saw the agents, and for an unknown reason they apparently shot him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/21/american-liv-players-should-not-miss-out-on-ryder-cup-says-mickelson","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T21:35:54Z","webTitle":"American LIV players should not miss out on Ryder Cup, insists Mickelson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/21/american-liv-players-should-not-miss-out-on-ryder-cup-says-mickelson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/21/american-liv-players-should-not-miss-out-on-ryder-cup-says-mickelson","fields":{"headline":"American LIV players should not miss out on Ryder Cup, insists Mickelson","bodyText":"Phil Mickelson has suggested it would be unfair for the likes of Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson to miss out on 2023 Ryder Cup participation because they are part of LIV Golf. The prominence of Koepka at the US PGA Championship has reignited debate over whether Zach Johnson, the US captain, should keep the door open for LIV rebels. Several American players are known to want Koepka and Dustin Johnson among their number for the September clash in Rome but lingering ill-feeling and court battles attached to the LIV breakaway make Zach Johnson’s position tricky. Mickelson has been front and centre of all things LIV from the outset. Mickelson, speaking after a closing round of 70 at Oak Hill, believes the US have to remain open-minded. “I don’t see the benefit of the Ryder Cup to change from what it historically has been,” said Mickelson. “Which is, the US versus Europe now. Originally it was versus Great Britain and Ireland. But I mean, I don’t see the benefit of changing that. I don’t see how it’s any of the concern of the PGA of America of what tour we play. But that’s just my opinion.” One certainty is that Mickelson, once a staple of the Ryder Cup setup, has waved goodbye to the event. He insisted it was “not his concern” whether Zach Johnson should be paying close attention to the LIV platform. “I’ve had a lot of great experiences in the Ryder Cup,” Mickelson added. “I’ve been part of, what, 13? I played in 12 and then I was vice-captain at Whistling Straits. I’ve had a lot of great opportunities, experiences, stories, memories. And I’ve had more than my share. So I’m fine with other people having those opportunities as well.” It is, however, clear Mickelson harbours a lingering grievance over the behaviour of golf’s traditional tours. The six-time major champion confirmed he met with the Department of Justice in recent weeks as part of the US government’s antitrust investigations into professional golf. Asked about LIV’s greatest achievement as it approaches its first anniversary of tournament play, the 52-year-old said: “It has provided 48 new professional golf opportunities at the highest pay which is incredible. And it is holding a lot of people accountable for some things that they’ve done. It’s appealing to a lot of the younger generation and getting a lot younger fans to come out. It is introducing a whole different vibe to the game of golf that I think is necessary.” Pressed on what he meant with the “accountable” reference, Mickelson said: “I don’t want to get into specific details. But I know a lot of stuff that that will come out later. I am appreciative that they’re being held accountable.” Similarly opaque was the following Mickelson statement: “I know some things that others don’t. So I just want to make sure everybody’s held accountable.” It is worth noting at this point that Mickelson earlier affirmed a group of LIV players would win a sporting arbitration case against the DP World Tour. They were duly defeated and comprehensively. Playing the smartest guy in the room is not always a successful tactic. Mickelson concedes that LIV’s footprint is currently far larger outside of the United States than within it. “Have a little bit more open mindedness? Maybe?” he said in response to how that could change in his home nation. “It’s my guess, but the people that come out and are part of the tournaments, seem to be really enjoying it. So look, it’s not going anywhere. It’s going to continue to accelerate and hopefully people continue to give it a try.” Zach Johnson plays the straightest of bats in respect of where or if LIV players fit into his Ryder Cup plan. He did admit decisions over captain’s picks – he has six of them – will not be solely his own. “Chemistry is important in any team,” he said. “I haven’t even began to discuss picks with anybody I trust, in my circle. I feel like it’s irrelevant to discuss right now. “I will say this, the guys on the PGA Tour who make that team have direct ownership of that team, collectively. For me to stand here and say I would be comfortable or uncomfortable with anything would be selfish on my part. It’s not my team. I have a leadership council and guys who will finish in the top six [automatic qualifying places] specifically. It’s their team.” Johnson believes it would be “irresponsible” for him to take in LIV tournaments as a spectator while he remains an active player on the PGA Tour. “It would be inappropriate for me to leave what I am trying to do as a competitor and as a leader,” he said. Here, Johnson matched Mickelson’s four round aggregate of 10 over par."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2023/may/21/labour-vows-to-reverse-rise-in-suicides-in-england-and-wales-within-five-years-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T21:30:37Z","webTitle":"Labour vows to reverse rise in suicides in England and Wales within five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/21/labour-vows-to-reverse-rise-in-suicides-in-england-and-wales-within-five-years-keir-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/21/labour-vows-to-reverse-rise-in-suicides-in-england-and-wales-within-five-years-keir-starmer","fields":{"headline":"Labour vows to reverse rise in suicides in England and Wales within five years","bodyText":"A Labour government would reverse the rise in the number of deaths from suicide as part of a health plan to replace pain and anxiety with a “hope of a renewed NHS”, Keir Starmer will pledge. In a speech on Monday, the Labour leader will say his plan for reforming the NHS will focus on the biggest causes of death in the UK including suicide. He will point to coroners’ statistics showing that deaths from suicides have been rising since 2008, and reached a record high last year in England and Wales. If the party takes power Labour will reverse this rise within five years, Starmer will say. A segment of his speech previewed by the party says: “Suicide is the biggest killer of young lives in this country. The biggest killer. That statistic should haunt us. And the rate is going up. Our mission must be and will be to get it down.” Labour has not provided details on how it proposes to meet this pledge other than an aspiration to shift from “sickness to prevention”. But setting out his vision for the future of the health service, Starmer will say it is based on “a mission that can lift the anxiety, the pain, the fear faced by millions of families across the country and replace it with hope of a renewed NHS”. Experts and campaigners gave the suicide pledge a cautious welcome, but urged any future Labour government to focus on tackling the wider societal causes of mental illness including poverty and inequality. Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “The focus on preventing mental illness is the right approach. Mental illness can in many cases be prevented with early intervention and by tackling root causes including inequality, racism and abuse. “A long-term whole of government plan to improve outcomes for people with mental illness is urgently needed. Adults with severe mental illness are almost five times more likely to die prematurely than the rest of the population with two out of three deaths from preventable illnesses.” Simon Blake, the chief executive of Mental Health First Aid England, said a determined focus on improving mental health and preventing suicide had “never been more important”. He said: “Reducing the unacceptably high numbers of people that die by suicide requires strong political will and a multifaceted approach which tackles the wider factors that influence mental health such as poverty, housing, discrimination including racism, education and employment.” Rishi Sunak is reportedly preparing to announce plans to allow patients to choose to receive treatment in private hospitals via the NHS app. The move is aimed at cutting the record 7.3 million-person waiting list, according to the Times. Starmer will also pledge to reduce deaths from heart disease and strokes by a quarter within 10 years. And he will say Labour will meet all cancer targets and reduce waiting lists. He will say: “The next Labour government will deliver an NHS that is there when you need it. No backsliding, no excuses. We will meet these standards again. We will get the NHS back on its feet.” Labour remains coy on how this will be financed. Asked on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether the party was looking to raise taxes, the shadow health minister, Liz Kendall, said: “No.” Pressed on the issue, she added: “Whilst extra investment is essential, what I would argue here is reform is absolutely part of it too.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

United looked poised to gift a fourth successive title to Chelsea by drawing against City until Lucia García’s injury-time strike. United need to win on Saturday at Liverpool but still require Chelsea to drop points at bottom club Reading. If Emma Hayes’s side draws and United win, it would be decided on goal difference. “We just need to win our game and score as many as we can, if we can, put Liverpool under pressure and do everything we can do,” Skinner said. “If it happens, it happens, it’s not in our control, so it would be wasted energy. If the miracle happens, I promise I will get a drink and we can have one together.” There was a record crowd at Leigh Sports Village for the Manchester derby, in which United confirmed at least second spot and a Champions League place. United took an early lead through Hayley Ladd but were pegged back by City in the second half, despite the sending off of Ellie Roebuck before the break but secured the points in injury-time in an entertaining spectacle. “Tonight was special,” Skinner said. “If we can keep giving the fans that and European nights, we will be a force in this game for many years to come. We’ve achieved something wonderful, but we are not stopping here and at the end of the season I will smile and we will have a celebration.” If Chelsea do secure top spot, it would be their fourth title in a row. Hayes said before United’s match: “If we win the title this will hands down be my favourite. It will feel that way.” Hayes required an emergency hysterectomy in October, missing a number of matches while she recovered. “Maybe that’s why it’s my favourite year,” she said. “My own personal health issues, that was friggin’ hard.

There was a message on the big screen a few minutes before the end, a reminder on the public address system that entering the playing surface was strictly illegal and would not be tolerated. There was a line of stewards and police officers poised like sprinters by the touchline, ready to secure the turf as soon as the game ended. And then the game ended and within seconds the grass was engulfed by stampeding boots and pounding steps and one little girl doing cartwheels, which to be fair was very cute. “PLEASE LEAVE THE PITCH,” the announcer pleaded again, as Manchester City’s players and staff dodged a swarm of flying bodies, some fully clothed and some not, each one bearing a smartphone with a little blinking red dot on the screen. They weren’t really celebrating, you see; they were simply taking what they thought was theirs. A few guys decided to carry out a strength test on the goalposts at the south end of the ground: a task probably best left until the summer and to trained maintenance personnel. Nothing against pitch invasions, personally speaking – as long as no harm is intended and no harm is done, then who cares? But there seemed to be a rich irony in the fact that the club that built an entire sporting dynasty on the right to do whatever it wanted had discovered a sudden taste for rules and order. Eventually the security staff restored a modicum of calm and the few remaining intruders could retreat to the stands, their content captured, their thirst for freedom slaked. So, after a fashion, the coronation could proceed: an event that ultimately proved not dissimilar to the actual coronation, another event dedicated to the glorification of state power and the flaunting of lavish wealth built on exploitation and plunder of the earth. They had clearly been planning this event at City for some time. The shirts had been freshly printed. The “Champions” banner was being unfurled across the frontage pretty much from the moment the final whistle went in Nottingham on Saturday evening. Even the players’ reaction to the moment of victory was captured not on jerky phone footage but by City’s in-house camera crew, ready to roll out across the club’s digital channels within minutes. Nothing here is left to chance. In many ways this is the founding ethos of Abu Dhabi’s little blue sock puppet: the ability to plot out not simply the next move but all the moves after that, a painstaking attention to detail, the blunt will and brazen assurance to remove not only the obstacles but the things that might one day be obstacles, maybe. Seven of the clubs in this season’s Premier League are yet even to win three games in a row. City have just won three titles in a row and the most remarkable thing is they barely seem bothered about it, as if this is simply natural, like water being water, like the car starting when you turn the key in the ignition. There was a game to play first, of course, which was fairly forgettable. Chelsea’s players had courteously formed a guard of honour beforehand: just the starting XI and substitutes, otherwise the pitch might not have been wide enough to fit them all. Lots of people seemed to be slipping over, although whether it was the pre-match watering or the tears of City’s haters, nobody could say for sure. There was even the heartwarming sight, around the half-hour, of Raheem Sterling running clean through on goal and missing a one-on-one chance in front of the City supporters. Who says this place has no sense of history? In the medium term Chelsea’s abundant wealth should make them one of the clubs best placed to challenge City’s dominance, just as soon as they can kick the habit of hiring Frank Lampard. As his team raised the pace in the second half, creating some decent openings, Chelsea’s interim manager waved and raved in his technical area, aware that a result at the home of the champions would be the sort of feather in his cap that could secure him the job on a permanent basis. Not this job, obviously. Maybe one of the England youth teams. Or something in Belgium. But ultimately Chelsea were the meat in the room here, and in many ways so was everybody else. Already you get the sense that City are floating away from their current time and place, a trend most evident in the frequent and not at all fatuous attempts to compare them with Manchester United’s 1999 treble winners or Bob Paisley’s Liverpool or Arsenal’s Invincibles or whatever. You see it, too, in Pep Guardiola’s increasing willingness to discuss his legacy, in City’s attempts to memorialise their triumphs almost in real time, the statues of David Silva and Vincent Kompany and Sergio Agüero. The present is already settled; now, it seems, City have set their sights on conquering the past and the future. And here, of course, the terrain gets trickier. There is a Premier League investigation to come: more arguments to win, more campaigns to plan. More challengers and more great teams will come along. Perhaps future generations will take a dimmer view of the wealth that helped City to success and the way it was sequestered. Nobody, not even autocratic rulers, get full control over their legacy. Some things, as ever, are best left to posterity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/21/johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-review-profoundly-depressing-television","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T21:00:36Z","webTitle":"Depp v Heard review – Amber and Johnny make for profoundly depressing television","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/21/johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-review-profoundly-depressing-television","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/21/johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-review-profoundly-depressing-television","fields":{"headline":"Depp v Heard review – Amber and Johnny make for profoundly depressing television","bodyText":"In 2019, Johnny Depp sued his ex-wife Amber Heard for defamation, after Heard wrote an article published in the Washington Post in which she referred to herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”. In 2020, the actor lost a separate libel case in the UK against the Sun, which had called him a “wife beater” in print. The US defamation hearing took place in 2022 in Virginia, and the jury ruled that Depp had been defamed by Heard. It also decided that in one matter, Depp had defamed Heard, but the verdict was widely viewed as a victory for Depp and a loss for his ex-wife. It was a sorry, gruesome spectacle that played out on social media, in no small part thanks to the decision of the judge to allow cameras in the courtroom. Channel 4’s documentary Depp v Heard is on hand to rehash it, remix it and serve it up again, under a thin veneer of commentary about how odd it was that a court case, which centred on whether domestic violence had taken place or not, proved to be catnip to a salivating audience. It is essentially a curated collage of courtroom footage, video and audio evidence, old press junket interviews with Depp and Heard, news reports and a torrent of YouTube and TikTok clips, alongside a running commentary from fans, amateur reporters, legal commentators and podcast hosts. Its selling point is that it sorts proceedings into chronological order and offers a timeline of the relationship. In court, Depp and Heard gave their testimonies two weeks apart. Here, a question is posed by one of their lawyers, and the response of each is played, as if to invite viewers to compare them, side by side. For those not in court, or those who did not watch the 200 hours or so of livestreamed footage, key aspects of the case would have appeared mostly in short clips and memes. Assembling it into some sort of order and giving it three hours’ worth of airtime is an attempt to be the adult in the room, trying to wrestle an uncontrolled and uncontrollable internet narrative into some sort of shape. Clearly, reducing legal arguments to the pithiest snippets and soundbites does not provide a complete or fair picture of the judicial process, nor of the lawsuit at the centre of this particular case. The question is whether Depp v Heard, the documentary, can do better than the many sources from which it pulls the bulk of its material. Channel 4 provided only the first two episodes for review; perhaps the third will offer more depth or analysis. So far, I have been unable to shake the sense that it tries to have its cake and eat it. It attempts to distance itself from the social media version of the hearing. There are moments highlighted that remain jaw-dropping to this day, such as the cosmetics brand getting involved (it denies “taking a formal stance”) with a TikTok video, as if the evidence being heard was mere marketing fodder. The idea that the jury was instructed not to read about or engage with the case outside the courtroom is also absurd, given the ubiquity of the reporting and the circus of commentary around it. There is no narrator tying it all together, only the clips and the testimonies, plus the news footage and the podcasters. This suggests a neutrality that the programme cannot deliver. It is only another way of repurposing the trial, in order to tell another version of the story. It pits Depp and Heard against each other in the court of public opinion again. By putting their testimonies side by side, surely it is asking viewers of this documentary to decide who it is that they believe. I found this to be profoundly depressing when the trial was taking place, and find it profoundly depressing now. Seeing people miming along to harrowing testimony on TikTok, whether you believe it or not, is bleak, and I was inclined to agree with the YouTuber here who calls it dystopian. I understand that the trial was a spectacle, and there was an enormous appetite for discussing and dissecting every single aspect of it. One TikToker called it “a PR campaign disguised as a defamation case”. If you were fascinated by proceedings, I am sure you will recognise plenty of what you saw in it, and perhaps you will learn something new from its collection of voices. But the idea that a case like this is normal and acceptable as entertainment fodder was bleak then, and remains bleak today. Depp v Heard tries to distance itself from the machine, occasionally hinting that there is something wrong, but in the end, it becomes only another cog, whirring away. Depp v Heard is on Channel 4."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/morning-mail-supermarkets-profiteering-claim-jobs-growth-welcomed-the-battle-for-bakhmut","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T21:00:31Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Supermarkets profiteering claim, jobs growth welcomed, the battle for Bakhmut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/morning-mail-supermarkets-profiteering-claim-jobs-growth-welcomed-the-battle-for-bakhmut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/morning-mail-supermarkets-profiteering-claim-jobs-growth-welcomed-the-battle-for-bakhmut","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: Supermarkets profiteering claim, jobs growth welcomed, the battle for Bakhmut","bodyText":"Good morning.

Hari Budha Magar, who lives in Canterbury, Kent, reached the summit of the world’s tallest mountain at 3pm on Friday, having started the climb on 17 April – exactly 13 years since he lost his legs after an IED explosion. While waiting 18 days at the Everest base camp for the weather to clear, the veteran and his crew faced freezing conditions and saw two dead bodies being dragged down. Speaking to the PA news agency from the Mount Everest base camp, he said: “All of my jackets were completely freezing. It was all frozen. Even our warm water, we put hot water in the Thermos, and that was also frozen and we were not able to drink.” He continued: “When I came down we ran out of oxygen. The guys came up with oxygen … I was bumping down on my bum and we had 30, 40 minutes of oxygen, and we still had about two, three hours to get down.” However, the poor weather meant his sunglasses and oxygen mask were frozen over and he was only able to spend a few minutes at the top of the mountain. Throughout the challenge, he was supported by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Krish Thapa, also a former Gurkha and SAS mountain troop leader. Budha Magar became the first double above-the-knee amputee to summit the world’s tallest mountain. Budha Magar said he felt his life was “completely finished” when he lost his lower legs in Afghanistan, battling alcoholism and depression. “I grew up in Nepal, up to age of 19, and I saw how the disabled people were treated in those remote villages,” he said. “Many people still think that disability is a sin of previous life and you are the burden of the earth. I believed this myself because that is what I saw. That is how I grew up.” He continued: “It was a pretty hard time and at one point I was just drinking too much, to just control my pain and emotions and all the things, and I tried to kill myself a couple of times.” He added that he first thought about climbing Everest when he was walking to school barefoot and planned to do so in 2018. However, double amputees and blind people were banned in an attempt to reduce the number of climbers dying on the peak. The veteran helped campaign to have the ban removed so he could attempt to summit the peak. Budha Magar left Nepal to serve as a corporal with the Ghurka regiment in the British army before his injury. Once he is down from the mountain, he says he is looking forward to spending time with his family and wants to return to Afghanistan to the site when he lost his legs so he can say “thank you”. He said: “Without [losing my legs], I wouldn’t be climbing Everest, so and it wouldn’t even count much. Whatever happens, it happens for good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/21/chelsea-on-verge-of-retaining-wsl-title-after-sinking-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T20:25:44Z","webTitle":"Chelsea on verge of retaining WSL title after Eriksson caps win over Arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/chelsea-on-verge-of-retaining-wsl-title-after-sinking-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/21/chelsea-on-verge-of-retaining-wsl-title-after-sinking-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea on verge of retaining WSL title after Eriksson caps win over Arsenal","bodyText":"It has taken Emma Hayes four games to get the better of Jonas Eidevall in the league since he joined Arsenal from Rosengård in 2021 – more than any other manager she has faced. But there was no more significant time to end that run, and no more significant a scorer of Chelsea’s second goal in this 2-0 victory. Chelsea needed a win to briefly extend their lead against Manchester United to five points and render United’s late victory in the Manchester derby somewhat irrelevant. Three points against Reading on Saturday will secure Chelsea the title. Arsenal were left ruing Katie McCabe’s missed second-half penalty, but had their Champions League place all but confirmed by City’s evening defeat. Kingsmeadow fizzed with anticipation hours before kick-off, the away section full and vocal as the players warmed up. But the sold-out home crowd would dampen the sound of the travelling posse when Guro Reiten scored her eighth Women’s Super League goal of the season to give Chelsea the lead before the departing captain, Magda Eriksson, added an emotional second in her final game at Kingsmeadow. “This is so fitting, of course she’s scored today,” Hayes said. “Everybody wanted that fairytale for her. She has been our captain and leader. I know the work that has gone on behind the scenes to get the team to where it is. I just looked on to the pitch and all I see is the years of work in the background. The meetings, the analysis, the disagreements, the good times and the moments you’re sick of looking at each other. “It’s all of those things and when they come off this team has a habit of peaking when it matters. There’s three senior leaders in our team and I think it’s important that the baton is passed on through them.” Hayes made six changes to the starting XI that beat West Ham on Wednesday night, with Erin Cuthbert, Lauren James, Reiten, Maren Mjelde, Ève Périsset and Ann-Katrin Berger all having been rested following the FA Cup final victory against United last weekend. For Eidevall, there were fewer options to rotate between given Arsenal’s lengthy injury list. So there was just one change, an enforced one, with Kathrine Kühl replacing Lia Wälti who was injured in the 4-1 defeat of Everton on Wednesday. This has been a difficult season for Eidevall’s side. They have lost Vivianne Miedema, Beth Mead, Leah Williamson and Laura Wienroither to anterior cruciate ligament injuries; Kim Little and Wälti to injury for the close of the campaign; and have been without Caitlin Foord and Steph Catley for long stretches. Arsenal have remained competitive despite players dropping out, but Wälti’s injury was one too many, making them that bit too light in midfield. “It is one factor,” said Eidevall on whether the injuries had made it too hard to compete for the title. “When we are building for next season we know player availability is an important KPI [key performance indicator] if you’re going to be successful. We know the number of games is not going to be less, the competitiveness is not going to be less, so we need a deeper squad in order to deal with those situations. You see that with Chelsea here, they have been able to use their squad in a very good way. That is something we need to improve next season.” It was end to end at Kingsmeadow, but the home team had the edge and had the ball in the back of the net in the 10th minute. However the flag was raised, with Sam Kerr offside when Reiten played the ball through the legs of Lotte Wubben-Moy. Arsenal forced a fine save from Berger moments later. Foord won the ball from Périsset in the middle, that set Stina Blackstenius free on the left but Berger read the move well and came out to block the shot. A goal was inevitable and, while Arsenal had threatened, Chelsea looked in control and keen to make amends for a disappointing performance in their 3-1 Continental Cup final defeat by this team. There was some fortune in the goal that put the home side ahead, with Périsset slipping as she played a perfect long ball to Reiten and the Norwegian sliding on to one knee while steering the ball goalward on the half volley. Chelsea extended their lead shortly before the break, Arsenal undone by a set piece as they have been too often this season. Reiten’s free-kick from the right swung towards Kerr who headed it down for Eriksson to poke the ball beyond Manuela Zinsberger having escaped her marker. Arsenal came out fired up in the second half. Foord smacked an effort off the bar then they had a penalty as a result of a Sophie Ingle handball, but McCabe, the captain, pulled her penalty wide and too much damage had been done before the break. Only the most catastrophic of collapses against Reading on Saturday will deny them a fourth consecutive title and a third back-to-back league and FA Cup double, in a season where they have had to tough it out like never before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/21/jeffrey-epstein-extort-bill-gates-extramarital-affair","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T20:08:40Z","webTitle":"Jeffrey Epstein allegedly tried to extort Bill Gates over extramarital affair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/21/jeffrey-epstein-extort-bill-gates-extramarital-affair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/21/jeffrey-epstein-extort-bill-gates-extramarital-affair","fields":{"headline":"Jeffrey Epstein allegedly tried to extort Bill Gates over extramarital affair","bodyText":"The convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein appeared to threaten Bill Gates and tried to blackmail the multi-billionaire over his extramarital affair with a Russian bridge player, according to a new report published by the Wall Street Journal. Speaking to the Journal, sources familiar with the matter said that after Epstein found out about the Microsoft co-founder’s affair with Russian bridge player Mila Antonova, he threatened Gates into reimbursing him for tuition costs that Epstein had initially covered for Antonova to attend software coding school. Epstein’s threat to Gates came in the form of an email he sent in 2017 after he failed to convince Gates to join a multibillion-dollar charity fund he attempted to set up, according to the sources. Gates met Antonova in about 2010, when she was in her 20s, and went on to play bridge with her. In a 2010 YouTube video, Antonova recounted a tournament that she played with Gates, saying: “I didn’t beat him but I tried to kick him with my leg.” According to documents reviewed by the Journal, Antonova wanted to establish an online bridge tutorial business and was attempting to secure funds. Through Boris Nikolic, a close Gates adviser, Antonova was introduced to Epstein to help her raise funds for her initiative, which sought to “promote bridge by creating quality tutorials for beginners and advanced players”, the Journal reported. Antonova and Nikolic met Epstein at his townhouse in November 2013 in New York City, where she presented her fundraising proposals to him and sought half a million dollars, according to the Journal. Antonova told the outlet that Epstein ultimately did not invest in the initiative. Nevertheless, Antonova went on to stay at an apartment in New York a year later that Epstein provided her. “I didn’t interact with him or with anyone else while there,” she said. Epstein at one point paid for Antonova to attend software coding school, the Journal reported. “Epstein agreed to pay, and he paid directly to the school,” she told the outlet. “Nothing was exchanged. I don’t know why he did that. “When I asked, he said something like he was wealthy and wanted to help people when he could.” During the time Antonova was looking to set up her initiative, Epstein was also trying to set up his own fund. According to documents reviewed by the Journal, Epstein was attempting to establish his charitable fund with JP Morgan, which would require ultra-wealthy individuals to make a minimum $100m contribution and pay him millions of dollars in fees. The fund was supposed to be a way for Epstein to rebuild his reputation after he was forced to register as a sex offender and had pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution, according to sources that spoke to the Journal. Documents reviewed by the outlet showed that Epstein’s fund was contingent upon obtaining support from Gates. In emails sent to JP Morgan executives, Epstein tried to come off as a close adviser to Gates, despite not including the Microsoft co-founder in the emails, which the Journal reviewed. “In essence, this [fund] will allow Bill to have access to higher quality people, investment, allocation, governance without upsetting either his marriage or the sensitvities [sic] of the current foundation employees,” Epstein wrote in an email in August 2011. He followed up the next day, writing: “Bill is terribly frustrated. He [would] like to boost some of the things that are working without taking away from thoses [sic] that are not.” Two months later, Epstein sent another email to JP Morgan executives after the company prepared a presentation on the project, writing, “the presentation, is not tailored to [Bill]. He is the only person, the only one, that counts.” Speaking to the Journal, a JP Morgan spokesperson said: “The firm didn’t need him for introductions. Knowing what we know today, we wish we had never done business with him.” Similarly, the Journal reported that a Gates spokesperson “has said Epstein never worked for Gates and misrepresented their ties in communications with JP Morgan and others”. In 2017, Epstein emailed Gates about Antonova after Gates’s extramarital affair ended, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. In the email, Epstein asked Gates to reimburse him for Antonova’s coding school costs. “The tone of the message was that Epstein knew about the affair and could expose it, the people said,” the Journal reported, adding that a Gates spokesperson said that the Microsoft founder “had no financial dealings with Epstein”. Two years later, in 2019, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking a minor and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. Epstein denied the charges and was refused bail. He died months later in custody in an apparent suicide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/21/kyle-walker-says-manchester-city-must-win-treble-to-become-all-time-greats","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T20:07:34Z","webTitle":"Kyle Walker says Manchester City must win treble to become all-time greats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/kyle-walker-says-manchester-city-must-win-treble-to-become-all-time-greats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/21/kyle-walker-says-manchester-city-must-win-treble-to-become-all-time-greats","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Walker says Manchester City must win treble to become all-time greats","bodyText":"Kyle Walker has said Manchester City have to claim the treble to join the list of all-time great sides after they lifted the Premier League trophy for a third successive year.

We’ve been called the fourmidables [four domestic trophies in a season, including the Community Shield] and the centurions [getting 100 points in the league] but to go and get this we can really stamp our mark on being one of the greatest teams of all time in the Premier League.” The City manager, Pep Guardiola, said he is content if his players are now thinking of the treble. “They know it,” he said. “The feeling I have is that if [even] we win five Premier Leagues under me we still have the Champions League to win. But we have had fun in all that period here still – we cannot deny it. There is a part that sometimes can be unfair for the fact you have to win the Champions League to give credit or value to what you have done but you have to accept it and I think it’s good. “I know it [my era] will not be complete if we don’t win the Champions League – sometimes, playing with this pressure is so nice and necessary. We tell each other a lot that we have to do it. But if we are not able to do it and the club continues in this way sooner or later we will do it. We have to try.” No English team have claimed four consecutive league titles but Guardiola is already targeting such an achievement. “So next season all the teams want to beat us, it’s normal. We will defend our crown and mentally we have to be prepared: let’s go for the fourth and try to do it again because I’m pretty sure the way we’re going, to play with the clarity we have and the human quality all the players and staff have and may be new players: the quality will be there. The difference will still be to go to Crystal Palace and all the other tough games like we have done these years.” The victory against Chelsea was their 12th in row in the league and came in a party atmosphere that had been prevalent all day after the Arsenal result the previous day. Guardiola was the first person to receive his winner’s medal, given to him by Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, which in February brought more than 100 charges against City for financial wrongdoing – all denied by the club. Asked if the triumph was sweeter because of the allegations and Arsenal’s challenge, Guardiola said: “I would say no. I don’t remember perfectly but we won a lot of games in a row to beat Liverpool in the past. The first leg [of the season] from Arsenal – they did 50 points. I had the feeling that it would take something special because it would be so difficult, they played exceptional football all season.” The captain, Ilkay Gündogan, lifted the trophy and Erling Haaland, who has scored 36 league goals, was sprayed with champagne. “I feel unreal, I don’t know what to say, it’s just unreal, I’m so happy,” the Norwegian said. “These are memories I will remember for the rest of my life, we have been fighting so hard. It’s special, I’m just going to enjoy this day, it’s a special moment with this trophy with these fans and the whole club.” Haaland said he can improve. “Of course, but my debut season, 36 goals so far, a Premier League trophy and two finals left, not a bad start,” he said. This was Guardiola’s 11th championship in 14 seasons as a coach. City’s win against Chelsea was a 28th of the campaign which takes them to 88 points, seven clear of Arsenal with two games left, having been 11 behind Mikel Arteta’s side at one stage. Walker pinpointed the moment when he believed Arsenal could be overhauled. “I thought after coming back from the World Cup and we beat Liverpool here [3-2 in the League Cup], I thought that was a marker, we had a lot of the players missing and the manager had been working hard with the players that were here. From then on we always believed we could do it, we then went to Leeds and won there. This group of lads are second to none, they’re winners and that’s how we get across the line more times than not. “But we’re not finished, we’ve got the FA Cup against our bitter rivals and the Champions League final on 10 June. We will enjoy it today, we will have a few glasses of champagne but then we move on to June.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2023/may/21/manchester-united-v-manchester-city-womens-super-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T20:05:12Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City: Women’s Super League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/may/21/manchester-united-v-manchester-city-womens-super-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2023/may/21/manchester-united-v-manchester-city-womens-super-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City: Women’s Super League – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you so much for joining me for this decisive match in the WSL. Chelsea thought they would be celebrating the title win after Angeldahl equalised but United love a late goal and Garcia has sent the title race to the final day! We will have all the updates next weekend so make sure you don’t miss a thing. For now have a read of tonight’s action: Credit has to go to Man City who went down to 10 just before half-time. To only concede in injury time is impressive. It will be interesting to see the direction of City over the summer – manager Taylor is out of contract. Will he keep his job? If they don’t qualify for the Champions League it will be the first time they don’t in eight season. Player of the Match Ona Batlle told Sky: “It’s a massive win for us which shows our focus. We are going to go to Liverpool to win. I think we have had this winning feeling often so we are getting used to it! It is an incredible feeling. 100% I am proud of the club, the girls, the staff. We have been good but we still have one more game to go. The fans are our support, at home we feel them and we keep fighting for them.” So what do Manchester United and Chelsea need to do to win the title? Chelsea just need to win their game against Reading and it is theirs. If United win they need Chelsea to lose or draw. If Chelsea do draw, United will have to win by 6 goals to take the title on goal difference. Fair to say United are happy about that top three spot! Manchester United have now cemented Champions League football for the first time! They will be playing European football next season. Man City will have to have a huge win next weekend and for Arsenal to lose to get a top three spot. Here are the second half goals: I think what is clear is that Manchester United have one thing in their mind, the WSL title. Celebrations after that win aren’t crazy, they aren’t just taking this as a win. It’s the trophy or nothing – as it should be. United are one of the biggest clubs in the WSL now, this season has cemented them as a top four side. Their first win over Arsenal and City so far. Wow, what a Manchester derby! Garcia will get the plaudits for the winning goal but a shout out has to go to Le Tissier whose expert block stopped Shaw finding the winner first. A first win over Manchester City. A lifeline for the title race. To the final day of the season we go! 90 + 6 min: Boe Risa gives away a free kick and gets a yellow card for a shirt pull, the set piece is deep in the half though. Keating sends it deep but United clear it. 90 + 5 min: And so as things stand the title race will go into the final day! Chelsea may have thought the title would be theirs but United come good again. United are looking for another here, that would put this to bed. 90 + 3 min: Skinner really is so calm there, a goal that has potentially kept them in the WSL title race and he has remained on his seat. Galton has been replaced by Thomas. Cool as you like, the sub has United ahead. Blundell whallops it into the box, Boe Risa crosses it and Garcia has it in the back of the net. Marc Skinner calmly claps in his seat. 90 min: City have a long range free kick after a Zelem challenge, the United captain gets a yellow card. It is whipped in but United stall the threat. There will be six minutes added. 89: Oh my Le Tissier! What a block. The best I’ve seen in a while! Phenomenal play. Shaw looks sure to score but Le Tissier ensure she doesn’t. She has to be on the flight to Australia this summer. 89 min: Kelly crosses it in from the corner, the ball pinballs around and United can’t clear it initially. They eventually get it away. 88 min: The crowd comes to life as Galton has a chance but the defence does really well to clear it. Then Le Tissier expertly closes down Shaw, she wins a corner though. 7, 864 people at Leigh Sports Village. 87 min: If you can’t tell I am on the edge of my seat watching every ball go in! I’m a neutral in this and I’m still so nervous, how are United and City fans feeling? City are now with the ball and trying to create something magic with Angeldahl rocketing a long range shot but Earps collects. 86 min: United’s attack is a little stalled but they still have it, the fans in the stadium not as encouraging as they once were. City’s defence are doing really well here but they have conceded a corner. It comes in and it’s scrambled around the box. It comes to Williams, Batlle whips it but it’s blocked! It comes back in and Turner gets a head to it, Keating catches. 84 min: Williams gives away a free kick on halfway, Houghton will belt this upfield. Jelly collects it and Hasegawa whips it in. Nothing comes of it and possession exchanges hands. Keating clears poorly and United are on the charge. 82 min: Oh my word, Raso was a whisker away from finding a City winner! Kelly whips it in and Raso’s shot is wide. Wow, this game! End-to-end. City have replaced Coombs with Castellanos. 81 min: Kelly does well to steal it away from United in City’s half. But the hosts win it back and Ladd has a shot but it is wide. They need to do something soon if they are to rescue their title hopes. Two saves from Keating as Boe Risa and Garcia have whacks at goal! 79 min: Galton looks in a lot of pain here from that challenge, she is wincing as the doctors treat her. She looks like she is okay to continue, a great sign for United. 78 min: United are on the edge of the box again but Garcia is guided out. City make a change now as Raso comes on for Hemp. Taylor will be really happy with this performance, while a win is what he’d want to come back from a first half red card to equalise is hugely impressive. Galton is down injured after a challenge and Angeldahl has a yellow. 76 min: Galton makes an impressive run and manages to cross it in but no United player is there to pounce. United are throwing everything at this right now, their title hopes are hanging in the balance. The hosts make more changes as Garcia and Boe Risa are on for Toone and Parris. Parris had a phenomenal game. 74 min: Kelly does well to win it in the midfield as City start to take control of this. Possession exchanges hands and it ends with United on the hunt for a winner. 72 min: The ball is whipped in but Keating confidently collects, while the replacement keeper hasn’t had much to do it is still a strong and confident performance so far. The 18-year-old was called into action after roebuck was red carded. Kelly whips it in and Earps saved it! Wow, that was almost in the back of the net. 71 min: United have come to life from the equaliser! Zelem whips it in and Galton has a touch and it’s deflected out! Zelem takes it but it is headed away. 70 min: It won’t only be Manchester City fans who liked that, the Chelsea fans will also be celebrating as if the score stays like this they have won the title! City have a corner and it is belted in bit it’s repelled. Angeldahl crosses it but it goes all the way in! 68 min: Zelem gives away a free kick but before City take it Russo has been taken off in place of Williams. Greenwood takes it and Shaw almost pounces, she heads it and Earps saves! So close to an equaliser there, wow. 66 min: Hasegawa loses the ball in the midfield and Zelem and Toone create a chance in the box but it has too much on it for Galton to have a shot. 65 min: Russo makes a good run again and she passes to Toone, the England international loses out though with City’s defence quelling the threat. Toone then gives away possession close to City’s box. 63 min: Shaw receiving boos every time she on the ball here, I don’t know why she went down with a good reason! A scrappy game now as possession exchanges hands across the pitch, United eventually come away with it. Blundell pings it in the box but Keating collects. 61 min: Oh my word how has Galton not scored? Russo makes a great run down the right and squares it to Galton but her shot is wide. That should have been in the back of the net. 59 min: Bronze is with Wiegman in the stands here, she is recovering from a knee injury. Shaw is back to her feet, I believe she is okay to continue. If VAR was in operation would that have been a penalty? It think the referee would have had another look for sure. 57 min: Russo is on the charge here but her pass, wanting to find Galton, ends up on Houghton’s boots. City counter, Kelly crosses in and Hemp heads it. Shaw ends up on the floor and they call for a penalty but it isn’t given. She is still on the floor here, she is kicked from Ladd. 56 min: Galton wants a penalty as Parris turns well and lays it off well. Galton gets in the area and Hemp tackles her, they both go down and the referee goes in City’s favour. The visitors are definitely still in this, more than you would expect being a player down. 54 min: It comes in but City deal with it well. This second half has been good from City but they have nothing to show for it so far, United seem to have taken a step back. 52 min: Blundell whips it in but Greenwood heads away, Parris has a shot and Greenwood hits it behind for a corner. 51 min: It’s Greenwood who actually takes it! It’s a great delivery and Kelly gets a head to it and it hits the crossbar! Wow, so close to an equaliser. It comes out for Morgan but she skies it. 50 min: Houghton lofts the ball upfield and Shaw gets a boot to it but Le Tissier clears. Shaw does her best theatrical fall from a Zelem foul and she wins a free kick. Kelly is going to take it. 49 min: City do get it to the box but Turner does well to clear the ball. Galton works the ball well but then she fouls Morgan who wins it back. 47 min: Batlle does well to hit the ball over the head of Shaw but her resulting pass isn’t great and City are back with it. City win a free kick and Greenwood takes it in her own half to a raft of boos from United fans. They take it short and have a lot of work to do to get a goal. Well can United stay on top and make the most of being a player up? Or will City pull of a famous comeback? The next 45 will determine it. Remember City could still get something here, Georgia Stanway got a red in the derby last year but they got a draw.

United will have to beat Liverpool to be in a shout. If Chelsea beat Reading the title is theirs, if they draw and United win it will come down to goal difference, which Chelsea currently lead by five. Here is the red card by Roebuck, for me Parris is onside. Regardless of if she is or isn’t though Roebuck should not be making a challenge like that. Well it has been an eventful first half! United started electrically, Ladd with a screamer of a goal! City started to build into it and then Roebuck was red carded for a silly challenge on Parris. All to play for. 45 + 2 min: interesting point made on social media, they are questioning whether Parris would have been offside anyway. If she was the challenge from Roebuck was even more of a crazy decision. 45 + 1 min: There will be two minutes added here. 45 min: United have a free kick from that Roebuck challenge, Russo over this one. It’s a wasted chance as the set piece goes well wide. 44 min: Keating is coming on, the 18-year-old keeper called upon here. Ouahabi is off – frustrating for a player who did nothing wrong. 44 min: I’m just wondering who will now come off as City will bring on their reserve keeper. Nothing confirmed yet. Russo finds a peach of a pass to Parris and Roebuck completely wipes her out! What a ridiculous decision from Roebuck! She is off. 42 min: Zelem gives away with ball and Hemp gets it into the box but Shaw can’t quite get to it. Coombs leaves it as she thinks it is going to another City player but Untied pick it up! 41 min: Kelly takes the corner but it is over Houghton. City still have it but they run it back to halfway. 40 min: Kelly pops it into the box and she wins a corner. 39 min: Hasegawa makes a good run to find Hemp who crosses in with a one touch pass. It finds Shaw but she is crowded out in the box. Hemp does well again, this time finding Coombs. It is patient play from City, can they find an equaliser here? 37 min: Hemp loses out to Batlle, the United star one of the brightest on the pitch right now. City do win it back but the United press means they are with Roebuck. Houghton’s pass is given away with United and Parris is through! But her shot is straight at Roebuck. City need to be smarter, sloppy passes are letting them down. 35 min: Shaw gets a foul this time and City can form an attack. It falters all the way back to Roebuck, the pass to her almost intercepted by Russo! That was almost a second for United there, my heart jumped into my mouth! 34 min: Blundell finds Russo on the edge of the box but City crowd her out. The sky blues win it back but United are so clinical in their press they quickly have it back. Possession keeps exchanging hands, the game getting slightly scrappy here – Batlle takes a long range shot but Roebuck easily collects. 32 min: Turner spots Parris in a good position but she can’t remain onside as the pass comes in. Houghton’s clearance kick is straight out and United are on the front foot once again. 30 min: Shaw wanted a foul in the midfield but it isn’t given. A long range pass comes in for Batlle but it has too much on it. Both sides have settled in this now, the earlier franticly positive United start has died down. 28 min: Galton works it into the box and Roebuck should have caught that but Batlle instead wins a corner. Zelem takes the set piece but Greenwood heads away, it comes to Le Tissier who heads it but Roebuck collects. 27 min: City come again looking for that equaliser, United’s early dominance has really worn off. Hemp is brought down by Parris and they have a free kick in a good position. Greenwood takes it short and they run it back to Roebuck. They eventually work it upfield but United do well to win it back. 25 min: City are playing a bit of possession-based football now as they run the ball back to Roebuck. They work it well into the box but Batlle plays it away from Coombs. 23 min: Hemp belts it in but it is blocked, Batlle sees it out for a corner. Greenwood takes this one and she foes short to Coombs but her shot it blocked. It seemed City rushed that set piece a bit. 22 min: Kelly takes the corner kick but Blundell makes a great block, without her I think City score there! The visitors are growing here. 21 min: That is a poor pass from Greenwood, she is being pressed but her clearance kick is straight out of play. City have worked the ball up the well into the box, Shaw’s shot is blocked and then Kelly has a punt that rattles the wood work. Wow! City win a corner. 19 min: Toone wins a corner as United look to pounce on their momentum. Zelem takes it short to Parris, who lays it back to her captain. She belts it in but Galton’s header is wide. 18 min: Parris does really well in a midfield battle to win a free kick, Zelem takes it but Coombs heads away. It comes back to Russo who crosses it back in, Parris keeps it alive but Greenwood does well to quell the threat. 16 min: De Gea watches on in the stands as United continue to perform well in this one. The hosts create another attacking opportunity but Galton is ruled offside. Here is a look at the opening goal: 14 min: Greenwood, the former United player, is being booed every time she is on the ball. Shaw makes a good run and wins a corner. Greenwood takes but Earps confidently comes out and catches. 13 min: The attack ends in a City throw and they can relieve some pressure. City have had a sustained period of possession here, they are yet to build it into a solid chance yet. 11 min: Batlle makes a great run to set up another attack and Parris does well again to turn to keep it in field. Zelem is urged to shoot from far out but United opt for a patient build-up. 10 min: Parris doing well to close down Hasegawa, she is everywhere for United right now! A great stat provided by Sky, when United score first this season they have only not won once – the reverse fixture of this derby which was a draw. Hemp draws a foul and City have a free kick miles away from goal. Greenwood takes it but it can’t find Shaw and Earps collects. 8 min: United have the first corner of the match as City look scrambled! Zelem will take it and it’s over the bar. I’m still reeling from the screamer goal! 6 min: What a performance Parris is having in front of Wiegman, backing up her great effort in the FA Cup final last weekend. Batlle finds Parris on the edge of the box, she fires the ball in and it goes just ahead of Galton. 4 min: Jeez, Roebuck is forced into a save as Parris almost doubles their lead in as many minutes! Wow United are up for this! 4 min: I am honestly stunned, that is one of the best goals I’ve seen in a long time. The build-up, the great Parris play, the fast passes to Ladd who whips it. And here they come again. I’m stunner, a screamer!! Parris has done expertly well to steal the ball there, wow! She makes a storming run to the edge of the box. It eventually comes to Ladd who slams it home. WOW! 2 min: Man City try and set up an early attack but Kelly is ruled offside. City have had the lionshare of possession so far. Here we go! The derby is underway, a potential decider of this WSL season. Can United beat City for the first time ever to make sure they keep themselves in the title race? Or will City boost their Champions League hopes? Leigh Sports Village is thought to have sold-out for this Manchester derby! United will have them on their side and the roar is loud as they walk out onto the pitch. Manchester City manager Gareth Taylor is also fully focused on getting the most out of the derby: “We want to be in the Champions League. I am here to deliver the best,” the boss said. “We know we need the three points and that’s what we’ll do. It’s about using what the game brings. There’s no need to instigate fire in their bellies in this one. That comes naturally.” Marc Skinner is having a nice chat with Sarina Wiegman ahead of kick-off! Manchester United boss Marc Skinner is backing his side to get the full three points: “I feel that Manchester City, look, they’re tough. Anyone in that bracket can hurt any team within that top part of the table. So I feel that we’ve got to be at our very best. But we believe in ourselves. We believe that we can beat Manchester City. But I’ll be very clear, we have no right to do that.” A fun fact for you before we dive into what the managers have said ahead of the Manchester derby. Chelsea set a new record for the most consecutive home wins in WSL history today with the victory over Arsenal being their 15th. They are also the only team to ever win all their home matches in a season and have done so for a second time, also achieving the feat last campaign. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes believes the WSL race will come down to the wire. She said after the Arsenal match: “What you start thinking about is ‘it’s not far until the end’. There was no thought in my mind other than ‘another one to go’. Things might change depending on what happens later [if United fail to beat City] but I expect it to go to the last day.” Will Unwin is at the stadium for us this evening and has sent over a taster of what it is like to be at Leigh Sports Village: “It is a beautiful day in Leigh for a sold-out Manchester derby. The pub on the corner of the ground is packed with drinkers in red or blue. There is the faintest of hope that United can still win the derby, something City will be desperate to end and bolster their own Champions League ambitions the process.” He has also raised a good point, City have only named five substitutes on their matchday line-up but I cannot see an explanation as to why anywhere. If anyone has the answer email me or tweet! Catch up with all the action from Chelsea’s win, including a missed Arsenal penalty, here: Here’s what the WSL table looks like ahead of this clash: I went for a walk on my break just now on this sunny Sunday and thought I’d pop in a shop for some ice cream for this match. I went to get some Ben and Jerry’s cookie dough but it was £6.70! I put it firmly back in the freezer and continued my walk. Crazy price! Let me know what you are up to or your score prediction for this one via Twitter or email. The relegation battle will come down to the final day as Leicester City failed to wrap up their survival. A win over West Ham would have sealed their top flight spot but they suffered a 2-1 defeat. They will now have to hope they beat Brighton and Reading lose to Chelsea next weekend. Elsewhere in the WSL, Liverpool and Aston Villa drew 3-3 earlier today and Rachel Daly scored once again for her club. That puts her three goals clear in the Golden Boot race with Man City’s Bunny Shaw hot on her tail. The team news is here! Manchester United have named an unchanged starting line-up from their Women’s FA Cup loss to Chelsea last weekend. United: Earps, Batlle, Blundell, Toone, Zelem, Galton, Ladd, Le Tissier, Turner, Parris, Russo Manchester City, meanwhile, have made one change from their starting line-up who lost to Liverpool last time out. Ouahabi comes in for Casparji. City: Roebuck, Morgan, Houghton (C), Greenwood, Ouahabi, Hasegawa, Angeldahl, Coombs, Kelly, Hemp, Shaw Hello and welcome to one of the biggest Women’s Super League matches this season. Manchester United host Manchester City in the must-win game for Marc Skinner’s side if they want to remain in the title race. Anything but a win would hand the trophy to Chelsea after Emma Hayes’ side beat Arsenal 2-0 earlier today. The match will be tense with United looking for their first major trophy and City trying to boost their efforts for a top three finish. It will be tricky for both teams with United having the home advantage but City having history on their side. United have never beaten City since they re-formed in 2018. If United do get the win they will push the title race to the final day where they would need relegation-worry Reading to topple Chelsea. If Chelsea drew and United won, the title would come down to goal difference which Chelsea currently lead by six. The team news will be announced shortly so stay tuned ahead of kick-off at 6.45pmBST.

With almost every ballot counted it was clear that New Democracy had won a landslide, posting a 20-point margin – 40.8% – over the Syriza, which was trailing at just over 20.1% – a difference rarely seen since the collapse in 1974 of military rule. Even in Crete, a socialist bastion, the rightwing party had fared unexpectedly well. “It appears that New Democracy will have a very important victory,” said Giorgos Gerapetritis, a former state minister and one of Mitsotakis’s closest colleagues. “The Greek people took stock of the past and voted for the future … it voted for future generations.” Other government officials described the result as a “spectacular victory”. Under a new electoral system of proportional representation introduced under the former prime minister and Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras, the victor had to secure about 46% of the vote to win an outright majority of 151 seats in the 300-member parliament. That, for any party, had been an impossible feat. With 96% of the vote counted, smaller parties including MeRa25, headed by the country’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, failed to pass the 3% threshold to get into parliament. KKE, the communist party, came in with 7.2% of the vote, doing especially well in urban centres, with senior officials hailing the outcome as proof of the party’s ability to put up stiff opposition to “neoliberal” policies it has said are bringing Greeks to its knees. The inconclusive result will lay the ground for a fresh ballot in July if, as expected, efforts to form a coalition government break down. The second-round poll, expected on 2 July, will take place under a semi-proportional representation system that would grant the first party 50 bonus seats if it won 40% of the vote. On Monday, as protocol demands, Greece’s president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, will hand Mitsotakis a three-day mandate to explore the options of forming a coalition. Aides said the 55-year-old leader, who appeared in ebullient mood as he arrived at New Democracy’s headquarters in Athens, would prefer a repeat poll with Sunday’s result hardening his view that a single-party government was “more than possible”. In an address on Sunday night the prime minister said he was “proud and moved” by the result. “Hope has beaten pessimism, unity has beaten division,” Mitsotakis said. “I pledge to work even harder. People want a strong government with a four-year mandate so that we can cover the lost ground that separates us from Europe. A government is needed that really must believe in reforms so that it can implement them.” Throughout the electoral campaign he had insisted the country’s interests could only be served with “a strong majority” government that would enable him to press ahead with his reform programme during a second four-year term. If, as looks likely, Mitsotakis hands the mandate back to Sakellaropoulou, Syriza in theory will follow suit in trying to form a government, although the results did not suggest a “progressive alliance” would be arithmetically feasible even if leftist parties could find the consensus. It had been thought that the governing party’s popularity had been severely dented by a wiretapping scandal and devastating train crash – events that cast a pall over Mitsotakis, a former banker, personally. But Syriza’s unexpectedly poor performance appeared to uphold the view that Greeks had voted for stability – despite many being perturbed by what has been perceived as democratic backsliding under the centre-right government, with the spy scandal highlighting those concerns. In an election dominated by anxiety over the cost of living crisis, Greeks singled out the economy, citing memories of the nation’s debt drama a decade ago and punishing austerity meted out in return for emergency funds to keep the country afloat. Sunday’s ballot was the first since the EU and IMF, which orchestrated the biggest bailout in global financial history to avert a Greek default, ceased supervising the country’s finances. But trauma still lingers. The cuts demanded in exchange for rescue exacted a heavy price: the Greek economy contracted by more than 25%, beginning a recession from which the nation has only begun to recover. “The idea of more adventures after everything we have been through swayed my vote,” said Maria Lygera, echoing a common refrain. The 48-year-old was among a sizeable cohort of undecided voters estimated at close to 13% before polls opened. “Right until I walked into the ballot booth I wasn’t sure which way I would go,” she said. “I wanted to punish New Democracy because of the wiretapping scandal but equally I also wanted to ensure there is a centre-left party that is present and strong. Because that is definitely not Syriza, I voted Pasok.” The Pasok party came in third with just under 12%, a result its jubilant leadership said placed it on course to replace Syriza as the main centre-left opposition. Mitsotakis has promised to cut taxes further, bring down unemployment – hovering about 11%, from an all-time high of 30% during the crisis – and stimulate the economy by attracting more foreign direct investment. His election campaign motto has been “stability”, with the politician evoking the turbulence of Syriza’s time in office when Tsipras, its firebrand leader, was catapulted into power in 2015. Tsipras, 48, has toned down the radical rhetoric that first appealed to his base but throughout the election campaign vowed to raise public sector wages to help assuage the effects of the cost of living crisis and upgrade state facilities including the public health system. Senior Syriza cadres described the outcome as deeply disappointing and a far cry from what the leftwing party had hoped to achieve. “The result is extremely negative for Syriza,” Tsipras said on Sunday night, announcing immediate changes in the party. More than 9 million Greeks were eligible to cast ballots in a vote held under a rarely used proportional representation system. In an historic step Greeks abroad were also able to participate at polling stations set up in the UK and cities across Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. Voter turnout was said to be high among the more than 22,000 diaspora Greeks registered on the electoral roll. But from the outset the new electoral procedure had made it practically impossible for any candidate to win the 46% required to form a single-party government. Not since 1981, when Andreas Papandreou charged to victory on the slogan of allagi or “change”, has that feat been pulled off. With such high probability of the result being inconclusive, Mitsotakis had raised the spectre of a follow-up election in July even before Greeks began to cast their ballots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/21/manchester-united-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T20:00:54Z","webTitle":"Lucía García keeps Manchester United’s WSL title hopes alive with derby winner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/manchester-united-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/21/manchester-united-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Lucía García keeps Manchester United’s WSL title hopes alive with derby winner","bodyText":"The Women’s Super League title race will go to the final day of the season after an injury-time winner from Lucía García gave Manchester United victory against their rivals Manchester City. United needed to win to keep their hopes alive after Chelsea had defeated Arsenal earlier on Sunday but it looked like they would fall short, despite playing more than half the match against 10 players after the goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck was dismissed, until the substitute García created bedlam in Leigh. There was a record attendance for a United women’s match at Leigh and the raucous home fans had plenty to cheer about within two minutes; City failed to clear the ball properly twice, allowing it to land at Hayley Ladd’s feet 20 yards from goal from where she picked her spot in the top corner to beat an unmoved Roebuck. City were barely in the match in the opening stages; before five minutes had elapsed United could have scored three times. City were unable to cope with United’s energy as they desperately tried to rid themselves of the memory of defeat at Wembley last weekend, while keen to take the title race to the final day. United targeted Yui Hasegawa in the City midfield, permitting her no time in possession. The Japan international is the person who gets City going with her quick passing and energy but she was hounded whenever the ball went near her, putting Hasegawa and City on the back foot unable to play through United as is their desire. Considering City had a Champions League spot to play for and the chance to end the title challenge of their main rivals, they looked naive. They allowed United to keep possession with ease, switched off for short corners and aimed clearances to no one, meaning the ball came straight back at them. With this result City’s Champions League chances have not evaporated, but on the final day they will need an 11-goal swing on goal difference. It took 20 minutes for the match to turn into a contest. In quick succession, Khadija Shaw had a goalbound shot from eight yards blocked and Chloe Kelly assaulted the post with a volley. This brought new-found confidence to City, who turned the United defence questions to answers but they stoically held their own. The England head coach, Sarina Wiegman, was in the stands, eager to see who is in form going into the World Cup this summer but equally to ensure no more of her potential call-ups are injured. Nikita Parris will be hoping her performance put her into Wiegman’s thoughts for the tournament. The winger was a constant danger against Leila Ouahabi, who struggled to deal with her pace and movement. City were reduced to 10 players when she ran through to be confronted by a sliding Roebuck but the goalkeeper completely mistimed her challenge outside the box and was immediately sent off, forcing Gareth Taylor to bring on the 18-year-old Khiara Keating on the stroke of half-time. It was an unnecessary foul to make and a dreadful decision from Roebuck that will not have impressed David de Gea in the stands. An entire second half being a player light looked a difficult ask for City but they were at their finest to threaten United. Their style became more direct, aiming to get the ball to Shaw and for her to hold it up in the hope of bringing teammates in play or using her physicality to earn free-kicks in dangerous positions. One such set-piece almost brought the equaliser when the former United player Alex Greenwood whipped in a cross from the left, allowing Kelly to flick it goalwards but the bar rescued United. United were almost out of sight when Alessia Russo broke down the right and fired across for Leah Galton but the outstretched leg of the United winger was not long enough to slide the ball home. City were becoming increasingly stretched, tired by the work they were being made to do under the Leigh sunshine. The United pain was doubled when City secured a surprise equaliser through Filippa Angeldahl. The City midfielder retrieved a cleared corner and crossed it back into the box from close to the byline, only to see it deceive Mary Earps and land inside the far post. It would have been a tragicomedy end to United’s title challenge but Earps was spared. United had to wait until injury-time for their saviour to come to the fore when García made no mistake on this occasion inside the box, sweeping a knockdown into the corner, although it took a deflection, eventually trickling into the corner before the crowd erupted. All United need to do now is beat Liverpool away and hope Chelsea slip up against the bottom club Reading.

The lawsuit filed on Friday claims two officers stood outside Christina Yuna Lee’s apartment in Chinatown while she was being stabbed to death by an unhoused man who followed her into her building as she returned home in the early morning. Even though neighbors had called 911 early on during the attack and two officers arrived promptly, they waited 80 minutes to go inside her apartment. Once inside, they recovered her brutally stabbed body in her bathtub, and found her killer Assamad Nash hiding under a bed. He was arrested after trying to flee through a window. Friday’s lawsuit and others like it can generally be difficult to win for plaintiffs. While carrying out their duties, police officers and other first responders are generally afforded qualified immunity, which protects them from civil liability for any actions that do not expressly violate a clearly established constitutional right. Meanwhile, courts have previously found that police officers are not legally duty bound to provide protection to citizens even if they call upon them for help. The lawsuit nonetheless seeks damages for Lee’s family in connection with her death, and it also demands that New York police be held liable for failing to keep her neighborhood safe. The lawsuit makes reference to the 2021 killing of delivery driver Sala Miah in a park near Lee’s residence. His face had been slashed, he had stab wounds to his stomach and his bike had been stolen. “By failing to control dangerous conditions in Sara D Roosevelt Park, [police] intentionally, recklessly, and negligently created a nuisance,” the suit said, according to the Daily Beast. Lee was a creative producer for a music platform, and her death was the second of two high-profile murders of Asian American women in quick succession at the beginning of 2022. Her killing took place less than a month after another man pushed Michelle Alyssa Go in front of an oncoming train in Manhattan. The murders took place amid a wider rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans across the country after the illness which drove the Covid pandemic was first detected in China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/a-second-reprieve-for-suella-braverman-could-be-a-tall-order","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T19:41:11Z","webTitle":"A second reprieve for Suella Braverman could be a tall order","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/a-second-reprieve-for-suella-braverman-could-be-a-tall-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/a-second-reprieve-for-suella-braverman-could-be-a-tall-order","fields":{"headline":"A second reprieve for Suella Braverman could be a tall order","bodyText":"When Suella Braverman’s career as home secretary was last on the ropes – for sending an official document from her personal email in a serious breach of the rules – she received little support from cabinet minsters. “She’s a joke,” one said at the time. “She shouldn’t be anywhere near high office.” Yet within six days she was back in the job, after Rishi Sunak calculated that it was worth reinstating the leading rightwinger to the Home Office to win her support for the Tory leadership bid which brought him to No 10. It has not been a smooth path. Within days of being back at the Home Office, she was fighting for her job for a second time after she was accused – and denied – ignoring legal advice on keeping asylum seekers at the overcrowded Manston immigration centre in Kent. As she battled for her survival in the Commons, she angered critics, as well as some on her own side, with her incendiary claim that asylum seekers crossing the Channel in dinghies constituted an “invasion of our southern coast”. She also bemoaned a “broken” system which meant that “illegal migration is out of control”, with no acknowledgment of who had been running the country over the previous 13 years. The following months brought more hard rhetoric on immigration, as the government’s headline bill made its way through parliament, and a trip to Rwanda where she made an off-colour joke that she was so impressed by the decor of the homes being built for asylum seekers deported from the UK that she could use the interior designer. Yet migrants aren’t the only ones caught up in Braverman’s culture war: environmental protesters, human rights activists and equal rights campaigners have all been in her sights too. The passage of time, and seven months back in the job, has done little to ease frustration towards the home secretary among her Conservative colleagues. Just last week, despairing Tory MPs accused her of undermining Sunak’s authority and making a bid for the future leadership of the party with a partisan speech at the NatCon conference. Tory MPs privately condemned her. “Rishi needs to make it clear to her that she is either a team player or a backbencher,” said one. The latest row over whether she broke the ministerial code by requesting a private speeding awareness course is seen as a spectacular own goal – with several MPs saying she would deserve her fate if it costs her her job for a second time. Even Downing Street insiders now may be starting to go cool, with one telling the Guardian there is “no appetite” in No 10 to defend the home secretary and Sunak himself stopping short of saying he had full confidence in her. This failure to give Braverman the benefit of the doubt on the speeding course row is in stark contrast to Sunak’s apparent determination to stand by other beleaguered ministers, including his former deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, until the very end. “It’s all about delivery,” says one Tory insider. “If she can get net migration down and start getting to grips with the small boats crisis, then she’ll prove her detractors wrong. But does anybody really think either of those are possible?” In the meantime, the judgment of Sunak, who by now is surely regretting promising “integrity, professionalism and accountability” at every level of government when he took office, is once again under question."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/21/disabled-woman-forced-to-sleep-in-hotel-dining-area-after-booked-room-was-unavailable","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T19:05:47Z","webTitle":"Disabled woman forced to sleep in hotel dining area ‘after booked room was unavailable’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/21/disabled-woman-forced-to-sleep-in-hotel-dining-area-after-booked-room-was-unavailable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/21/disabled-woman-forced-to-sleep-in-hotel-dining-area-after-booked-room-was-unavailable","fields":{"headline":"Disabled woman forced to sleep in hotel dining area ‘after booked room was unavailable’","bodyText":"A disabled wheelchair user who requires a ventilator at night had to sleep on a sofa in a hotel dining room because the accessible room she booked was not available. Kat Watkins, 36, a UN convention on the rights of disabled people development officer at Disability Wales, who has brittle bone disease and sleep apnoea, said she is suffering from severe back pain as a result of not being able to sleep in the bed she had booked and paid for at a Travelodge hotel in Hounslow. Travelodge has “sincerely apologised” to her. Watkins had carefully planned her trip from south Wales to London to attend a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, where the singer songwriter and guitarist James Bay was performing on 26 April. She travelled in her adapted mobility van with her personal assistant on the day of the concert. She had booked a twin bedded room at the hotel for herself and her PA. Watkins had stayed there previously and had had a good experience. She had mapped her route to the concert on public transport going from Hounslow East to Earl’s Court – both accessible tube stations – with a taxi for the final leg of the journey. On arrival at the hotel at 3pm, she and her PA were informed that the room Watkins had booked was no longer available because all the accessible rooms were “out of order”. When Watkins later asked why she said she was told by a member of staff it was because the rooms had not been cleaned. She was offered two alternatives: a family room where her wheelchair could not fit into the bathroom, or an alternative Travelodge hotel in Twickenham which did have an accessible room available. She reluctantly accepted the family room and went off to the concert. On her return to the hotel with her PA at 12.30am, she was told the family room was no longer available and that the receptionist would try to book a taxi that could accommodate a wheelchair to take her to the Twickenham Travelodge. But despite repeated attempts by the receptionist to find a taxi that could accommodate a wheelchair, none could be found. Watkins and her PA said they had no choice but to sleep on two uncomfortable sofas in the Hounslow Travelodge dining room, finally bedding down about 2.30am. “I was struggling to breathe. I use a ventilator at night and my breathing was becoming more and more shallow,” said Watkins. “The concert I attended was good but I can’t look back on it with fond memories because the experience I had was so traumatic. I have never experienced anything as horrendous as this before. I don’t even know how to say how bad it was. It was off the scale. I’ve been in agony with my back since that night. I’ve told Travelodge I won’t be using their hotels again.” Alex Osborne, disability equality officer at Disability Wales, said: “Kat’s experience was particularly bad, however we have many examples from our members, and my colleagues, of very poor service in hotels.” Osborne said they hear frequently of disabled people encountering problems with rooms, even though accessible rooms have been pre-booked. “Many still find themselves being put in other non-accessible rooms due to double bookings. This causes a lot of stress to the disabled person, impacting not only their holiday/break but also in many instances causing pain when the disabled person has to stay in a room which is not suitable,” she said. A Travelodge spokesperson said: “We would like to sincerely apologise to Ms Kat Watkins and her PA for their recent experience with us. On this rare occasion we failed to meet our normal high standard of service. We should have informed Ms Watkins ahead of checking-in that her room was out of order and that we had moved her booking to one of our nearby hotels. “We are very sorry for the inconvenience of this miscommunication and we have refunded the booking in full and offered an e-voucher for a future stay. We hope that we can welcome back Ms Watkins and reinstate her faith in our brand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/may/21/stylist-extraordinaire-worlds-of-literature-and-politics-pay-tribute-to-martin-amis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T18:42:25Z","webTitle":"‘Stylist extraordinaire’: worlds of literature and politics pay tribute to Martin Amis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/21/stylist-extraordinaire-worlds-of-literature-and-politics-pay-tribute-to-martin-amis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/21/stylist-extraordinaire-worlds-of-literature-and-politics-pay-tribute-to-martin-amis","fields":{"headline":"‘Stylist extraordinaire’: worlds of literature and politics pay tribute to Martin Amis","bodyText":"Salman Rushdie has led tributes to Martin Amis after the celebrated author died aged 73. Rushdie said Amis, who died at his home in Florida on Saturday, had a unique literary voice and that “it was unwise to try to imitate him”, adding in a piece for the New Yorker: “He used to say that what he wanted to do was leave behind a shelf of books – to be able to say: ‘From here to here, it’s me.’ His voice is silent now. His friends will miss him terribly. But we have the shelf.” That shelf includes 15 novels, including Money, London Fields, 2014’s Zone of Interest, the film adaptation of which opened at the Cannes film festival this week, and his last novel, Inside Story, published in 2020. The death of Amis, who had been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer – the same illness that killed his friend, the author and journalist Christopher Hitchens, in 2011 – brought widespread dismay in publishing and beyond. His UK editor, Michal Shavit, said: “It’s hard to imagine a world without Martin Amis in it. He was the king – a stylist extraordinaire, super cool, a brilliantly witty, erudite and fearless writer, and a truly wonderful man. “He has been so important and formative for so many readers and writers over the last half century. Every time he published a new book it was an event. He will be remembered as one of the greatest writers of his time.” Amis’s agent, Andrew Wylie, told the Guardian: “The level of attention Martin brought to each sentence was unique and special. He played on a field that few writers visited.” “Amis was a princeling writer, fully serious, always careless, sometimes hurtful,” said the novelist Anne Enright. “Libidinous, propulsive, hilarious: I loved the feeling of possibility his discordant syntax released in the reader. “Pick up an Amis book and you too could be The Man. The voices of his fictions freed the voice in other writers’ work, including my own. There was something about his confidence that was contagious and liberating.” The novelist John Niven prompted Twitter users to post their favourite excerpts from Amis’s novels when he posted that the author’s death had “hit me hard” and began to tweet lines from them. The physicist Brian Cox responded by saying: “Scrolling through Twitter is worth it for once – it’s one remarkable paragraph after another.” The former prime minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he was “shocked and sad at the death of Martin Amis – the greatest, darkest, funniest satirist since Evelyn Waugh. If you want cheering up, re-read the tennis match in Money.” Amis was born on 25 August 1949, in Oxford, to the Booker prize-winning novelist Kingsley Amis and Hilary Ann Bardwell. After graduating from Exeter College, Oxford, he embarked on a series of journalism jobs at the Times Literary Supplement and New Statesman, before publishing his debut, The Rachel Papers, in 1973. In an interview with the Paris Review in 1998, Amis described his philosophy of fiction writing: “Plots really matter only in thrillers. In mainstream writing the plot is – what is it? A hook. The reader is going to wonder how things turn out. In this respect, Money was a much more difficult book to write than London Fields because it is essentially a plotless novel. It is what I would call a voice novel. If the voice doesn’t work you’re screwed.” Amis’s love of language over plot and narrative was highlighted by many mourning his death. The journalist and broadcaster Emily Maitlis said: “I am quietly devastated. Actually just loved the way he loved words. Dark, bleak and brilliantly funny. I grew up on #MartinAmis and will be for ever grateful.” The actor and writer Steve Martin said: “When I was a young-er writer, I was at a small dinner with Martin Amis. A writer’s name came up and Martin said, casually: ‘Well, he’s a sloppy writer.’ I said: ‘What makes a sloppy writer?’ He said: ‘Unintended alliteration, accidental rhyme, repetition of words.’” Enright told the Guardian: “It was fun to see his generation assert themselves in some new way against ponderous authority. Amis did it by voice alone. He made you feel that an act of expression was enough, more than enough – it had its own force and integrity, it had style.” Amis, who was married to the American writer Isabel Fonseca, bought a brownstone residence in Brooklyn, New York, in 2010 and said the following year that he was leaving London to live in the US permanently. He also bought a house in Lake Worth, Florida, where he was staying when he died. In an interview with the Guardian in 2017, he said he missed the English, and Londoners especially: “I miss the wit … Americans aren’t as witty as Brits, because humour is about giving a little bit of offence. It’s an assertion of intellectual superiority.” Tributes poured in from around the world and across the political divide. In Germany, the liberal-leaning Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper referred to Amis as “one of the most important contemporary British authors”, recalling the controversy that The Zone of Interest, which is set in Auschwitz, caused in Germany, leading to its rejection by the leading publishing house Hanser in 2015. The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Amis was “one of the greatest writers of the past hundred years”, who “polarised with his ruthless opinions but whose novels of the 80s and 90s are regarded as groundbreaking for the English-language literary scene”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/rishi-sunak-under-pressure-to-launch-ethics-probe-over-suella-braverman-speeding-row","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T18:39:11Z","webTitle":"Sunak under pressure to launch ethics inquiry over Braverman speeding row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/rishi-sunak-under-pressure-to-launch-ethics-probe-over-suella-braverman-speeding-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/rishi-sunak-under-pressure-to-launch-ethics-probe-over-suella-braverman-speeding-row","fields":{"headline":"Sunak under pressure to launch ethics inquiry over Braverman speeding row","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure to launch an investigation into whether Suella Braverman broke the ministerial code by requesting a private speed awareness course, as Downing Street appeared to distance itself from the beleaguered home secretary. The prime minister arrives back from the G7 summit in Japan to a growing political storm over whether Braverman breached strict rules by asking Home Office civil servants for special treatment after she was caught breaking the speed limit. He will have to quickly determine whether to ask his ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate. Downing Street confirmed Sunak will consult with Magnus when he returns from Japan. Braverman is due to appear before MPs for Home Office questions on Monday, Labour is expected to table an urgent question and Conservative ministers, MPs and aides are in mutinous mood over her survival. One senior Tory source said there was “no appetite” in No 10 to defend the home secretary. “It’s a totally unforced error,” they added. Downing Street insiders even suggested they were content with Braverman “blowing herself up”, but said there was not yet an appetite to make an overt move against her. At a press conference at the end of the G7 summit, the clearly frustrated prime minister ignored questions about whether he should order an ethics inquiry into Braverman’s conduct but stopped short of saying he had full confidence in her. Sunak told reporters that he had not spoken to the home secretary after the revelations and claimed he did not know the details. However, he added: “I understand she has expressed regret for speeding, accepted the penalty and paid the fine.” Yet the prime minister is certain to face questions when he lands in the UK over whether he was aware of the home secretary’s attempts to arrange a private speed awareness course. The cabinet secretary, Simon Case, is not believed to have been aware of the matter. Under the proposal, Braverman would not have had to attend an in-person course with other motorists, or an online one where her name and face would be visible on camera to other participants. Sources claimed that Home Office officials emailed the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team to ask whether they could advise the home secretary. They were immediately told they could not. When the civil servants refused to help, Braverman is believed to have turned to a political aide who tried to persuade the course provider to agree to the proposal. When they declined, she opted to take the three points on her licence and pay the fine instead. One source said that the Home Office had pushed to release a statement at the weekend, in advance of revelations published in the Sunday Times, saying that Braverman had followed due process by seeking appropriate advice from officials. However, there was “strong pushback” from No 10, which felt it needed more time to establish the facts. The Cabinet Office would usually be responsible for statements on such issues. The former Tory party chair Jake Berry said Braverman had “questions to answer”. Sources close to Braverman suggested that she had simply asked officials for advice on how to arrange a driving awareness course. This is understood to have included raising the possibility of a private course, although it has been denied that she directed them. The prime minister’s ethics adviser could request all emails and messages sent between departments if he is asked to investigate the matter. One source said that Braverman’s request to officials was in email form, meaning Magnus could see it. Ministers are banned from directing civil servants to help with their personal affairs under the code, which states that they have a personal obligation to ensure that “no conflict arises, or appears to arise between their personal interests and public duties”. They are also expected to abide by the Nolan principles of public life, which set ethical standards for ministers and are written into the ministerial code. There is now a range of sanctions available for ministers who are in breach. Dave Penman of the FDA union, which represents senior officials, said: “Any approach to civil servants on what is a purely personal matter is inappropriate, but as a former attorney general and as the current home secretary, Braverman should be aware of the implications of asking civil servants’ advice or to intervene on this issue and the obvious conflicts of interest that arise. “That Home Office civil servants appear to have sought advice from the Cabinet Office, and subsequently refused the request, would suggest that serious concerns were being raised by this. “As sole arbiter of the ministerial code, the prime minister alone gets to decide whether there is an investigation. This raises questions once again about what he knew about his minister’s conduct and when.” The home secretary has already been sacked once from the role under Liz Truss, because she sent an official document from her personal email to a fellow MP in a serious breach of ministerial rules. Sunak reappointed her six days later. However, it could be problematic for the prime minister to have his home secretary in peril the same week that the latest migration statistics are expected to show that net legal migration has risen from 500,000 and hit an all-time record. On his final day at the G7 summit, Sunak said that he thought overall migration numbers were “too high” and said he was “committed to bringing them down”. He had earlier set a new goal of bringing migration down below the level he “inherited”, which was about 500,000 net arrivals a year when he became prime minister. The Guardian has learned that Braverman tried to get out of the final Commons vote on the government’s small boats bill despite Conservative MPs being instructed to attend on a three-line whip. The home secretary’s aides sent multiple emails over the course of several days to the Tory whips’ office requesting that she be slipped for the third reading of her department’s headline legislation. Sources said that the chief whip, Simon Hart, had to call Braverman directly to instruct her to attend the vote on the illegal migration bill.

At non-league finals day, the double header that has become a rich addition (spiritually if not financially) to the English football calendar, Kai Walters of Ascot United and Jamie Cooke of FC Halifax Town were carved on to the list of players who have lived the ultimate childhood daydream by scoring a winning goal at Wembley. Non-league finals day, which started in 2016, is an opportunity for four teams from outside the English Football League to see how the other half live. It combines the finals of the FA Vase, the knockout trophy for teams in tiers nine and 10 of English men’s football, and the FA Trophy (tiers five to eight). There’s none of the entitlement and ennui you sometimes see when the biggest clubs return to Wembley, and the mood around the stadium is subtly different: eyes are a little wider, smiles a little broader, songs a little lustier. At the end of a long day, it was the supporters of Halifax who were making all the noise. Their team won the FA Trophy for the second time, beating a gallant but weary Gateshead Town 1-0. Gateshead, who were without 14 senior players, had a lot of possession but Halifax were a study in defensive excellence. Their goal came just before half-time when Louis Storey, oblivious to the presence of Cooke behind him, played a blind backpass to the goalkeeper James Montgomery. His desperate clearance hit Cooke’s outstretched leg and time stood still before the ball gently rippled the net. “It’s every kid’s dream to play at this stadium,” Cooke said. “To score the winner and for us to play as well as we have, it means the world to us. We were here in 2016 [when they won the FA Trophy for the first time] and to do the same again – 1-0, clean sheet, never lost at Wembley – is absolutely huge.” For most of the teams involved, non-league finals day isn’t the highlight of the season; it’s the highlight of the decade, occasionally their entire history. Ascot United have certainly never had a season like 2022-23. They won the Combined Counties League at a canter, collecting 102 points from 38 games, and completed their own version of the double in the first match of the day. Ascot, playing at Wembley for the first time, beat the holders, Newport Pagnell Town, 1-0 in a game of painfully fine margins. It was settled in the 80th minute when the substitute Walters produced a deft near-post header from the outstanding Sean McCormack’s cross. “You know what, I’ve been manifesting this for years, dreaming about it,” Walters said. “As soon as Sean had the ball on the right I knew he’d whip it in, because that’s what he does, and luckily I put it in.” While the Ascot team ran over to get tactile with their supporters at the final whistle, the hugs and high-fives symbolising the connection between players and fans at this level, a tearful Jake Watkinson barely registered his teammates’ attempts to console him. Watkinson, the Newport Pagnell striker, missed the best chance of the game at 0-0, screwing Albie Hall’s cross wide from six yards. Watkinson scored 26 goals this season but the 27th, the one he didn’t score, will be the one that stays with him. At Wembley, the emotions are always extreme – no matter which part of the football pyramid you come from."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2023/may/21/surrey-v-kent-sussex-v-glamorgan-and-more-county-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T18:21:19Z","webTitle":"Michael Neser hits 123 as Glamorgan pile up runs in Sussex draw – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/may/21/surrey-v-kent-sussex-v-glamorgan-and-more-county-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2023/may/21/surrey-v-kent-sussex-v-glamorgan-and-more-county-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"Michael Neser hits 123 as Glamorgan pile up runs in Sussex draw – as it happened","bodyText":"With the first seven-week block of Championship matches over, and the international summer stretching ahead, Australia’s county visitors are nicely warmed up. Michael Neser topped off his time at Glamorgan, which already included 17 wickets and two fifties, with 123 as Glamorgan amassed 737 against Sussex – their second highest-total in history. He, and Surrey’s Sean Abbott (264 runs at 52, and 16 wickets), both left out of the original Australian 15, have been called into the pre-Ashes training camp and will stroll in bright eyed and bushy tailed. Glamorgan batted for most of the day as Sussex struggled to maintain any pressure on a well-behaved pitch, hamstrung by the absence of England’s Ollie Robinson who walked off the field on Saturday lunchtime, never to return. He was spotted hobbling around on crutches, and wearing a protective boot, prior to a scan on his dodgy left ankle on Monday. Kiran Carlson was finally out for a brilliant and career-best 192, but Neser ensured that his captain’s innings was not in vain. He dropped to one knee to pancake Steve Smith for six to reach his century, but Smith, bowling in sunglasses, shirt untucked, got his revenge, deceiving him with a floating pie. There was time for one over in Sussex’s innings before handshakes, bowled by Marnus Labuschagne – who declared himself “pretty happy where his game is”. England have been warned. At Bristol, Australia’s Marcus Harris carried his bat for a back-against-the-wall 122 – his second of the season – but it wasn’t enough to prevent Gloucestershire falling to a 125-run defeat to Durham. The New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel, wicketless in his first appearance against Yorkshire, collected five for 96 and 10 wickets in the match. It was Durham’s fourth win in six games and they survey all below them at the top of the Division Two table, 29 points above Sussex. The Bazball approach, inspired by one of their own sons, has proved inspirational. “Durham cricket on top of a ladder is a pretty good thing to see,” said Ryan Campbell, the head coach, afterwards. “I was brought up at a time when there were great players in Sheffield Shield cricket and the only way you could hope to win was by being positive.” At Trent Bridge, a bold declaration by Essex, leaving Notts to chase 219 in 39 overs, never quite ignited with Nottinghamshire losing a couple of early wickets and watchful of the circling Simon Harmer, a cluster of close fielders at his beck and call. He had removed both Matthew Montgomery and Lyndon James, and Notts were 97 for four, when the captains agreed to call it a day. Earlier, there had been a fond standing ovation for Alastair Cook, snaffled behind the stumps for 99, that first hundred at Trent Bridge still eluding him. Tom Westley made 95 and Dan Lawrence 52 to tuck away and take with him into the England squad. Australia’s players, who have enriched this early summer of the Championship, carry their spoils as well. And that, my friends, is that! Thank you all for your company over the last seven weeks – I leave you with Surrey riding high at the top of Division One, and Durham surveying all below them at the top of Division Two. We’ll be back on June 11, till then, good bye! Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 442 and 97-4 DRAW with Essex 298 and362-8dec A bold declaration by Essex, and nicely pursued by Notts until the wickets became too many. Essex seven points, Notts eleven points. Four close fielders breathe down Lyndon James’s neck – and he’s bowled! Dropped the over before, he steps back to force the ball into the offside and is Harmered for 10. Notts: 70-4 with 15 and a bit overs to go. Joe Clarke still there on 26. Just the one game, keeping us on tenterhooks to the very end. Eyes to Trent Bridge where Simon Harmer has his first, Montgomery lbw for 11. Notts 50-3, need another 169 in 21 overs. I’m going to start to write up, but will be back. Sussex 481 and 1-0 DRAW with Glamorgan 123 and 737! Marnus Labuschagne bowls the one and only over in Sussex’s second innings and they shake hands. A quiet end to a helluva match: Glamorgan overturning a 358-run first-innings deficit to draw the game. Centuries for boy with a future, James Coles, Marnus Labuschagne, Kiran Carlson and Michael Neser. Sussex hamstrung by an ankle injury to Ollie Robinson which meant he couldn’t bowl after lunch on the third day. Farewell and thank you, to Michael Neser, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. You brightened the early summer. See you in a baggy green sometime soon. In the dying embers of the match, Neser swipes and loses his bails. Sussex must face on over before handshakes. Glamorgan, finally, 737 all out. Three fours to Joe Clarke – he and Montgomery a dangerous partnership. Notts 29-2 from 12. Here we go… Ooof! Sam Cook has another, Slater almost cut in half as the ball zips in and removes the off bail! Notts 12-2. Notts not taking any chances against Jamie Porter, who has bowled three overs for two runs. Notts 12 for one from eight overs. They’ve taken tea at Hove, with Glamorgan a mere 730-9 – their second highest total in history. Only the 795-5 declared against Leicester last year – the Sam Northeast game - lies ahead. Right, so,… Notts one down already, and it is Has, for seven. One four, I assume gentle yet commanding. Notts 11-1, Sam Cook the wicket taker. How long till Harmer-time? Just going to grab a quick cup of tea for five minutes. Odds on the nighthawk hitting the winning runs? Some rocket fuel with my tea and digestives please. Take that vice captain! On one knee, over mid-off, out of the ground, lost ball, as Smith applauds with (I think) a smile. 14 from the over, the total ticks over 700 – Glamorgan’s third highest score in history. DIVISION ONE The Rose Bowl: Hampshire 367 BEAT Northamptonshire 56 and 176 Lord’s: Somerset 404 BEAT Middlesex 175 and 216 by an innings and 13 runs. Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 442 v Essex 298 and362-8 Essex lead by 218 The Oval: Surrey 362 and 58-0 BEAT Kent 278 and 141 by ten wickets. DIVISION TWO Bristol: Gloucestershire 292 and 300 v Durham 445 and 272-4dec DURHAM WIN BY 125 RUNS Hove: Sussex 481 v Glamorgan 123 and 689-9 Glamorgan lead by 331 * playing the extra half hour as nine wickets down. New Road: Worcestershire 83 and 274-7 BEAT Leicestershire 173 and 180 by three wickets Snater is bowled for 18 – a third wicket for Harrison - and they take tea at Trent Bridge. Thanks to BBC radio for doing the maths and confirming that if Glamorgan’s last wicket was to fall now at Hove, Sussex would have to score 11 an over to win. Steve Smith, bowling in sunglasses, shirt untucked, delivers a series of floating pies. Glamorgan 688-9. Shane Snater has the final day why-nots, and thwacks two sixes from his first two balls. Bracewell out for four. Essex 352-7, lead by 208. to make Glamorgan nine down. Sussex in touching distance of batting again. James Harris pulls the ball high and just in touching distance of Sean Hunt, substitute fielder on the boundary. Glamorgan 671-9, with a session and a squeeze to go. The lead, 313. But presumably Pujara can’t bat…. So perhaps the Trent Bridge match is going to be the nail-biter. Lawrence gone, just after passing fifty, lbw to Mullaney. A crucial wicket – up to Harmer and Doug Bracewell to bat it out now. Shane Snater, Sam Cook and Jamie Porter to come. Essex 323-6, the lead just 179. Ryan Campbell, Durham’s head coach, is happy: “I impressed on Marcus North (Director of Cricket) the importance of adding a quality spinner to our ranks and Ajaz Patel has been brilliant for us. “Durham cricket on top of a ladder is a pretty good thing to see. I was brought up a time when there were great players in Sheffield Shield cricket and the only way you could hope to win was by being positive. “Our batters have embraced that attitude and even Alex Lees, who hasn’t yet made the mountain of runs we expect from him, has picked up the baton over how we want to play. “There are some massive tests to come, with some injuries and Matthew Potts having been picked by England, but that will serve to give others a chance.” This doesn’t sound overwhelmingly good: Glamorgan bat on and on and on. Neser 64, Harris 13: Glamorgan 651-8 – the lead 293. Cheteshwar Pujara hasn’t taken the field today, with a stiff neck. Oh. Another, as Rossington goes cheaply, a brain-freeze, chipping Calvin Harrison back into his belly. Essex 309-5, the lead 165. Wake up, wake up! A wicket! Matt Critchley bowled for 20, off stump ahoy, a third wicket for Lyndon James. Essex 308-4, lead Notts by 164. Dan Lawrence is 32 not out at Trent Bridge, in a game drifting to early handshakes, this a chance for him to shine after being named in the Test squad against Ireland. In his 11 Tests to date, he’s gathered 551 runs, averaging 29. In 2017 he was named Young Cricketer of the Year by the Cricket Writers’ Club and made his Lions debut. He made a duck in his last Test innings, in Grenada, at the fag end of Joe Root’s reign as captain, but had made his highest score of 91 in the previous Test at Barbados. Then he fell through the cracks. Somewhere is a great interview with him by Wisden’s Phil Walker , but unhelpfully I can’t locate it right now. You may have more luck. The game at Hove is creeping towards the action part. Timm van der Gugten has just become Karvelas’s second wicket, and Michael Neser (56) is joined by James Harris. Glamorgan now a ridiculous 624-8, the lead 266. Thank you to Paul Bolton for tipping me off that today is National Counties T20 finals day at Tring Park. Staffordshire opener Nils Priestley, who was released by Derbyshire at end of last season, has just bashed 147 not out from 66 balls with ten sixes and 12 fours in first semi- final against v Berkshire. His century came from just 41 balls. It is the highest individual score in the competition, and Staff’s final score, 252-2, is the second highest total in the competition. Staffs won by 68 runs and now face either Cornwall or Hertfordshire in the final later today. Stuart Broad is opening the bowling at Trent Bridge after lunch, to keep the interest of England fans right to the end of this block of games. White headband, elbows pumping, he runs in. A bee buzzes round the kitchen and out of the back door on a perfect still May afternoon. Bristol: Gloucestershire 292 and 300 v Durham 445 and 272-4dec DURHAM WIN BY 125 RUNS That all happened quite quickly in the end. Ajaz Patel 5-96 and ten wickets in the match. Marcus Harris finished 132 not out - the first GLos batsman to carry his bat since Cameron Bancroft made an unbeaten 206 against Kent in 2017. Durham hip-hip-horraying it at the top of Division Two. DIVISION ONE The Rose Bowl: Hampshire 367 BEAT Northamptonshire 56 and 176 Lord’s: Somerset 404 BEAT Middlesex 175 and 216 by an innings and 13 runs. Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 442 v Essex 298 and 258-3 The Oval: Surrey 362 and 58-0 BEAT Kent 278 and 141 by ten wickets. DIVISION TWO Bristol: Gloucestershire 292 and 300 v Durham 445 and 272-4dec DURHAM WIN BY 125 RUNS Hove: Sussex 481 v Glamorgan 123 and 603-7 New Road: Worcestershire 83 and 274-7 BEAT Leicestershire 173 and 180 by three wickets A wicket at Hove… and it is Chris Cooke, for 45 to Tom Haines. But Glamorgan stretch on, the total now their record for a second innings – beating the previous record of 577-4 vs Gloucestershire at Newport in 1939. Glam:582-7, the lead 224 over Sussex. Just catching up on the Blast-off and another SACA debut, this time Jafer Chohan, who boldly bished 37 off 20 balls at No. 10 and bowled two overs, as Yorkshire hit another road-block, this time in white ball cricket. Birmingham Bears win by 34 runs. Jonny Bairstow made seven. In the other game, Lancs finally added a win to their string of early season Championship draws, beating Derbyshire by four wickets. Michael Neser also taking the opportunity to remind Smith of his batting prowess, has hit five fours in his 25. Glam 568-6, lead of 211. Don’t think there are any real daemons for Sussex to fear if they have to run-chase later. Vice captain Steve Smith scribbles approvingly in his notebook – that’s backs-against-the-wall hundreds for both Labuschagne and Harris in the pre-Ashes summer. Harris’s hundred came from 163 balls and was his second of the season. Gloucestershire 257-7 – can I mention that victory is only 169 runs away? Time to channel your inner Worcestershire. Alas, still no Trent Bridge century for Cook. Snaffled behind the stumps by Joe Clarke, for 99. Note Tom Westley turning away at the non-striker’s end in that feeling of sympathy/loss for words/embarrassment. Slow going at Trent Bridge, but Alastair Cook is in the no-sweat zone. Essex 209-1, Cook and Westley 91 and 76 respectively. That, my friends, is curtains for Glammy I fear. A crestfallen Carlson caught and bowled Aristides Karvelas for a career-best and fabulous 192. Glamorgan: 510-6, lead by 152. Marcus Harris, the forgotten Australian playing county cricket, is 83 not out at Bristol, and very much Gloucestershire’s last chance of surviving. Glos 202-7 (Taylor just lbw to Ajaz Patel) and needs to bat at both ends all day. That Test squad in full for the WTC final and the first two Ashes Tests: Pat Cummins (captain), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Todd Murphy, Matthew Renshaw, Steve Smith (vice-captain), Mitchell Starc, David Warner. Loving the fact that Marnus was “underwhelmed” by his 138 yesterday. Sussex desperately missed Ollie Robinson (ankle scan, pain when walking) yesterday. Thinking they will continue to desperately miss him during the rest of the summer too – though he is one who likes to keep bowling so they might get him back in September. At Hove, Carlson moves on to 190 and Chris Cooke to 14. Glamorgan 504-5, a lead of 146. Will Sir Alastair make his first century at Trent Bridge? I’m feeling yes in my bones, though admittedly they have been wrong before. Stuart Broad gets a last chance to grove his moves before the international summer starts. Essex 202-1, a lead of 58, and Notts in need of one of Broad’s magic spells to break the deadlock. Rest in peace Brian Booth – Australian cricket captain and Olympic hockey player . “If a prize were offered for fair play among Australia’s post-war cricketers, Brian Booth would win hands down.” Confused, out of touch with the IPL 2023? Don’t worry, Tim de Lisle is here with an excellent idiot’s guide: Glorious centuries by Marnus Labuschagne and Kiran Carlson at Hove were overshadowed by worries over the fitness of Ollie Robinson. The England player bowled an eight-over spell during the morning session but didn’t return after lunch. Paul Farbrace, Sussex’s head coach, confirmed after play that Robinson has a sore ankle, is going for a precautionary scan on Monday and is unlikely to bowl again in the match against Glamorgan. “It was precautionary. There was no point in making it worse.” Farbrace said. “It’s the walking more than the running in. He was all right running in down the slope. He did OK. It’s a joint decision between the Sussex medical team and the England medical team. Much as we want him out there bowling and taking wickets it’s not fair on him to make the injury worse.” Robinson’s warm up for the international summer had been going nicely, with 20 wickets in two and a bit Championship games, though he had to spend the last few overs of the match against Worcestershire in early May off the field suffering from cramp. Any injury to Robinson would be particularly worrying for England, whose fast-bowling stocks are increasingly crocked: Jofra Archer (elbow and out for the summer), Olly Stone (hamstring and out until at least the second Ashes Test), Brydon Carse (trunk strain) Jimmy Anderson (twinge to groin) and Ben Stokes (chronic left knee injury). Without Robinson, Sussex struggled to make headway against an increasingly confident Glamorgan. Labuschagne, buttons polished, hair brushed and Ashes ready, finished his Welsh mini-break with 502 runs in eight innings at an average of 71.71, including two hundreds and two fifties. It was a watchful innings at Hove, with occasional flourishes of brilliance, and he reached his century with two consecutive fours, a gorgeous cover drive and a pull. He was congratulated with a bear hug by Carlson; and applause by the slips, his teammates on the balcony and all round the ground. When he finally fell, for 138, it was to teenage century maker James Coles, who is having a match to remember. Carlson, the Glamorgan captain, came in on a hat-trick, but was 187 runs richer at stumps. He and Labuschagne had turned the game around. Surrey thrashed Kent by 10 wickets before lunch, going into the T20 Blast break on top of Division One, with four wins and a 25-point lead over second-placed Warwickshire (who have played a game less). Sam Billings collected a pair and Zak Crawley could only add three runs to his overnight score, as 20-year-old Tom Lawes pocketed his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. There was a warning to the chasing pack from a delighted Lawes. That’s how we want to play our cricket,” he said, “and we reckon there is still more to come from us as a team.” It was Kent’s third defeat of the summer. Liam Dawson was Northamptonshire’s bogey man as they slumped to their third consecutive defeat. It was always going to be difficult to escape from a first-innings score of 56 all out, and so it proved, with Dawson’s six for 61 ensuring Hampshire’s win by an innings. Northants have only secured one batting bonus point all season, but there was one bright spark in Saif Zaib, who finished unbeaten with 57, as well as being top scorer in the first-innings debacle. Five wickets for Craig Overton hurried Somerset over the line against Middlesex at Lord’s, only their second Championship win away from home in over two years. While at New Road, Adam Hose and Gareth Roderick hauled Worcestershire to a most unexpected three-wicket win over Leicestershire, after being bowled out for 83 in their first innings. Alastair Cook can sleep with dreams of a hundred, 87 not out at stumps, as he and Tom Westley soaked up the deficit for Essex against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. DIVISION ONE The Rose Bowl:Hampshire 367 BEAT Northamptonshire 56 and 176 Lord’s: Somerset 404 BEAT Middlesex 175 and 216 by an innings and 13 runs. Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 442 v Essex 298 and 199-1 The Oval: Surrey 362 and 58-0 BEAT Kent 278 and 141 by ten wickets. DIVISION TWO Bristol: Gloucestershire 292 and 181-6 v Durham 445 and 272-4dec Gloucs need 245 to win Hove: Sussex 481 v Glamorgan 123 and 499-5 New Road: Worcestershire 83 and 274-7 BEAT Leicestershire 173 and 180 by three wickets Good morning! After yesterday’s avalanche of results, just three games in play today: at Hove, Bristol and Trent Bridge. Worcestershire’s upside-down victory yesterday should give Glamorgan hopes of holding on against Sussex – especially if captain Carlson can stay in, while Gloucestershire look in big trouble and an intriguing match is unfolding in Nottingham. This is the last day of Championship cricket until June 11, so even if your team are already jubilant/despondent, do brew a coffee and come chew the fat BTL."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-to-meet-biden-at-g7-kyiv-says-fighting-in-bakhmut-continues","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T18:20:06Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy says Bakhmut ‘is not occupied’; Russia accuses G7 of ‘undermining global stability’ — as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-to-meet-biden-at-g7-kyiv-says-fighting-in-bakhmut-continues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-to-meet-biden-at-g7-kyiv-says-fighting-in-bakhmut-continues","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy says Bakhmut ‘is not occupied’; Russia accuses G7 of ‘undermining global stability’ — as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9.20pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news: Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the G7 summit in Japan as a “politicised” event which it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. The US president, Joe Biden, has announced a new package of military aid of up to $375m to Ukraine, telling its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the US is doing all it can to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” There has been some confusion over whether Russia has taken the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Vladimir Putin congratulated troops on its “liberation”. At the G7 meeting, Zelenskiy asserted that Bakhmut had not been captured by Russia and that Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but that he could not give clear information. He added that Bakhmut reminded him of pictures of a totally destroyed Hiroshima after the second world war. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said that Ukrainian forces had partly encircled Bakhmut along the flanks and still maintained control of a private sector in the city. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces said on Sunday he had visited frontline positions near the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, where he thanked troops defending the area. In a Telegram post, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi also said Ukrainian forces were continuing their advance along the flanks of the ruined city. In a press conference, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s peace formula offers a vision of a world of peace that will “paralyse other potential aggressors”. Zelenskiy added that as well as regaining the northern territories, it was imperative that Ukraine recaptured the southern and eastern regions currently occupied by Russia. Russia has announced indictments in absentia for a judge and prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) who issued a war crimes warrant for President Vladimir Putin. A statement from the national investigative committee said the judge, Rosario Salvatore Aitala, and the prosecutor, Khan Karim Asad Ahmad, are both charged with “preparing to attack a representative of a foreign country enjoying international protection in order to complicate international relations”. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has denied Russian claims the Kremlin has captured the key Donbas city of Bakhmut, saying Ukrainian forces still held positions in the city. “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today,” he told a press conference at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. The Wagner mercenary group claimed that Russia had seized the last urban areas in Bakhmut, in a video posted on Telegram. The contested city has been reduced to rubble in the longest battle of the conflict in Ukraine. A delegation of six African leaders set to hold talks with Kyiv and Moscow aim to “initiate a peace process,” but also broach the thorny issue of how a heavily sanctioned Russia can be paid for the fertiliser exports Africa desperately needs, according to a mediator who helped broker the talks, who made the comments in an interview with the Associated Press. Jean-Yves Ollivier, an international negotiator who has been working for six months to put the talks together, said the African leaders would also discuss the related issue of easing the passage of more grain shipments out of Ukraine amid the war and the possibility of more prisoner swaps when they travel to both countries on what they have characterised as a peace mission. The talks will probably be next month, Ollivier said. He arrived in Moscow on Sunday and will also go to Kyiv for meetings with high-level officials to work out “logistics” for the upcoming talks. For one, the six African presidents would probably have to travel to Kyiv by night train from Poland amid the fighting, he said. Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy have both agreed to separately host the delegation of presidents from South Africa, Senegal, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Zambia. The talks also have the approval of the US the EU, the United Nations, the African Union and China, Ollivier said in a video call with the AP on Friday. Russia has announced indictments in absentia for a judge and prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) who issued a war crimes warrant for President Vladimir Putin. A statement from the national investigative committee said the judge, Rosario Salvatore Aitala, and the prosecutor, Khan Karim Asad Ahmad, are both charged with “preparing to attack a representative of a foreign country enjoying international protection in order to complicate international relations”. They both also face other charges. Conviction could bring prison terms of up to 12 years, AP reported. The committee also said other ICC officials were being investigated. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces said on Sunday he had visited frontline positions near the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, where he thanked troops defending the area. In a Telegram post, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi also said Ukrainian forces were continuing their advance along the flanks of the ruined city. It’s been a busy day, with plenty of speeches from the G7 summit in Hiroshima and confusion over exactly what has happened in Bakhmut, after conflicting accounts from Russia and Ukraine. Here are all the key points: Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the G7 summit in Japan as a “politicised” event which it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. The US president, Joe Biden, has announced a new package of military aid of up to $375m to Ukraine, telling its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the US is doing all it can to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” There has been some confusion over whether Russia has taken the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Vladimir Putin congratulated troops on its “liberation”. At the G7 meeting, Zelenskiy asserted that Bakhmut had not been captured by Russia and that Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but that he could not give clear information. He added that Bakhmut reminded him of pictures of a totally destroyed Hiroshima after the second world war. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said that Ukrainian forces had partly encircled Bakhmut along the flanks and still maintained control of a private sector in the city. In a press conference, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s peace formula offers a vision of a world of peace that will “paralyse other potential aggressors”. Zelenskiy added that as well as regaining the northern territories, it was imperative that Ukraine recaptured the southern and eastern regions currently occupied by Russia. Thanks for following. I’m handing over to my colleague Tom Ambrose who’ll be keeping you updated for the rest of the day. Yoon Suk Yeol, the South Korean president, who met Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time on the sidelines of the G7, has said he is planning to provide Ukraine with mine-removing equipment and ambulances. Yoon added that South Korea would carefully review a list of some non-lethal weapons requested by Zelenskiy. South Korea signed an agreement with Ukraine on Wednesday on its plan to provide a $130m financial aid package, a day after the visiting first lady of the war-torn country asked for military assistance. South Korea, a leading producer of artillery shells, has said it was not providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, citing its relations with Russia. In Moldova, tens of thousands of people have gathered in the capital, Chișinău, to support their pro-western government’s drive towards Europe amid what officials have said are Russian efforts to destabilise their country. Reuters reports: Moldova has been badly hit by the impact of Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, which Chisinau has repeatedly condemned, and applied to join the European Union. President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of seeking to sabotage its European integration by fuelling anti-government protests and propaganda. Moscow denies meddling in Moldova’s affairs. At the rally organised by her government, Sandu pledged that Moldova would become an EU member by 2030, and said: Moldova does not want to be blackmailed by the Kremlin. We don’t want to be on the outskirts of Europe any more. Russia’s foreign ministry has dismissed the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, as a “politicised” event that it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. Reuters reports: Moscow lashed out after the leaders of the world’s richest democracies said they would not back down from supporting Ukraine, in a warning to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as he claimed to have taken the eastern city of Bakhmut, which Kyiv denied. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said the G7 had “irreversibly deteriorated” and that the forum had become “an ‘incubator’ where, under the leadership of the Anglo-Saxons, destructive initiatives that undermine global stability are prepared”. The statement accused the G7 of fanning anti-Russian and anti-Chinese “hysteria”. Russia used to be a member of the G7 club of industrialised democracies, which was previously known as the G8, until Moscow was excluded after its the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. The summit gave Zelenskiy a chance to lobby for support from other attendees, like the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who have remained uncommitted. The Russian foreign ministry, in the same statement, accused the G7 of “flirting” with non-western states in an effort to stymie the development of their ties with Moscow and Beijing. It said it was convinced though that the forum was incapable of reflecting the interests of the Asia-Pacific region, South Asia, the Middle East, Africa or Latin America. The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont has been looking into Russia’s claims that its troops have taken Bakhmut, which has been challenged by Ukraine. His full report is here: There’s more detail on Reuters on the police investigation in Germany into the possible poisoning of two Russian exiles who attended a conference in Berlin at the end of April, which was organised by Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Media reports said one of the women was a journalist and her symptoms may have already appeared before the conference on 29 and 30 April. She went to the Charité hospital in Berlin. The second woman was Natalia Arno, director of the NGO Free Russia Foundation. She wrote on her Facebook page that she found the door to her hotel room had been left ajar. She also wrote: “I woke up at 5am, suffering sharp pain and strange symptoms.” A top Ukrainian general has said that Kyiv’s forces controlled an “insignificant” part of the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that the foothold would be enough to enter the devastated city when the situation changed. In a Telegram post, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Kyiv’s forces were advancing on Russian forces in the suburbs of Bakhmut and that they were getting closer to a “tactical encirclement” of the city. Leaders of the world’s richest democracies said on Sunday they would not back down from supporting Ukraine, in a warning to Vladimir Putin as he claimed to have taken the eastern city of Bakhmut, something Kyiv denied. Here is a snapshot from the G7 via Reuters: Zelenskiy sought support for Kyiv’s “peace formula” to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, telling G7 leaders at the summit in Hiroshima it was “an obvious expression of rationality”. Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on the sidelines of the summit and said it was because of scheduling. Joe Biden announced a $375m package of military aid, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing all it could to strengthen Ukraine’s defence against Russia. Potential allied training programmes for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 warplanes were a message to Russia not to expect to succeed in its invasion of Ukraine even in a prolonged conflict, said Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supported the joint allied training programmes, senior US officials said, a significant endorsement as Kyiv seeks to boost its air power against Russia. The Hiroshima summit gave Zelenskiy a chance to win over countries from the global south such as Brazil and India in an attempt to broaden support for his country in its war against Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said G7 decisions at the summit were aimed at the “double containment” of Russia and China. Canada would support Ukraine for as long and as much as necessary in its conflict with Russia, including the training of Ukrainian soldiers and possibly pilots, said the country’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The UK published plans to ban imports of Russian diamonds, copper, aluminium and nickel and announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia, targeting companies connected to the alleged theft of Ukrainian grain. As part of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference at the G7, he told reporters that international law could not stand if Russia was able to keep occupied land in any ceasefire deal. He also said other international leaders could be tempted to “wage similar wars”. “If the level of evil and stupidity in Russia’s actions are left unchecked, the world will inevitably become a wreck,” he said. “It is only a matter of time before other criminals in public office want to wage similar wars. “If Russia is allowed to keep even a sliver of the territory it occupies, international law will never again apply.” Zelenskiy said he would like “all states that are capable” to supply weapons to Ukraine, though he said he understood there could be legislative or constitutional barriers. He added that he was grateful for western countries’ sanctions against Russia. Zelenskiy said he had secured high-quality weapons from everyone at the G7 summit. He said he was confident that Ukraine would receive F-16 fighter jets from the west, but was unsure how many. Dodging a question about when Ukraine’s counteroffensive would begin, he said: Russia will feel when we have a counteroffensive. Speaking at the G7 Summit, Joe Biden said he had received a “flat assurance” from Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden told reporters that F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Zelenskiy said the pictures of ruined Hiroshima “remind me of Bakhmut and other similar settlements and towns”. This is just a totally destroyed area, nothing left, not a single person left. Today it’s a tragedy but in the future there will be reconstruction and recovery. Zelenskiy said there was no evidence that Brazil, China and India were sending weapons to Russia. He added that it was important to “be united together” to involve everyone in the peace formula. He said he had met almost all the G7 leaders, but there was a scheduling reason for not meeting the Brazilian president. Zelenskiy said he was grateful to the US and other western leaders for their support with air defence systems. We have several months for the training of our pilots and we’ll be working for these people to be as trained and experienced as possible. I cannot tell you how many aircrafts we will be able to get or when it will take place but we will speed it up because it’s important for us. Answering questions from journalists, Zelenskiy asserted that Bakhmut had not been captured by Russia and that Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but that he could not give clear information. He said: We are fighting thanks to the courage of our people, our warriors. I clearly understand what has taken place in Bakhmut. I cannot share with you the tactical views of our military. Bakhmut is not occupied by Russia Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of those words. Zelenskiy said it is only a matter of time before other “criminals in public office” want to emulate Russia’s example. This is why the peace formula is important, he said. The power of the Ukrainian peace formula is by stopping Russia’s ambitions we will give the world one additional result, we will paralyse other potential aggressors. When everyone who wants war sees how united and determined the world is when it wants peace there will be no point. Ukraine offers the world salvation from war. To do this we need to unite and make Russia the last aggressor. Zelenskiy said he dreams of rebuilding “all our cities that are in ruins” similar to Hiroshima’s regeneration. We dream of returning our territories just as we have regained our northern territories that were occupied by Russia, we must regain our eastern and southern territories. We dream of returning our people now in Russian captivity. We dream of peace after our victory. I am here in Hiroshima so the world can hear the Ukrainian call for unity. Russia has trampled on everything that is civilised. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is speaking now at the G7 summit. He said: Our heroic people are turning history around so we can make war itself become a shadow. I believe that war has no place in the world. Humanity has come a very long way and lost many lives in bloody confrontations, death. Ukraine is in the middle of a war of destruction. Invaders have come to our land. Biden has said that US-Japan relations have never been stronger, adding that “what’s happening in Ukraine affects everyone, even here in the Pacific basin”. In his G7 speech, the US president has pledged “our shared and unwavering commitment to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against this brutal war of aggression and war crimes being committed”. He said: Russia started this war and Russia can end it today by withdrawing its troops from internationally recognised borders. This morning I once more shared and assured President Zelenskiy … that we will not waver. Putin will not break our resolve, as he thought he could two years ago, almost three years ago. Here’s a summary of the last few hours in Ukraine and at the G7 summit in Tokyo: US President Joe Biden has announced a new package of military aid of up to $375m to Ukraine, telling President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the US is doing all it can to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would not use Western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. He said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area.” In a G7 speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” There has been some confusion over whether Russia has taken the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Vladimir Putin congratulated troops on its “liberation”. At the G7 meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asserted that Bakhmut had not been captured by Russia and that Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but that he could not give clear information. He added that Bakhmut reminded him of pictures of a totally destroyed Hiroshima after WWII. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said that Ukrainian forces had partly encircled the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut along the flanks and still maintained control of a private sector in the city. In a press conference, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s Peace Formula offers a vision of a world of peace, that will “paralyse other potential aggressors”. Zelenskiy added that as well as regaining the northern territories, it was imperative that Ukraine recaptured the southern and eastern regions currently occupied by Russia. German police said they were investigating the possible poisoning of two Russian exiles who attended a conference in Berlin at the end of April, organised by Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Berlin police told Reuters “a file had been opened” after German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, citing Russian investigative media group Agentstvo, said two women reported symptoms that suggested possible poisoning. Police gave no further details. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has laid flowers at a cenotaph in Hiroshima honouring those who died after the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945. Accompanied by the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, Zelenskiy earlier visited the Peace Memorial Museum, where exhibits show the full horror of the attack, in which an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people died instantly, with the death toll rising to 140,000 by the end of the year as more succumbed to burns and illnesses caused by exposure to radiation. The names of more than 300,000 people whose deaths during the past 78 years have been attributed to the bombing are listed at the cenotaph, whose inscription reads: “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.” After laying bouquets on podiums, Kishida and Zelenskiy lowered their heads and posed for a photograph before listening to an explanation of the memorial from the mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui. Ukrainian forces have partly encircled the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut along the flanks and still maintain control of a private sector in the city, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said. She made the remarks on the Telegram messaging app shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the battle had ended with a Russian victory. Maliar said Ukrainian troops are continuing their advances along Bakhmut’s outskirts and have claimed part of the heights overlooking the city. She wrote: Our forces have taken the city in a semi-encirclement, which gives us the opportunity to destroy the enemy. Therefore, the enemy has to defend himself in the part of the city he controls. Maliar added that Ukrainian troops are still defending industrial and infrastructure facilities in Bakhmut. Russia’s top lawmaker has called for a ban on Polish trucks transiting Russian territory and for Poland to compensate Moscow financially for what he said was the Soviet rebuilding of the east European country after the second world war. In a statement, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said Poland needed to be punished for having “betrayed the historical memory” of the Soviet Union’s liberation of the country from Nazi Germany with a series of hostile acts against Moscow. In comments certain to deepen a feud with Warsaw, Volodin said Poland existed as a state only “thanks to our country”, said Warsaw should pay Russia more than $750bn to compensate it for Soviet investment in the country after 1945. He said Poland should also hand back territory it received after the war. There was no immediate reaction to his comments from Warsaw. Volodin said a parliamentary committee would begin considering a ban on Polish trucks entering Russian territory as soon as Monday. Such a move, he said, would cause Poland significant financial pain and job losses. Russia last month promised it would respond harshly to what it said was Poland’s illegal seizure of its embassy school in Warsaw, an act it called a flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. Reuters has posted a useful summary of the key Ukraine-related developments from the G7: Volodymyr Zelenskiy sought support for Kyiv’s “peace formula” to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, telling G7 leaders at the summit in the Japanese city of Hiroshima it was “an obvious expression of rationality”. Meeting with Zelenskiy, US President Joe Biden announced a $375m package of military aid to Ukraine, telling him the US was doing all it could to strengthen Ukraine’s defence against Russia. Potential allied training programmes for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 warplanes were a message to Russia not to expect to succeed in its invasion of Ukraine even in a prolonged conflict, said the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports the joint allied training programmes, senior US officials said, a significant endorsement as Kyiv seeks to boost its air power against Russia. The Hiroshima summit gave Zelenskiy a chance to win over countries from the “global south” such as Brazil and India in an attempt to broaden support for his country in its war against Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said G7 decisions at the summit were aimed at the “double containment” of Russia and China. Canada will support Ukraine for as long and as much as necessary in its conflict with Russia, including the training of Ukrainian soldiers and possibly pilots, said the prime minister Justin Trudeau. Britain published plans to ban imports of Russian diamonds, copper, aluminium and nickel and announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia, targeting companies connected to the alleged theft of Ukrainian grain. Zelenskiy arrived on a French government-labelled military aircraft for the G7 summit in Hiroshima, after addressing an Arab League summit, marked an achievement for the French president, Emmanuel Macron. A Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region said that Kyiv had struck the Russian-held port city of Berdyansk with British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles, Reuters reports. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Rogov said that seven missiles had been fired at the city, four of which were Storm Shadow missiles. He said six of the missiles had been intercepted and one had fallen on the edge of the city but had not caused any casualties. Reuters could not independently verify his assertion. The founder of Georgia’s national airline Georgian Airways has banned the country’s president from using its services after she said she would boycott the airline over its resumption of flights to Russia, Russia’s TASS news agency reports. Russia announced this month it was lifting a four-year old ban on direct flights with Georgia and removing a decades-old visa requirement for Georgians travelling to Russia. President Salome Zourabichvili urged Georgian authorities to thwart the Russian initiative, which they ignored. Tamaz Gaiashvili, founder of privately-owned Georgian Airways, was cited by TASS on Sunday as saying that Zourabichvili was now “persona non grata” and would be banned until she “apologises before the Georgian people”. There was no immediate reaction from Zourabichvili. Although Georgian officials welcomed the resumption of flights, some Georgians who want the South Caucasus country to distance itself from Moscow in favour of the European Union demonstrated against it in central Tbilisi on Sunday. Many Georgians oppose any rapprochement with Moscow whose troops garrison two breakaway regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - that make up around one fifth of the country’s territory. Other Georgians are more open to the idea however, and the Georgian government has in recent years worked to improve ties with Moscow, declining to impose sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine. President Zourabichvili, whose position is largely ceremonial and whose relations with the government are strained, has warned that deepening ties with Russia could jeopardise the country’s chances of the EU one day. The Guardian’s Justin McCurry has the full report on everything that’s happened at the G7 today, including the US military aid pledge and Zelenskiy’s speech: US President Joe Biden has announced a new package of military aid of up to $375m to Ukraine, telling President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the US was doing all it could to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. Biden, meeting with the Ukrainian leader on the sidelines of the G7 summit of world leaders in Japan, said the military aid package included ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. He said: Together with the entire G7, we have Ukraine’s back and I promise we’re not going anywhere. In the meeting, Biden stressed his country’s readiness to help build Ukraine’s long-term capacity to defend against and deter Russian aggression and US support for a joint effort with allied and partner nations to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth-generation fighter aircraft such as the F-16, the White House said. Zelenskiy thanked the US for the new package, and for the financial assistance of $37 billion to date, his office said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told G7 leaders in an address on Sunday that Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine is “an obvious expression of rationality”. Zelenskiy, who is attending the G7 summit in Japan in person, has in recent months been seeking global support for a “peace formula”. Thanking western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, he said: The more we all work together, the less likely anyone else in the world will follow Russia’s insane path But is this enough? He added that he planned to spend his day at the G7 discussing the Ukrainian Peace Formula. We’re united by one more principle - rationality. We always act practically protecting our values. And the Ukrainian Peace Formula is an obvious expression of rationality. I thank you for supporting our Formula. Zelenskiy has pushed Western allies and other countries to go further on both economic and military measures to support Kyiv as Russia’s 15-month invasion drags on. Russian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated the Wagner mercenary force and the Russian army for what he called the “liberation” of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which Russia calls by its Soviet-era name of Artyomovsk. In a statement published on the Kremlin website, Putin said that the battle - the longest and bloodiest of the 15-month war - had ended in a Russian victory: The head of state congratulated Wagner’s assault groups, as well as all members of the units of the Russian Armed Forces who provided them with the necessary support and cover on their flanks, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artyomovsk (Bakhmut). All those who distinguished themselves will be presented with state awards. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not confirm the capture by Russian forces of the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, his spokesman said on Sunday challenging earlier reports. Sergii Nykyforov wrote on Facebook suggesting that Zelenskiy’s comments have been misinterpreted: Reporter’s question: Russians said they have taken Bakhmut. President’s reply: I think no. In this way, the president denied the capture of Bakhmut. German police have opened an investigation after a Russian journalist and an activist who participated in a Berlin conference reported health problems that suggested possible poisoning, Agence France-Presse is reporting, citing the newspaper Welt am Sonntag. “A file has been opened based on the information available,” a Berlin police spokesperson told the Sunday weekly. Berlin police were not immediately available to respond, according to AFP. The Russian investigative media outlet Agentstvo published an investigation this week reporting on the health problems encountered by two participants at a meeting of Russian dissidents on 29 April and 30 organised by exiled former oligarch turned Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. One participant, identified as a journalist who had recently left Russia, experienced unspecified symptoms during the event and said they may have started earlier. The report added that the journalist went to the Charite University hospital in Berlin where Putin critic Alexei Navalny was treated after being poisoned in August 2020. Reuters is reporting Volodymyr Zelenskiy appeared to confirm the loss of the city of Bakhmut to Russia on Sunday, saying “I think no” when asked if it remained in Kyiv’s control. “I think no,” he said ahead of a meeting with Joe Biden at the G7 summit, according to Reuters. “For today, it is only in our hearts.” Among those not able to verify Wagner’s claim of victory in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, is US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. In its regular update, not only does it say, “ISW has not observed geolocated footage confirming Prigozhin’s claims as of this publication”, but it also goes on to assess if it really tactically matters anyway. “Prigozhin’s claimed victory over the remaining areas in Bakhmut is purely symbolic even if true. The last few urban blocks of eastern Bakhmut that Prigozhin claimed that Wagner Group forces captured are not tactically or operationally significant,” it says. “Their capture does not grant Russian forces operationally significant terrain to continue conducting offensive operations or any particularly strong position from which to defend against possible Ukrainian counterattacks.” Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. I’m Christine Kearney and here’s a run through of the latest developments. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is attempting to win support from the wider international community during a furious round of diplomacy on the final day of the G7 summit in Hiroshima. He is due to meet US president Joe Biden for a bilateral meeting on Sunday afternoon amid speculation that Washington could announce a new weapons package for Ukraine. French president Emmanuel Macron said the G7 summit in Japan was an opportunity to convince big emerging states such as India and Brazil regarding Ukraine. Macron said Zelenskiy’s surprise visit was a “game changer”. The Ukrainian president is due to speak at 7.15 pm (1015 GMT) on Sunday. Meanwhile, Kyiv has denied a claim by the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, that the Russian mercenary group has full control of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Neither statement can be independently verified. More on the G7 and other stories shortly. In other news: Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin made the Bakhmut victory claim in a video in which he appeared in combat fatigues in front of a line of fighters holding Russian flags and Wagner banners. “Today, at 12 noon, Bakhmut was completely taken,” Prigozhin said. He said that his forces would withdraw from Bakhmut from 25 May for rest and retraining. The Russian defence ministry also said the capture of Bakhmut had been ‘completed’ and president Vladimir Putin congratulated troops. He said those who had distinguished themselves would be given awards, domestic Russian news agencies reported. Speaking before the Russian ministry’s statement, Ukraine’s military rejected Prigozhin’s claim and said its troops were continuing to fight in the ruined eastern city. “This is not true. Our units are fighting in Bakhmut,” military spokesperson Serhiy Cherevatyi told Reuters. In its daily update early Sunday, the military also said: ‘Fighting for the city of Bakhmut does not stop.” Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said the situation in Bakhmut was critical, with Ukrainian troops maintaining a defence in the south-western part of the city. “Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical,” she said on the Telegram messaging app. “As of now, our defenders control some industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area and the private sector.” The G7 has condemned Russia’s “brutal” war on its neighbour Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, calling it a “serious violation of international law”, in its final communique from this week’s summit in Japan. The world leaders called for “just and lasting peace” and recommitted their intention to provide Ukraine with military, financial and humanitarian support. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had invited India to join Ukraine’s peace formula during his talks with the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the summit. Zelenskiy said on Telegram that they also discussed Ukraine’s needs in de-mining and mobile hospitals during their first face-to-face meeting since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Reuters reported. The US president, Joe Biden, will announce a $375m military aid package for Ukraine while in Japan, a US official has said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that the package would include artillery, ammunition and Himars rocket launchers, Reuters reported. Western countries will be running “colossal risks” if they supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, as saying on Saturday. Biden has told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programmes for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighters, senior US officials said. Pope Francis has tasked a leading Italian cardinal with a mission in hopes it can “ease tensions” in the Ukraine war and lead to a path of peace, the Vatican said Saturday. In a brief written statement, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that Francis had entrusted the mission to Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, who is close to the pontiff. The Associated Press reports that Bruni said the timetable and the mechanics of the mission “are currently under study.” The international criminal court said on Saturday that it was “undeterred” after Russia put prosecutor Karim Khan on a wanted list over his issuance of an arrest warrant for president Vladimir Putin. Khan, who is British, issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March on the war crime accusation of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. Khan’s picture could be seen in the Russian interior ministry’s database on Friday. An aide to the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, has said the object that entered Poland’s airspace last year and was found in April was a Russian-made rocket. Associated Press reports that the aide, Paweł Szrot, said on Radio RMF FM on Friday that the nose of the rocket had been found and that it was “peculiar” because it was made of concrete. It was being examined by experts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/21/firebrand-review-jude-laws-obese-and-oozy-henry-viii-rules-supreme-in-catherine-parr-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T18:08:20Z","webTitle":"Firebrand review – Jude Law’s obese and oozy Henry VIII rules supreme in Catherine Parr drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/firebrand-review-jude-laws-obese-and-oozy-henry-viii-rules-supreme-in-catherine-parr-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/21/firebrand-review-jude-laws-obese-and-oozy-henry-viii-rules-supreme-in-catherine-parr-drama","fields":{"headline":"Firebrand review – Jude Law’s obese and oozy Henry VIII rules supreme in Catherine Parr drama","bodyText":"Jude Law outrageously steals every scene as a horrendously unwell and cross Henry VIII in this Tudor court intrigue drama that also serves as an amusing noir counterfactual, adapted by the screenwriters Jessica and Henrietta Ashworth from the novel by Elizabeth Fremantle and directed by the Brazilian film-maker Karim Aïnouz, making his English-language feature debut. It’s all about the king’s tense relationship with his sixth and final queen, Catherine Parr, played with creamy, inscrutable placidity by Alicia Vikander. The king’s bedchamber is perfumed by the pus splurging from Henry’s bloated and ulcerated legs as the doctor changes his bandages, getting thumped and screamed at by the royal patient. This Henry is peevish and cantankerous. And we at one stage get a full-on shot of His Majesty’s pale, fleshy bum as he has conjugal relations with Catherine – like the giant, shaved arse of a sheep. Did Law use a buttock double for this stomach-turning image? But there is something deeply disturbing and abusive about Henry’s violent behaviour: misogyny and coercive control we might call it now, and Henry didn’t have to remind his wives that the scaffold awaited them. Aïnouz interestingly conveys the purely dysfunctional and Dionysiac strangeness of Henry’s court, upon which he still hopes to impose his will through displays of music, dancing and his own jadedly roistering good humour, but also capriciously changing his mood to keep these timeservers on their toes. He is of course aware that all his marriages have been political alliances with potential or actual enemies, so his marital relations are poisoned with paranoia from the outset. Catherine Parr is reasonably in favour with him, having been appointed regent while the king was in France, but widely suspected of religious radical sympathies in objecting to church use of elitist Latin: the movie imagines a friendship between Catherine and the Protestant heretic preacher and firebrand Anne Askew (Erin Doherty) and is she thus hated by the reactionary bishop Stephen Gardiner (Simon Russell Beale), who would love to burn her at the stake. Meanwhile, the Seymour family, connected with the king’s surviving male heir, Edward, son of the late Jane Seymour and destined to die as Edward VI at just 15 years old, are coolly circling and Thomas and Edward Seymour (Sam Riley and Eddie Marsan) are smugly aware of their own privilege. But just as Catherine’s star begins to wane, she gets pregnant – a wildly thrilled Henry declares it is probably a boy. But will she survive? This movie gets a voltage charge every time Law comes on in all his finery: roaring, smirking, wincing, pining and yearning to be loved. But, frankly, Aïnouz has not directed Vikander very interestingly and allows her to be upstaged. Her sphinx-like self-possession makes political sense of course, Catherine has secrets to keep and, like many women at court, she knows that a kind of blankness or invisibility is necessary for survival. But there is a key moment in which Catherine angrily attacks Henry for his oppression of Askew and then tremblingly asks for his forgiveness: Vikander should have been at full throttle for that scene, but her line readings feel underpowered; we will later learn what her character is capable of, but the film doesn’t give her a chance to really show that ruthlessness through her performance. Like many movies about Henry, the future reign of Elizabeth is gestured at as the female power that gives the current action a kind of progressive meaning. Elizabeth is the film’s voiceover narrator and the final title cards even claim of her: “Neither men nor war ever defined her reign.” Erm … this is Elizabeth I we’re talking about, is it? It’s a watchable piece of faux history, but the movie does not know what to do with its own heroine, content to leave her to the clutches of its villain: Henry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2023/may/21/manchester-city-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T18:02:50Z","webTitle":"Manchester City lift Premier League trophy after win over Chelsea – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/may/21/manchester-city-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2023/may/21/manchester-city-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City lift Premier League trophy after win over Chelsea – as it happened","bodyText":"And that is us. Thanks all for your company and comments – stick with us for what is guaranteed to be a ridiculous end to another ridiculous season. Peace. Good news from elsewhere… De Bruyne tells Sky how hard it is to keep going, mentally as much as physically, and also notes how many others sacrifice for them. “This is my home,” he says of City, thanking the fans for their support, and Geoff Shreeves is desperate to force him into hyperbole but he’s having no such thing. The WSL title is almost Chelsea’s but Man United are keeping them honest, leading City 1-0. Also going on: Here’s David Hytner’s match report. “Surreal,” says Stones, who never thought he’d win five titles; who knows how many he’ll finish with. Asked if he’s in the form of his life, he says he doesn’t like to talk about himself, but when he was out of the team, he was always trying to find consistency and now thinks he has. On his new position, he says a natural and experienced centre-mid knows what’s behind them but he’s learning that, is enjoying it. And he’s got a new appreciation of playing centre-back and when to pass a midfielder the ball – Guardiola has taught him a lot about body-shape, simplifying what’s required. The aim now is to win the other two pots. “Unreal,” is Haaland’s summation. “Listen to this song and enjoy,” he says as the crowd serenade him and he lopes off to milk the adulation. He returns, though, saying he’ll remember this for the rest of his life, noting that things could’ve gone better, but 36 goals isn’t a bad start. Grealish feels more a part of it, “back to my normal self.” He enjoyed it last term because it was his first but this time he’s given it his best and he feels so much fitter and more confident now. He’s showing why City bought him but still has lots more to give, he reckons. He can’t put his finger on what changed, but since the international break they’ve taken it up a level and reckons the month of April is the best any City side has ever produced. Asked about his relationship with Haaland, he says they live in the same building so come to training together a fair bit, and their friendship off the pitch manifests on it. Ah, and here is Haaland; “I fucking love you!” Grealish tells him and of course Sky apologise; feel free to form your own lists of things they think are fine. The players begin their lap of honour, Hey Jude on the PA. Haaland rushes an end behind the goal, lifting the trophy and receiving cheers. Manchester City are champions again! Ah, the players all have “CHAMPIONS 23” on the backs of their shirts. Clever clever. One by one the players collect their medals and ascend the dais. What a player Bernardo Silva is – and yet, a player who’d be nowhere near as good playing for any other manager. “If you ever drank in the Con in 90s Camden,” returns John, “I probably served you. I had no problem serving (drinks) to pupils in uniform from Camden School for Girls. No chauvinism in our pub.” Ha! We tended to go to Quinns – three Aventinus then back to school was a challenge, I can tell you. Guardiola takes his medal and now has 11 titles in 14 years of management. Biggup Mourinho, Conte and Klopp, the only men who’ve bested him over a season. Now here come the players. Jack Grealish looks the happiest, and well in the mood for an evening. Here comes Pep Guardiola, kit over top and high-fiving the line of staff. He is remarkably, uncannily brilliant at extracting the most from elite talents while pushing the game on. Here comes the trophy, and here comes Alex Williams – Panini veterans will remember him – who for just a little longer works for City in the community. “I’m Camden Town born and bred, says David Johnson. “Everything south of the water is Surrey, Hampshire or, what’s that other one? Sussex? They only attach London to the description to push up house prices. It’s like when estate agents call Archway ‘South Highgate’ or Acton ‘West Kensington’.” I went to school in Camden, and in the 90s it felt like the absolute epicentre of London. Where else could you get a lunchtime pint, in school uniform (me, not the pint). In the studio, they’re talking about where City rank among the best sides we’ve ever seen. Given any conversation of that sort has to start with who won what, I’d say they’re up there in terms of the league, a treble and they’re up there with the best english sides overall. That said, until very recently, I’d always thought these were less good than the Silva/Aguero/Kompany side, but I’d rank both miles above Arsenal 04, who I also think were less good than Mourinho’s Chelsea. The subs didn’t make enough impact, says Allardyce; he’s less loquacious about the caretaker manager. Is there any way whatsoever that this time next season, City aren’t celebrating four in a row? What’s unusual about them is that they’re still improving – the other teams to do three straight, Man United 99-01 and 07-09, were on the way down at this point. They still got close, but the challengers were likely better than those City will face next term, so it’s pretty hard to see a different outcome. “Since when have Arsenal and Spurs defined the geography of London!” wonders Richard Hirst. “South London rules; remember, Balham is the gateway to the South.” I’m just saying it seems strange if Arsenal v AFC Wimbledon is a derby but Arsenal v Watford is not. Sky are showing a City highlights package, and I’m wondering if their 3-3 draw at Newcastle is the best game I’ve seen this season. The pitch has been largely cleared now, or at least those left on it are behind the line of stewarts stewards, so the trophy should soon be with us. The Premier League title is decided, but the WSL pot remains in the balance, just. And what a match we’ve got for you now… “I imagine how United and Inter beat City would be very much getting a stomp on from the get go,” reckons Bill Preston. “Nick a lead, then thrilling defensive heroics. Three points make a triangle and everything comes from there.” Thing is, City just start games so well – Madrid weren’t allowed so much as a breath in the first 20 minutes. Walker also praises the quality, camaraderie and mentality in the squad, while Phillips is hoping to play in the remaining games but if not he’s there to “support the lads” and is “praying to God” that Leeds stay up. Back to Phillips, he says that City can win the Champions League theuy’ll be cemented as one of the greatest temas ever, and he’s right. Walker says the “lads did tremendous today”, praising their ability to stay focus. In particular, he’s happy with how Phillips did, and Phillips is happy to have won the league and to have played. Confidence-wise, he’s had the lowest moments of his career this season, and leaders like Walker have kept him going. Walker then says that Phillips is “a gem, one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met in football”, and that it’s hard playing for “the manager” so a bit of time to settle is to be expected. He then references the win over Liverpool just after the World Cup as when he thought they could win the title again, they beat Leeds in the next game, and now they want to win the lot. “This season of football ended on the day when bright minds in Bavaria gave Nagelsmann the boot,” reckons Yash Gupta. “As good as City have been and they would still be favourites as Pep has a better team than Bayern, that match could’ve been a blockbuster. Nagelsmann looked like he learnt from his mistakes this season. Needless to say I enjoyed Bayern demolition.” I’m not sure about that – Nagelsmann’s Bayern looked a mess to me. Kyle Walker takes a seat on the City bench; he’s earned it. City finish their home programme with a win – they lead Arsenal by seven with two games left to their one – there’s a pitch invasion, some blue flares, and the players are escorted off the pitch. 90+2 min Of course, it’s not as simple as that – under pressure, perhaps City don’t keep winning – except we’ve seen them do it before. 90+1 min There’s a buzz in the crowd as throats are warmed for the final whistle. I should say that if Arsenal had beaten Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton, City would still be a point above them. 90 min There’ll be three added minutes. 90 min Chukwuemeka wins the ball in midfield and finds Mudryk, whose shot definitely doesn’t go in because I can see the score remains 1-0, but I’m not sure what happened to it as my SkyGo crashed. 88 min Gary Neville gives player of the match to Foden; I’d’ve gone Alvarez, but it’s been nice to see the former screeching through the middle and prompting on the half-turn. It’ll be fascinating to see if he wins his first-XI spot back next season. Oh, and Chelsea brought on Pulisic for Havertz. 86 min I don’t feel we’ve settled the how do United and Inter beat City question. 86 min There’s not loads going on on the pitch, City sweeping forward and Alvarez curling over the top from 20 yards. 85 min “It’s 11 miles from Selhurst Park to Arsenal’s ground, and 14 miles from Vicarage Road to Arsenal’s ground,” tweets Kieran Toms, and fair play, I didn’t check because I was so certain it was nearer it didn’t seem necessary. That’s what traffic does to you. 84 min “I am old so I understand the preference for Billy Bragg v rap protest music,” writes Mary Waltz. “But I would remind some of my older citizens that the ‘he isn’t singing he is croaking’ was the exact arguments made against Bob Dylan when he went electric. If the rap style turns you off try reading the lyrics first and think of it as musical spoken poetry. I am not saying I am a hip-hop aficionado but an open mind will occasionally expose oneself to some gems.” Absolutely. As I’m constantly reminding my niece, nephew and daughter, be open not closed. 82 min Trevor off Eastenders Paul Dickov is at the game in a City kit. He’s 50. 81 min I keep forgetting who’s in this Chelsea squad, and on comes Koulibaly – today, it’s him – for Hall, with Chukwuemeka replacing Loftus-Cheek – and also him. 80 min “I’m not a Chelsea supporter,” brags Alexandra Ashton, “but from what I’ve seen of Fernandez during the World Cup and in these recent months, he seems like a skilled young player with potential, not a generational talent with the world at his fingertips. Benfica signed him for €10M from River and I think his value, although having increased, is most certainly not close to €120M. €50M would be my value as of after the World Cup, maybe 60. Maybe in five years Chelsea will have won the league three times with him as a central figure and we’ll be saying he was worth the price, but I doubt it.” What I like about him is that he’s good at defeating the press with a good range of passing, but as you say, for the money you’d expect more. 79 min He giveth and he taketh away. 78 min Two more changes for City, the big guns sent on to enjoy the final-whistle celebrations. De Bruyne and Rodri on, Gomez and Laporte off. 76 min “Ah come on now,” says Pedro Da Feu. “While I spent a large portion of my life very annoyed at my commute having to get a train from central London to Croydon for work every day, and passing their stadium, I can at least acknowledge that Crystal Palace is a London club, while Watford definitely is not.” I was messing, but Watford is a lot nearer Arsenal and Spurs than Palace and Charlton are. 74 min Alvarez carries forward before slipping a ball in behind to meet Haaland’s diagonal run. But taking possession down the left of the box, he can only skew an attempted shot wide of the far post. 74 min Change for city, Haaland for Mahrez. I’m not sure how Mahrez avoids a booking for that, because it was so obviously snide and deliberate, but he does. …Mahrez crouched to try and hide it, but he definitely used an arm to nudge the ball away and into his path as Hall slipped. This’ll be disallowed. Here they come again, Mahrez getting away from Hall, who slips, crossing low, and Alvarez – what a signing he’s been! – tapping in. 70 min “For all your, I’m sure justified, dissing of Chelsea,” says Richard Hirst, “they’ve had four shots on target to City’s one. Funny game, football.” Yup. I guess part of playing well is taking chances, though, and Chelsea have a real lack of conviction in everything they do. 69 min Double change for Chelsea: Mudryk and Madueke for Gallagher and Sterling. 69 min A ball over the top sees Alvarez worrying Fofana, and a quick shove sends him over – more easily than you’d like. So Alvarez squares, Mahrez taps home, and the flag goes up for the foul. 67 min On Fernandez, how do we think he’s doing? I wasn’t that impressed during the World Cup – he played fairly well, but nothing that made me think he was worth whatever the price was. I’m sure processing his achievement while emigrating to a country with different language and culture was tricky, all the more so given the mess he walked into. But I’m still not seeing a generational talent, though those who’ve watched him loads, much more than I have, think to the contrary. 66 min Fernandez kicks the ball away and is booked. 65 min Fernandez clips over the top for Sterling, loitering in the middle, and have a look! You do not see that often, and by “that” I mean Walker diddled. But diddled he is, Sterling going inside then out, shooting low, and though Ortega gets a touch, the ball trickles golawards … except Stones humps off the line, just before the flag goes up anyway. 63 min “Your reference to the Romanian national team players bleaching their hair brings back some vivid memories not from USA ‘94 but France ‘98,” chides Fifi Bartels. This what happens when you get old, all the years merge into one. 61 min “I suspect you’re right about Foden,” emails Josh Wilson, “however he may have to move into the centre to take Bernardo’s minutes next season. In that case, we’d be looking for a winger to play both sides and a left-back. As for replacing Dias - haven’t you watched him this season? Best centre-back in the league by a mile.” Yeah, when things weren’t going so well for City, I was shocked to see a Guardiola side with Mahrez and Grealish out wide as neither has much pace. Now, though, not so much, and though I think Dias is a good player, I don’t think he’s as good as Martínez, Saliba or Varane off the top of my head. His leadership and bloody-mindedness make a massive difference to this side though because those are qualities it’s lacked in the past. 60 min Sterling is trying his best and he roadrunners through the middle, finding Hall outside him, but the resultant shot is pushed away by Ortega easily enough. 58 min Mahrez swerves in flat and fast, Phillips is up … and he nods against the near post! He’s putting himself about here. 58 min On which point, how crazy is it that Stones is suddenly fulfilling his potential now that he’s not longer playing in position? Anyway, free-kick City out on the left, Mahrez to take… 57 min Change for City: Akanji off, Stones on. 55 min On which point, you wonder what kind of lift they’ll need to get them going again next season. I guess the most obvious comparator is Man United, who were appalling under Ralf Rangnick at the end of last season – though not this appalling, which seems a mad thing to say having lived through that period because how could anything be worse? But Chelsea are, and unlike United have a bunch of players who are new together rather than a squad that’d finished second twice. On the other hand, I daresay Mauricio Pochettino will quite like the squad he’s been bequeathed, and he definitely has the personality and smarts to inspire them to better. 54 min Chelsea knock the ball about without intention or intensity. 52 min “Your opening thoughts about the financial backing for City can’t be ignored, reckons Mary Waltz. “It reminds me of the Faustian bargain we make. My love of sport borders on the juvenile occasionally and ignoring my conscious to continue my passion for it is sometimes required. Sometimes we as a collective say Enough!, as the fans in the UK did with the craven attempt of the owners to set up the super league. Nine years ago the NFL went too far and I abandoned 40 yeas of fandom and boycotted them but I substituted the PL and I am faced with similar compromises with a different accent.” Yup – sport’s problem is that it’s just too good: too good to avoid people whose interest is in using it for their own selfish ends. As supporters, we shouldn’t have to debate whether we can enjoy or continue watching our team because we also care about human rights, but the avarice and myopia of authorities and governments means we are where we are. 51 min Sterling carries forward and finds Hall to his left; Hall takes a decent first touch that carries him inside, across the face of the box, before shooting low, hard and too close to Ortega. 50 min Alvarez into Lewis into Foden, who shoots from edge … but Thaigo Silva blocks at source. 49 min Loftus-Cheek carries forward and finds Gallagher, who passes behind Havertz. It’s a serious effort for players this talented to be this dreadful – in some ways, it’s admirable. 47 min “Further to Richard Hirst’s message,” says Liam Curson, “with us playing Forest at home next week, there’s a glorious opportunity for Palace to finish above Chelsea too. Hell, I wouldn’t even put it past Chelsea to concede another four here, lose to Newcastle, and West Ham to overtake them on the final day … when were Chelsea last bottom of the PL London clubs?” Good question. Even the last time they went down, 1987-88, Watford were below them, and if Palace count as a London club, they surely do too? I’m not sure whether or not I’m joking there. 46 min “There is only one Bard of Barking, Daniel,” tweets @Grog_Eisenbein, '“and he’s the singing kind.” Why do we need to choose when we can have both? Seriously, check out that record and come back to me. 46 min We go again… Back come the teams… Elsewhere, Brighton guaranteed themselves European football with a 3-1 win over Southampton; they need one more point to make it Europa, not conference. What an absurd impact Robert Di Zerbi has had, and what great work by Tony Bloom and chums in appointing him. “Your comment at 45 mins about Chelsea having the ‘how to play football’ bit of their brains removed,” says Simon Mazoer. “A Lampotomy?” Arf! Sadly, though the malaise predates him; a toddsplant, maybe? Half-time email: “Phil Foden receiving five winners medals before the average person passes their driving test is cause for a celebration of achievement,” says William Preston. “He’s phenomenally gifted and also managed to absolutely rock a peroxide blonde barnet which when I tried it ended up looking like a 1970s pub ceiling. Actually, yeah, five medals at the age of 22?! Stop this bus, and hold them in trust for a few years for ‘the good of the nation’.” Nothing will ever beat Romania at USA ’94, but I’ve not seen anyone wear the do less well than Alejandro Garnacho. Half-time entertainment: Potter Payper’s new album is the realest talk I’ve heard in a long, long time. Rap storytelling at its finest, but be prepared for it to finish you. City are good, Chelsea are not. Stick with us for further insights. 45+2 min Chelsea win a free-kick just outside the box, right of centre, and Havertz curls into the wall, a header sending the ball behind it, and Lewis does really well to cover, taking away from Gallagher. 45+1 min Funny thing really, not long ago it looked like everything would be up for grabs on the final day, now it looks like we’ll have Leeds needing a miracle to stay up and nothing else. 45 min We’ll have one added minute. 45 min Chelsea look like they’ve had the how to play football bit of their brains removed. 43 min Laporte punches down the left to Alvarez but, with little on, he plays backwards and Lewis moves the ball on one more for Phillips to swipe a vicious shot just wide. He’s playing pretty well here. 41 min So how do City improve this summer? A replacement for Gundogan, maybe? A specialist left-back, perhaps? There’s not much work needing doing, so they could sell Phillips and sign the next Rodri; at a push, a better centre-back than Dias or Akanji. But both have had great seasons, so I doubt replacing either is a priority. 39 min …and he picks out the leg of the first man. 39 min City win a freo0kick down the left which Foden will take… 38 min “Beating City,” begins Rich Harris. “Ten Hag has already beaten City this season I seem to recall, and Marcus Rashford was the difference. Hard to see United stopping the City juggernaut but plenty of underdogs have won FA Cup Finals, and City losing to Wigan in 2013 is a case in point. I’d say it is a free hit for United as nobody expects them to win.” It’s an Fa Cup final, a derby, and with the treble on the line; I can’t say I’m impartial here, but that’s never a free hit. And whole United did beat City at Old Trafford, City have improved loads since whereas United have looked, for quite some weeks, like a side that’s already played its best football this season. 36 min Chelsea are coming! Hall moseys down the left, crosses well, and when Gallagher heads goalwards, Ortega scurries across, the ball hits the near post, flicks his thigh, ands runs to relative safety. 34 min Fernandez slides a pass in behind for Sterling, and is he in? Er, sort of; Gomez gets back at him well and perhaps the worst finisher to have scored shedloads of goals – see also Lukaku, R – can only slide across Ortega and into his studs. 33 min Ederson has died his hair blue; Laporte appears to have blue highlights. 31 min Fernandez paints a nice ball over the top for Sterling, down the left side of the box, but his attempted square-pass for Havertz is easily intercepted by Akanji. 30 min Later today, Foden will receive his fifth title-winner’s medal. He’s 22. 29 min Phillips launches a gorgeous diag towards Foden, now on the right, which he kills with a leaping touch, before trying an outswinging lob that sails over Kepa and wide – just. 29 min Apparently Chelsea are also playing. We’re investigating. 28 min “As a Chelsea fan,” tweets Brendan Large, “I am concerned that the plan may be to get Haaland on in the last 30 mins to improve his goal tally.” If he comes on, my guess is it’ll be to keep him moving and in rhythm, rather than to score a few more – though of course if he’s on the pitch, that’s not unlikely. 27 min Mahrez teases Hall became he can, tempting him in, swaying, and laying off. Meantime, in the stands, the Poznan. 25 min I’m certain Inzaghi will look to beat City in a different way, packing midfield and defending deep. That can work, but will require some serious focus and patience, along with some brilliance from Barella, Martinez or, er, Darmian or Mkhitaryan. 24 min And here the come again, Foden streaking forward, playing a one-two with Lewis and finding Palmer – he’s made a fine start to the game. Another low cross follows, but this one is kicked away by Chalobah when it’s deflected towards the goalline. 23 min Back on the pitch, City are knocking the ball around with embarrassing ease. 22 min I doubt Ten Hag does either of those things, though. My guess is he’ll look to win the game on the counter and on the counter-press, problem being without Lisandro Martínez, he lacks a defender able to get the ball moving in timely fashion. 21 min So, about beating City. If I was Ten Hag, I’d play Shaw not Lindelof at centre-back because much as the latter has done well lately, him getting ragdolled by Haaland looks a strong possibility. Then, up front, I’d be thinking hard about using Garnacho on the left to attack the space outside Walker – there’s no point bringing him on after 70 if it’s 4-0 – though Martial’s ability to hold the ball up would be helpful. 19 min Alvarez boots Fofana’s studs as they contest a loose ball, and that looks a right sair yin. But he’ll be fine. 18 min Havertz slides in on Phillips and is so late it’s almost last season. He’s booked, and I wonder what’s going to become of him. I really thought he was special when I saw him at Leverkusen, and assumed at some point, things would just click. But three seasons later, he doesn’t seem any better than he was then, and I bet Boehly would take a decent offer for him. 17 min So how do you go about beating City. If I was Erik ten Hag or Simone Inzaghi, I’d be going out round about now, and not coming back until I had a plan. more of that in a sec… 16 min In co-comms, Gary Nev notes that Azpilicueta reminds him of himself when he was finished, knackered after 10 minutes, and also that Lampard looks like a player who really doesn’t like his players. 15 min Here come City again – if they keep this up, Chelsea are in all sorts – Palmer weaving down the left and clipping back, for both Lewis and Alavarez to try backheels before Mahrez thrashes over from a narrow angle. 14 min On which point, what a signing Alvarez has been an all-purpose forward able to play across the front and with the speed, movement and aggression to be an immediate threat against anyone. This is so, so easy and so, so competent. Fofana picks out Phillips who sets Palmer away through the middle, he then punches to Alvarez outside him, and a fine first touch at inside-right, dragging ball into stride, allows him to slide across Kepa and into the far corner. 12 min Ah, I meant to say, Joao Felix pulled out of the game pre-match, so is replaced on the Chelsea bench by Ethan Wady, their third-choice keeper. 11 min Palmer controls a long pass nicely and again skates by Azpilicueta on the outside, but this time, the defenders gets back at him like the wily old sod he is. 10 min Fernandez is down after Walker slides in to win a loose ball then lifts his foot in the follow-through, catching yerman in the shin. He’ll be fine. 9 min “Most Important reason that City stay focused?” asks Richard Hirst of himself. “Because anything except a Chelsea win means they will finish below Fulham!” That is remarkable, it really is – what a season Fulham have had. What a season Chelsea have had! 8 min Again, the corner is cleared to the edge, where Foden takes down and pulls a shot wide of the near post. 8 min City win a corner down the right, Mahrez to take… 7 min On which point, though I’m sure he’s in a pretty good mood, it must be rankling with Foden that he’s starting games like this one. He’ll have been the best player in every team at every level, but suddenly he’s on the bench in this one. Partly, it’s because Grealish is in better form than he is, but it’s also the case that Grealish’s ball-holding abilities offer more control to a side that now has a proper centre-forward, not a midfielder mooching about anywhere and everywhere. Which is to say regaining a spot isn’t just about playing better, it’s probably about being different as well. 5 min I thought Foden would play on the left, but he’s off Alvarez through the middle. 4 min Azpilicueta nashes down the right and crosses low, but City clear. 4 min The corner is also cleared to the edge, where Gomez slices across a shot that flies just high and just wide. 3 min Nice from Palmer, doing Azpilicueta for pace by skirting around the outside, then clipping back, and the ball falls for Phillips, whose shot is deflected behind. 1 min It’s a lovely day in Manchester – not words anyone supposed to type, and as I type them, I can feel my Grandma glowering at me from the grave. “It makes me so vexed,” she’d say, whenever anyone challenged the weather in her famously tropical city. 1 min Away we go! “Walker ...should never have left Spurs,” joshes Daniel B. I’m certain he laments the day on a regular. City, players holding kids, enter. They look pretty satisfied at a job well done – at least I think that’s what’s going on, because how would I know? Lacking the comedy value of this one. Here come Chelsea to form the guard of honour. Penny for em, Raheem? Which is before we discuss this new tweak of a defender in midfield. Against some opponents, that gap at left-back might be targeted, but most are just trying to stay in the game, and going forward it allows them swarm with men all over the place. And that’s the thing with Guardiola’s football: it’s so damn hard to beat, harder than any style that’s ever existed. You get 35% possession if you’re doing well, a chunk of that is deep inside your own half, and out of what’s left you generally have to somehow score at least twice to get a draw. Yeah, enjoy! I mentioned below that City’s brilliance is underpinned by money of particular provenance; it’d be dishonest and immoral of me not to. However, it’s also the case that only Guardiola could have these players playing like this. How many of City’s first XI are among the best in the world in their position? I’d go Walker, De Bruyne, Rodri, Haaland, which is to say it takes a genius to deploy in such a way that seem unbeatable. And what a response to his manager saying he couldn’t play the inverted role. No whining, just more ridiculous defending, and it’s hard to see him missing either of the two finals because his pace, strength and nous is helping Guardiola’s new 3-2-4-1 formation work. Kyle Walker: the best right-back of the Premier League era, yes? Guardiola says it’s not especially special doing three in a row, every title is special, but the achievement shows consistency. He then credits Arsenal and Liverpool for pushing his team to its limits, and today is the first day the who squad, staff and suits have been together. Email! “It doesn’t matter how many changes Pep has made,” laments Neal Butler. “I have a feeling Chelsea are going to get murdered today. Then again, I’ve had that same feeling for every match since Lampard took over, and another change of formation isn’t helping.” What I don’t get about this Lampard escapade is why he hasn’t tried to settle some players. The formation next season won’t be up to him, but given what was paid for Mudryk, for example, I don’t get why he’s not been given a run of games to settle. Instead, he’ll now have to do that next season with important points at stake, rather than now, for free. Frank Lampard tells Sky that his team have to respect City’s achievement, and though they’ve made changes, his players need to focus on themselves. It’s a chance for them to show pride in Chelsea and themselves, he reckons. Good luck, lads. As for Chelsea, Frank Lampard has yet another go at making something, anything out of Todd Boehly’s handiwork. Mendy, Badiashile, Kovacic, Madueke and Felix drop out; Kepa, Fofana, Azpilicueta, Loftus-Cheek and Havertz come in. Title in the bag, Pep Guardiola makes changes. Ederson, Dias, Stones, Rodri, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Grealish, Bernardo and Haaland drop out. Ortega, Laporte, Gomez, Lewis, Phillips – making his first league start – Foden, Mahrez, Álvarez and Palmer come in. Or, put another way, Walker and Akanji are the only two who remain from midweek. So let’s have a closer look at those teams… Big, big trouble for Leeds. They now trail West Ham 3-1, and relegation looks close. Manchester City (4-3-3): Ortega; Walker, Akanji, Laporte, Gomez; Lewis, Phillips, Foden; Mahrez, Álvarez, Palmer. Subs: Ederson, Dias, Stones, Gundogan, Haaland, Grealish, Rodri, De Bruyne, B Silva. Chelsea (3-4-1-2): Arrizabalaga; Fofana, T Silva, Chalobah; Azpilicueta, Fernandez, Loftus-Cheek, Hall; Gallagher; Sterling, Havertz. Subs: Mendy, Pulisic, Koulibaly, D Fofana, Mudryk, Joao Felix, Madueke, Chukwuemeka, Ziyech. Referee: Michael Oliver (Ashington) Well that de-escalated quickly. Not long ago, we had a title race, then Pep Guardiola moved John Stones into midfield, his team hit a rolling boil, and Arsenal faltered then kept faltering. The title – City’s seventh in 12, fifth in six and third in a row – is theirs, and the two outstanding legs of the treble feel less in prospect, more inevitable. With good reason. There’s a particular kind of confidence that only comes with success, and all season City have cut about like they know they’ll do whatever it takes to get one point more than their nearest rivals. But in the last few weeks, things have changed: rather than use that knowhow and cunning to slide over the line, they kept it in reserve because form took over, their midweek dematerialisation of Real Madrid up there with the great performances. That kind of thing – every player hitting a simultaneous peak within a structure that fits them perfectly – tends not to happen often, and they may never play quite as well again. Or, alternatively, we may be acclimatising to a new normal. Yeah, about that. Pages such as this one exist mainly to celebrate this beautiful thing of ours, and make no mistake, City are elevating its on-pitch aspect in ridiculous style. Problem being we can’t ignore it provenance: a repressive regime using football as a nationalist tool to build power and influence. Nor can we sidestep the Uefa FFP charges thrown out by Cas partly because of an expired limitation period, or the many alleged Premier League FFP rule-breaches yet to be disproved. So, um, er, yeah, them. But what a team! And then there’s Chelsea! It’s the way we tell ’em! The polar opposite of City’s wise largesse and, in a crowded field, the worst team in per pound spent in football history, they’ve lost six out of eight since the fascinatingly inept decision to appoint Frank Lampard as caretaker manager. Should the champions be in the mood, they could take an epochal beating this afternoon, and even if they don’t, will still endure the chastening experience of applauding them onto the pitch before watching as they accept the trophy … and unlike most of City’s rivals, they can’t even ascend the moral high ground to console themselves.

Schofield announced on Saturday he would step down from presenting the daytime talkshow with immediate effect, after ITV bosses told him “the current situation can’t go on” following weeks of damaging news stories. The presenter had faced extensive coverage that he had fallen out with This Morning co-presenter Holly Willoughby, was criticised for appearing to skip the queue to pay his respects to Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin, and watched as his brother was imprisoned for sex offences involving achild. Schofield, who will not be given a chance to say goodbye to viewers after 21 years on air, said he was stepping down for the good of the show. The presenter, who the Mirror claimed earned £600,000 a year for his work on This Morning in 2017, now faces a battle to retain his other high-profile jobs. ITV has promised him that he will still be able to host next month’s British Soap Awards and an as-yet-unnamed primetime show. But it did not comment on whether he will co-host the next year’s series of iceskating show Dancing on Ice, which he co-hosts with Willoughby. Losing the presenter slot on This Morning will also hit his ability to strike lucrative endorsement deals with brands, having recently lost his roles as the voice of WeBuyAnyCar and at in-house Waitrose wine brand. ITV said Willoughby, who has co-hosted This Morning since 2009, will take an unplanned holiday, ensuring she does not need to comment on Schofield’s departure. She will return to screens on 4 June. It has said Willoughby will continue to host the show and will “co-present with members of the This Morning family” until bosses find a permanent replacement for Schofield. Hammond and O’Leary, who usually co-host This Morning on Fridays, will take over for Monday’s show. Birmingham-born Hammond is a favourite to be promoted to fill Schofield’s space on the sofa after becoming a cult figure for her interviews with celebrities. Schofield said in a statement: “I have always been proud to cover fascinating stories on This Morning. But recently, This Morning itself has become the story. Throughout my career in TV – including the very difficult last few days – I have always done my best to be honourable and kind. “I understand that ITV has decided the current situation can’t go on, and I want to do what I can to protect the show that I love. So I have agreed to step down from This Morning with immediate effect, in the hope that the show can move forward to a bright future.” Willoughby said in a brief statement: “It’s been over 13 great years presenting This Morning with Phil and I want to take this opportunity to thank him for all of his knowledge, his experience and his humour. The sofa won’t feel the same without him.” Schofield took leave from the show last month during his brother’s sexual abuse trial at Exeter crown court. Timothy Schofield, 54, who was a civilian police worker with the Avon and Somerset force at the time of the abuse, was found guilty of 11 sexual offences involving a child. Phillip Schofield had publicly disowned his brother and took pre-planned leave from presenting duties during this period."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/21/eureka-review-booze-bird-souls-and-viggo-mortensen-in-barmy-yet-rich-experimental-enigma","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:50:50Z","webTitle":"Eureka review – booze, bird souls and Viggo Mortensen in barmy yet rich experimental enigma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/eureka-review-booze-bird-souls-and-viggo-mortensen-in-barmy-yet-rich-experimental-enigma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/21/eureka-review-booze-bird-souls-and-viggo-mortensen-in-barmy-yet-rich-experimental-enigma","fields":{"headline":"Eureka review – booze, bird souls and Viggo Mortensen in barmy yet rich experimental enigma","bodyText":"It is the custom now for everyone in the film business to describe film-makers as “storytellers”. But even leaving aside the fact that so many film-makers are not very good at the old-fashioned business of storytelling, the fact is that cinema does not have to be about story, however uncommercial an idea that seems. The Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso is a case in point: his work is challenging and opaque and taken an uncompromisingly andante pace and yes, it is probably destined to be shown at festivals. But it is also weirdly hypnotic and exalted and magnificent in its way, and often has nothing do with story. His last movie, with Viggo Mortensen, entitled Jauja, was a case in point. Now he has come to Cannes with his experimentally non-narrative meditation on the global condition of indigenous peoples. It is entirely fascinating, though undoubtedly it requires the audience to recalibrate their own consumption-tempo and attention span stamina. We begin with an eerily slow black-and-white sequence which appears to be an old-fashioned western, with Viggo Mortensen playing some stranger arriving in a windblown American town in the Old West. From there we shift, in full colour, to a Native American reservation in the contemporary US, where a Native American police officer picks up an actor from that movie by the side of the road with car trouble. This same officer gives the actor a ride to a nearby school where her niece Sadie coaches basketball. Then she resumes her increasingly dreary workload: picking up a violent drunk with a knife and another drunk driver and attending to reports of a fistfight at a casino. But she seems disinclined to answer her dispatcher’s calls for information and this dispatcher’s radio calls seem like wan calls into an empty void. Meanwhile, young Sadie, herself apparently tired of life, calls on her grandfather to give her a potion which will give her deliverance: a brew which causes her soul to change into a large bird which flies through time and space to the Brazilian jungle of the early 70s, where the member of some religious community kills someone in a knife fight and escapes to where gold is being prospected and meets his own strange destiny with the bird-soul as witness. The entirely bizarre narrative or anti-narrative conveys nothing of the film’s dreamy effect, its prose-poetic procedure or its status as artwork. It’s a film which moves laterally away from its starting point and more or less ignores those Aristotelian unities of time and place that most films stick to. And the title is another enigmatic thing about it. There is certainly no obvious “eureka” moment of discovery or understanding. But there is a sort of sensory perception, a feeling that through drifting downstream along the river course of this film and gazing at the foliage on either bank, some progress of the soul is being achieved. It is an enriching experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-tried-to-get-out-of-final-vote-on-small-boats-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:35:37Z","webTitle":"Suella Braverman ‘tried to get out of final vote on small boats bill’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-tried-to-get-out-of-final-vote-on-small-boats-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-tried-to-get-out-of-final-vote-on-small-boats-bill","fields":{"headline":"Suella Braverman ‘tried to get out of final vote on small boats bill’","bodyText":"Suella Braverman tried to get out of the final Commons vote on the government’s small boats bill despite Conservative MPs being instructed to attend, the Guardian has learned. The home secretary’s aides sent multiple emails over the course of several days to the Tory whips’ office requesting that she be “slipped”, or permitted to miss, the third reading of her department’s flagship legislation. Sources said the chief whip, Simon Hart, eventually had to call Braverman directly to instruct her to attend the vote on the illegal migration bill, which had a three-line whip. They claimed that Braverman had wanted to visit a police station instead. One Tory insider said: “The chief is at his wit’s end with Suella. She just thinks she can do what she wants. Her office was really hassling the whips’ admin team to allow her to miss the third reading vote for what appeared to be a picture opportunity.” Rishi Sunak is facing growing pressure over the government’s handling of migration, with the Office for National Statistics publishing data on Thursday which is expected to show that net legal migration has risen from 500,000 and hit an all-time high. On his final day at the G7 summit of world leaders in Japan, Sunak said that he thought overall migration numbers were “too high” and insisted he was “committed to bringing them down”. But he said that his main focus was on curbing the much smaller numbers of people arriving illegally in small boats across the Channel, which the illegal migration bill was designed to do. Braverman’s attempt to miss the vote is likely to further anger Tory MPs who are already despairing over the home secretary’s apparent leadership pitch at the controversial NatCon conference last week, as well as her inflammatory rhetoric around migration. Braverman visited Northamptonshire to highlight the government’s police recruitment programme, and made it back in time for the vote. A source close to the home secretary said: “This is a load of drivel.” The Conservative whips’ office declined to comment. Being slipped, or pairing, is a longstanding convention in the Commons where the whips of the government and an opposition party agree to allow MPs from one side to miss a vote because of personal reasons or official business. Separately, the prime minister is under pressure to launch an investigation by his ethics adviser into whether Braverman broke the ministerial code by asking Home Office civil servants for special treatment over a speeding fine. Sunak also faces claims by former home secretary Priti Patel that he refused an official request for money to speed up asylum processing while he was chancellor, casting doubts on his commitment to getting to grips with the broken system. Patel, an ally of Boris Johnson, accused the prime minister of taking a “sticking plaster” approach to clearing the backlog of 92,601 asylum cases submitted before June 2022 by the end of this year, adding that it was “too late” to make a substantial difference. In an interview with the Inside Whitehall podcast, Patel claimed that Sunak had turned down a Home Office request to fund the digitalisation of claims which are largely paper-based. These are slower to process and contributed to the current backlog. “In 2021, we asked the Treasury for money to reform the asylum processing system. It was completely rejected by the way. We said if you don’t do this you’re going to end up spending more money basically, because it will take longer to process the cases,” Patel said. “The whole system is still very paper based and it was a labour of love to try and persuade the Treasury to give that money. So now they announce resources and it’s a sticking plaster and too late.” Patel also claimed that much of the Nationality and Borders Act, passed while Johnson was still prime minister, had yet to be enacted, adding that “everybody tried to airbrush the significance of that bill”. Sunak last week set a new goal of bringing migration down below the level he “inherited” as prime minister, which was about 500,000 net arrivals a year. Braverman had previously said she believed net arrivals should be under 100,000 a year. The prime minister has made the difficult task of stopping small boat crossings a central mission of his government. “I think illegal migration is undoubtedly the country’s priority, and you can see all the work I’m putting in to that,” he said. A No 10 source said: “As chancellor, the prime minister put over £3bn of investment into the UK’s asylum system, including an additional £85m per year to improve the asylum case-working system and strengthening border security. As prime minister, he has put an unprecedented focus on curbing illegal migration and stopping the boats – making it one of his five top priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/commentisfree/2023/may/21/the-guardian-view-on-englands-water-companies-a-badly-broken-system","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:30:32Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on England’s water companies: a badly broken system | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/may/21/the-guardian-view-on-englands-water-companies-a-badly-broken-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/may/21/the-guardian-view-on-englands-water-companies-a-badly-broken-system","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on England’s water companies: a badly broken system","bodyText":"The revelation should anger all who care about England’s rivers and beaches. Two decades ago, ministers were warned about private equity firms buying up water companies. In a briefing prepared for Britain’s competition regulator prior to the takeover of Southern Water, researchers raised the alarm that private equity-owned water companies would become “impossible” to regulate. Despite the 20-year transparency rule, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has not released the briefing. Its existence was uncovered by this newspaper. Though its full contents remain secret, its implications are clear: ministers were alerted to the devastating impact that this industry could have on England’s water supply, but they chose not to act. Since then, a tide of effluent has polluted England’s rivers. Following the privatisation of water companies in 1989, owners have enriched themselves while neglecting infrastructure and dumping vast quantities of untreated sewage. As investors have loaded water companies with debt, they have continued to pay dividends to their shareholders, which totalled £1.4bn last year. The public, meanwhile, have shouldered the costs. Water bills have risen. Last week, the industry apologised for these sewage spills and pledged to invest £10bn in infrastructure – to be paid for by increases in customer bills. Ruth Kelly, the former Labour cabinet minister who is head of the industry’s trade body, Water UK, said more should have been done to address the spillages. She was silent on the subject of dividend payments. The main line of defence for consumers is supposed to be Ofwat. Yet water companies have run rings around the regulator. Its rules are premised on a version of capitalism that no longer exists. When it was founded in 1989, England’s water suppliers were listed on the stock market, allowing anybody to buy shares in this public resource. Today, most of them have been bought up by investment funds that do not face the same disclosure requirements. Opacity has shielded their finances from scrutiny. Since 2015, water companies have been required to demonstrate their “financial resilience”, and Ofwat will now prevent negligent ones from paying out dividends. But the horse has already bolted, and many of the firms responsible for loading these companies with debt have already moved on. The regulation of England’s water suppliers is grounded in the illusion that it is possible to promote competition in a marketplace of natural monopolies. A narrow focus on competition and prices has led Ofwat to largely ignore other crucial issues such as the environment and the cost to taxpayers, and to overlook the risks posed by financial engineering. In 2007, for example, it credulously took the view that firms’ capital structures (and by implication their dividend payments) “are essentially a matter for companies and the markets”. Meanwhile, the CMA, which has been urged to do more to prevent private equity buyouts, has no remit to investigate these issues. Neither regulator was designed with this industry in mind, and both now find themselves outmanoeuvred by its tricks. Solving these problems requires change from the top. There are two main options for improving England’s spectacularly broken system: empower regulators to restrict financial engineering and prevent companies that load firms with debt from entering this market, or nationalise the water supply. The government seems unwilling to do either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/21/anatomy-of-a-fall-review-sandra-huller-compels-as-an-author-accused-of-her-husbands","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:27:11Z","webTitle":"Anatomy of a Fall review – Sandra Hüller compels as an author accused of her husband’s murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/anatomy-of-a-fall-review-sandra-huller-compels-as-an-author-accused-of-her-husbands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/21/anatomy-of-a-fall-review-sandra-huller-compels-as-an-author-accused-of-her-husbands","fields":{"headline":"Anatomy of a Fall review – Sandra Hüller compels as an author accused of her husband’s murder","bodyText":"I have been agnostic about Justine Triet’s work in the past, but her courtroom drama murder mystery in this year’s Cannes competition, with its ambiguous title and ambiguous dénouement, is very intriguing. It reminded me at various stages of Billy Wilder’s Agatha Christie adaptation Witness for the Prosecution or Steven Bochco’s underrated, under-remembered 90s TV drama Murder One. Sandra Hüller plays Sandra, a successful and fashionable author (that staple figure of French cinema), German by birth, but now living in a handsome chalet in the French Alps with her French husband Samuel (Samuel Theis), a former academic and would-be author himself, who has now hit a career slump and creative block and is currently hoping to salvage the family finances by fixing up the chalet as an Airbnb. It is while he is grumpily sawing and hammering upstairs, with the music on too loud, that Sandra attempts to give an interview, which simply has to be abandoned because of the noise. Sandra wearily attempts to take a nap, while the couple’s son Daniel (Milo Machado Graner) takes their dog Snoop for a walk. But when he returns, his dad’s corpse is lying on the snow outside the chalet with a brutal wound on his head. Did he fall from the top window? Did his head hit something on the way down? Or did someone hit him? Poor Daniel is an unreliable witness because he is blind, the result of an accident which Sandra always blamed on Samuel, who was supposed to be looking after him at the time, and which caused Samuel to spiral into depressive anger; he hated Sandra for her affairs and for plagiarising what he felt was an idea of his — Sandra perhaps still blamed him for their son’s condition. It isn’t long before the cops have snapped the cuffs on Sandra and charged her with murder. She employs as her lawyer an old friend (Swann Arlaud) who may be in love with her. Yet her fate may still lie in the hands of her blind son who saw nothing at all, yet might still remember something convenient at any moment. Sandra Hüller’s calm directness as an actor is what gives the film its texture, substance and emotional force. She anchors it in a kind of accessible reality: we naturally sympathise with her, and yet Triet shows us that she is capable of transparent lies, lies which are almost credible because Hüller is such a plausible personality. The men that surround her seem to be over-emotional, more emotional than her — odd, as she is the one facing a prison sentence. And as the film pursues its own forensic style of drama: we see the body itself examined, and the event itself bizarrely reconstructed by the defence, with a dummy dropped from the window, to determine if the corpse’s trajectory and the resulting blood splatters incriminate Sandra or not. The film does not signpost the traditional twists and turns and dramatic reversals, but keeps a cool distance, letting us wonder if Sandra is guilty or not, and we are kept guessing until the end. It’s a lowkey, almost downbeat drama, but with something invigoratingly cerebral."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/21/the-guardian-view-on-pakistans-army-go-back-to-the-barracks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:25:32Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Pakistan’s army: go back to the barracks | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/21/the-guardian-view-on-pakistans-army-go-back-to-the-barracks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/21/the-guardian-view-on-pakistans-army-go-back-to-the-barracks","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Pakistan’s army: go back to the barracks","bodyText":"The standoff between Imran Khan, Pakistan’s former prime minister, and the country’s military is yet another sign that the political system created by the army is inherently unstable. Since independence, Pakistan’s generals have become ever more involved in running the country – and its civilian leaders ever more dependent on their backing. None of the nation’s 31 prime ministers has completed a full five‑year tenure. Politicians survive in office only if they do as they are told. Trying to regain power against the army’s wishes is a dangerous business. Mr Khan is pushing ahead regardless. With the economy in a mess, he calculates that his best chance of winning an election is for one to be held as soon as possible. He also faces terrorism and corruption charges, which were the pretext on which he ended up in custody earlier this month. Mr Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau, an anti-corruption body headed by a retired general. He says the charges are baseless. But if convicted he risks being disqualified from politics, a fate that befell his recent predecessor Nawaz Sharif, who also clashed with the army. Mr Khan fears watching the elections scheduled for this October unfold from a jail cell – if they are held at all. The standoff between the army and Mr Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has broadened into a wider conflict. His arrest led to PTI supporters ransacking army properties – prompting a military crackdown. The country’s supreme court, headed by the chief justice, freed Mr Khan and declared his arrest illegal. What is emerging is a confrontation between two distinct political groups. Pitted against a section of the judiciary and Mr Khan are, it seems, the generals and the parties they endorse. Unless resolved, the contest will paralyse the country, whose economic troubles have already plunged 4 million Pakistanis into poverty. Even China, Pakistan’s closest ally, is publicly calling for its chaotic politics to be resolved. The military in Pakistan has had many stints in direct control. They have all ended badly. Its attempts to manage politics from behind the scenes have corroded the reputation of the army and the politicians. Some might argue that praetorianism – the backstage rule imposed by soldiers – has a long pedigree. But that is little help today. Pakistan is a nation of 230 million people that requires technocratic expertise coupled with a light touch to navigate a complex society. Former soldiers are widely considered competent, but their takeover of the bureaucracy is a mask for government without consensus. The result is an institutionalised instability. Probably the greatest cricketer his country has ever produced, Mr Khan did not distinguish himself as a brilliant administrator in office. Human Rights Watch has reported on his government’s intensified efforts to control the media and curtail dissent. But Mr Khan’s anti-corruption and pro-welfare platform has made him popular. Good government with an electoral mandate will be needed to negotiate the critical external funding required to avert a balance of payment crisis. Voters, not the generals, ought to be able to judge their leaders on the basis of their performance in office. Pakistan would be better served by having armed forces that are the military arm of the civilian government rather than having a government that is the civilian arm of the military.

A third Premier League title in a row and fifth in six seasons? Check. It had been sealed when Arsenal lost at Nottingham Forest on Saturday evening – what happened on the pitch here felt incidental. It was a party in sky blue, beginning inside the Etihad Stadium when the Chelsea players lined up to give the champions a pre-match guard of honour and rolling all the way through to the pitch invasion from thousands of City fans at full time. The lack of jeopardy or drama did not make the trophy lift any less sweet for the captain, Ilkay Gündogan, or anyone connected to the club. City could reflect on how they had reeled in Arsenal with time to spare, having been eight points behind them in mid-January and again at the start of April, albeit having played one game fewer at that stage. Arsenal have been unable to live with City’s strength in all areas, or their pulverising power. City could bask in their three-peat – something only four top‑division clubs have previously achieved. But, really, it has come to feel all about what they do over the coming weeks in the finals of the FA Cup against Manchester United and the Champions League against Internazionale. “If we are to be considered one of the best teams, we have to win the Champions League,” Pep Guardiola had said on the eve of this game. That the manager is prepared to say so seems to reflect his confidence. And why not? City will start against Inter as the overwhelming favourites for a litany of very good reasons. For them, history beckons. City won here thanks to Julián Álvarez’s 12th-minute goal. Frank Lampard is one of only two visiting managers to have got a result at the Etihad Stadium this season – the 1-1 with his previous club, Everton; City’s other dropped game was the defeat against Brentford. But Lampard’s team were merely the foil for City’s parade. As an aside, Chelsea have now lost six in a row against City in all competitions after their win against them in the 2021 Champions League final, failing to score in any of them. City are getting used to these kind of occasions. Before the game, a six‑piece band played on the approach to the stadium, City flags waving beside them, while a group of fans held a big speaker as they walked up, belting out music, singing their songs. There was a similar vibe in the drinking holes around the ground but, in general, it was pretty chilled, everyone simply enjoying the sunglasses weather. The celebrations had begun the night before at the club’s training complex where some of the players watched the Forest game. They posed for a giant team photograph with members of the support staff and, at that point, Chelsea’s visit was downgraded significantly, thoughts focusing on the keys to City’s season – and what was still to come. Two off-field moments have come to feel pivotal. There was Guardiola’s unprecedented criticism of his players and the supporters after the win against Tottenham on 19 January, the “happy flowers” monologue when he attacked the collective feeling of comfort at the time. And the bombshell of the 100-plus Premier League charges for alleged financial rule breaches announced on 6 February. The day before that, City had lost at Spurs to lag five points behind Arsenal, having played one game more. They then won 13 of 14 in the league leading up to this one, drawing the other at Forest, also motoring into the two cup finals. Have City been bonded by the external threat as much as by Guardiola’s internal motivational move? The match unfolded against a backdrop of noise and triumphalism; a bit of Poznan bouncing, too. Guardiola rotated heavily, starting only Kyle Walker and Manuel Akanji from the XI that he prefers and it was certainly some substitutes’ bench. Newsflash: the back-ups can play a bit, too. City dominated the opening half‑hour. Cole Palmer started brightly on the left wing and it was his pass that set up Álvarez for the breakthrough. Wesley Fofana had played a loose pass out of the Chelsea defence and City transitioned with trademark menace. Guardiola’s team had other chances, Phil Foden chipping one of them inches wide after a lovely first touch on a high ball forward and it felt out of keeping with the overall tone when Chelsea almost equalised. Kai Havertz was denied one-on-one by Stefan Ortega in the 34th minute; then Conor Gallagher headed a Lewis Hall cross against the post. Chelsea are set to finish in the bottom half of the table for the first time since 1995-96 which, incidentally, was the season in which City were relegated after playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying moments of their final game; they had wrongly believed a draw would keep them up. Those were the days when City would find new and novel ways to punish their fans. It is a different story now. The second half meandered. Kalvin Phillips headed against a post. Raheem Sterling had an effort cleared off the line at the other end by the substitute John Stones, although an offside flag had gone up against the Chelsea forward in the buildup. Álvarez had a goal pulled back by the VAR for a Riyad Mahrez handball and Erling Haaland, on to tremendous acclaim, dragged a decent chance wide. César Azpilicueta almost pinched a last-gasp equaliser. Now for United and Inter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2023/may/21/sam-allardyce-turns-on-substitutes-as-drop-looms-over-abject-leeds","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:15:19Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce turns on substitutes after Leeds’ painful defeat at West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/sam-allardyce-turns-on-substitutes-as-drop-looms-over-abject-leeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/21/sam-allardyce-turns-on-substitutes-as-drop-looms-over-abject-leeds","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce turns on substitutes after Leeds’ painful defeat at West Ham","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce criticised his substitutes for failing to step up against West Ham and admitted that Leeds, who are facing the prospect of relegation from the Premier League, will struggle to beat Tottenham on the final day of the season after losing Patrick Bamford and Rodrigo to injury. Leeds would have moved out of the bottom three with a game to go if they had beaten West Ham and they looked to be on track when Rodrigo gave them the lead. But Allardyce’s side failed to hold on and remain two points behind Everton after losing 3-1 at the London Stadium. Everton host Bournemouth on the final day. Leicester, who visit Newcastle on Monday night, are a point below Leeds. Allardyce was hugely disappointed with his side’s performance as West Ham hit back with goals from Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and Manuel Lanzini. Leeds offered little fight and will be short of forwards against Spurs. Bamford went off with a hamstring injury and Rodrigo, who stayed on until the end, was struggling with a foot problem. “Both of them are struggling badly. Rodrigo with a plantar fascia and Patrick with a hamstring and I have to say that the impact of the subs wasn’t as I expected,” Allardyce said of Brendan Aaronson, Wilfried Gnonto and Crysencio Summerville. “I expected a better impact from the subs so that gives me an even bigger look at the situation and the squad as a whole. Unfortunately, I don’t think any of the subs made a difference today when we needed them.” Allardyce was downbeat about his side’s hopes of beating Spurs. “It depends on the injuries that we have to Rodrigo and Patrick Bamford,” he said. “Who am I going to play up front if those two are missing? We might have to choose to play a completely different system with the players we’ve got available to create an opportunity to win a game. Certainly from a defensive point of view, we have to work to keep Harry Kane and Son [Heung-min] quiet.” Allardyce has taken one point from three games since replacing Javi Gracia but he said he had no regrets over joining Leeds. “It’s a challenge of trying to do your best for the club,” he said. “Particularly this club when it’s worked so hard to get back in the Premier League. I can only try my best and give the players the right sort of instructions to show them how to win a game of football. “Unfortunately that hasn’t worked yet. We have to try and get that to work on Sunday. It was always going to be a difficult task. Lots of people said how mad I am taking it, but I’m not mad. I just love football and Leeds United was too big a job to turn down for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/21/new-york-mayor-homeless-mental-illness-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:13:32Z","webTitle":"Mayor pushes plan to force homeless New Yorkers with mental illness to seek help","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/21/new-york-mayor-homeless-mental-illness-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/21/new-york-mayor-homeless-mental-illness-plan","fields":{"headline":"Mayor pushes plan to force homeless New Yorkers with mental illness to seek help","bodyText":"New York mayor Eric Adams has warned that there are “more Jordan Neelys out there”, invoking the name of the unhoused man who was killed on the subway earlier in May as the Democratic mayor pushed his idea to force people with mental illness to access help. In an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, Adams called a dearth of such services – particularly for the city’s unhoused population – “a very real issue”. Neely, 30, died after 24-year-old Daniel Penny put him in a chokehold. Penny, who previously served in the marines, has been charged with manslaughter despite his claims of self-defense in a case that has inflamed racial tensions nationwide because he is white and Neely was Black. Adams said: “The case is now in the hands of the district attorney. I have a lot of confidence in DA [Alvin] Bragg. “I am clear on this. I can’t control the outcome of the case but I can control how we continue to address a very real issue,” Adams said. New York saw street protests demanding Penny’s arrest for Neely’s death. Adams alluded to earlier remarks that he had made calling for the “involuntary removal to the hospitals of those who are unable to take care of basic needs and they are [a] danger to themselves”. In November, Adams announced plans for authorities and emergency services to more aggressively hospitalize mentally ill people involuntarily, even if they do not pose any active threat to others. At the time of the announcement, Adams said his directive was an attempt to clear up a “gray area where policy, law and accountability have not been clear”, and he said that it was an “moral obligation to act” in response to a “crisis we see all around us”. Adams’s announcement faced swift backlash from civil rights organizations, unhoused people and their advocates, with the New York Civil Liberties Union accusing Adams of “playing fast and loose with the legal rights of New Yorkers and … not dedicating the resources necessary to address the mental health crises”. During Sunday’s interview, Adams urged the codification of involuntary removals, saying: “We need state health to codify what the courts have already ruled. That is the real issue. There are more Jordan Neelys out there. “And when I’m in the subway system speaking with them trying to get them into care, we know that we have to have help on a state level to codify this law.” Last year, the mayor, a former police officer, also announced a new subway safety plan and promised the expansion of outreach teams consisting of clinicians and police officers, which critics also condemned as cracking down against people experiencing mental illness and homelessness. Prior to his death, Neely had been a Michael Jackson impersonator. He had dealt with various mental health problems, including schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder after his mother was murdered by an abusive partner when Neely was 14. According to police, Neely had over 40 prior arrests, and he had previously been accused of punching a fellow subway passenger. He also had over a dozen mental health encounters with police but had apparently not received mental health support. On the day of his death, Neely boarded a train and pleaded to passengers that he was hungry, homeless and thirsty. Penny placed him in a chokehold for several minutes. After Neely’s killing, Republicans have been swift to embrace Penny as he contests charges of second-degree manslaughter. More than $1m has been raised for Penny’s legal defense, largely through the Christian fundraising website GiveSendGo. The site also hosted fundraising efforts for US Capitol attack participants and Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot two racial justice demonstrators dead in Wisconsin and was acquitted of murder charges by claiming self-defense. During Neely’s funeral at a Harlem church on Friday, the civil rights activist and pastor Al Sharpton called for more support for people living with mental illnesses. “A Good Samaritan helps those in trouble. They don’t choke him out,” Sharpton said. “People keep criminalizing people that need help. “They don’t need abuse – they need help.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2023/may/21/phillip-schofield-children-tv-star-ousted-this-morning-presenter","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T17:01:16Z","webTitle":"How Phillip Schofield went from children’s TV star to ousted This Morning host","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/21/phillip-schofield-children-tv-star-ousted-this-morning-presenter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2023/may/21/phillip-schofield-children-tv-star-ousted-this-morning-presenter","fields":{"headline":"How Phillip Schofield went from children’s TV star to ousted This Morning host","bodyText":"Phillip Schofield’s biographer once described the TV presenter as the “hottest star in Britain today” with a “glorious, uplifting life story”. Schofield, they said, had “triumphed at everything he has done” enabling him to lead a life of “love and passion, weeping and laughter, death, tragedy, and heartstopping joy”. Those comments were written in 1992 by a young showbiz journalist called Piers Morgan, the author of a now out of print book entitled To Dream a Dream: the Amazing Life of Phillip Schofield. Three decades later both men are mainstays of British television. But while Morgan has built a persona as one of the country’s resident controversialists, Schofield built a career as the cheery face of light entertainment shows – a career that is now under threat thanks to a series of damaging press stories. Schofield, 61, has been a household name in the UK for most of his life after starting work in the media as a teenager. Raised in Cornwall, he had a short stint as a television presenter in New Zealand before returning as a BBC children’s presenter – appearing on shows such as the Saturday morning programme Going Live! with puppet Gordon the Gopher and being tackled to the ground at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party by Carter USM. As Schofield’s audience aged, he moved on to more mainstream shows. He landed at This Morning in 2002 as a temporary presenter following the arrest of then presenter John Leslie, later released without charge. The mid-morning ITV show has a cultural reach that goes far beyond the million or so viewers who tune in to watch its mix of topical discussion, cooking, celebrity, and competitions. Its audience skews heavily female and they are often consumers of online celebrity websites such as MailOnline, creating a feedback loop that drives intensive coverage of its hosts. Schofield, initially a stand-in presenter, remade the show in his image. Fern Britton, his original co-host, quit the programme in 2009 amid rumours of a rift between the two over issues such as unequal pay. ITV bosses chose to replace Britton with the younger Holly Willoughby, another former children’s television presenter, marking the start of the “Phil and Holly” era. The pair would regularly go viral for talking points, laughing with chef Gino D’Acampo, and being praised for their chemistry. Sometimes thing would go wrong, such as in 2012 when Schofield presented the then prime minister, David Cameron, with a list he had found on the internet naming politicians alleged to be paedophiles. Schofield told a visibly baffled prime minister that it took him “about three minutes last night to continually find a list of the same names”. He later apologised, as some of the names on the list may have been identifiable to viewers. As Willoughby’s star rose, her once strong relationship with Schofield started to suffer. One issue behind the scenes was the relationship between the duo’s agents. For many years both presenters were represented by YMU, formerly James Grant management, a talent agency that dominates the British light entertainment sector, with clients such as Ant and Dec and Simon Cowell. In 2020 Willoughby decided to split with the company and start her own agency, Roxy Management – leading to an expensive court case over her earnings. Having different representatives for the two This Morning stars meant their agents could be easily working against each other and briefing the media. Around the same time Schofield unexpectedly told viewers that, following his long marriage to Stephanie Lowe, he had realised he was gay. He said Holly had been “kind and wise” about the news as he sobbed on her shoulder. His decision to discuss his sexuality on a Friday morning episode of This Morning was followed days later by an exclusive interview in the Sun on Sunday. The beginning of the end for Schofield and This Morning came with the death of Queen Elizabeth II and “Queuegate”. With tens of thousands of people queueing overnight to file past the deceased monarch’s coffin in Westminster Abbey, Schofield and Willoughby took up an offer available to journalists who wanted to report on proceedings and gain direct access to the venue. What was supposed to be a respectful pilgrimage turned into a public scandal, as members of the public who had waited in line for hours watched as the This Morning presenters walked in a side entrance. With little other news, it became one of the biggest talking points in the country as the visibly uncomfortable pair tried to ignore the topic. Schofield then had to deal with the public trial of his brother Timothy Schofield. He was jailed last week for sexually abusing a teenage boy. Phillip took a leave of absence from TV during the court case as press reports suggested Willoughby had been blindsided by the trial. No one is pretending Schofield’s departure from This Morning was his choice. His own statement makes clear that ITV bosses “decided the current situation can’t go on” and given his current contract was already due to expire in September, the real question is whether drawing a line under this is enough to maintain his slots presenting other high-profile ITV shows such as Dancing on Ice, which he co-hosts with Willoughby. All ITV has said is that he will host next month’s British Soap Awards and “a new prime time series”. When Schofield was interviewed for Morgan’s biography in 1992, the TV presenter was asked about a long-forgotten minor controversy in his career. Schofield gave a straightforward message to his critics: “They can all naff off.” He may be feeling the same today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/ukraine-zelenskiy-denies-russian-claims-to-have-taken-bakhmut","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T16:46:48Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: Zelenskiy denies Russian claims to have taken Bakhmut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/ukraine-zelenskiy-denies-russian-claims-to-have-taken-bakhmut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/ukraine-zelenskiy-denies-russian-claims-to-have-taken-bakhmut","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine: Zelenskiy denies Russian claims to have taken Bakhmut","bodyText":"Ukraine has rejected Russian claims to have captured Bakhmut, insisting its forces still have a foothold in the Donbas city and are steadily encircling the Russian mercenaries holding the ruined town centre. It was impossible to verify the conflicting claims in a battle of attrition for a devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall, as Kyiv prepares to unleash a broader counteroffensive against Putin’s occupation forces. “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told a press conference at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. He said that images of Hiroshima after it was flattened by the atom bomb dropped by the US in 1945, reminded him of Bakhmut. But he did concede little of the city remained intact. “You have to understand that there is nothing. They destroyed everything. For today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing in this place … just ruins and a lot of dead Russians,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy was speaking after the head of the Wagner mercenary organisation, Yevgeny Prigozhin, posed amid the wreckage with some of his fighters on midday on Saturday, and claimed they controlled the whole of Bakhmut. Later, Vladimir Putin congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artyomovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]”. Nevertheless, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian forces were still “holding the defence” in the city’s “airplane area” referring to the destroyed MiG-17 monument at Bakhmut’s western entrance close to a multistorey block Wagner claimed had been the last building held by Ukrainian forces, as well as some infrastructure sites, a residential area and some high ground overlooking the centre. Furthermore, Maliar said: “Our forces have taken the city in a semi-encirclement, which gives us the opportunity to destroy the enemy … the enemy has to defend himself in the part of the city he controls.” Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, said in a Telegram post that his troops were advancing through Bakhmut’s suburbs and were approaching a “tactical encirclement” of the city. Bakhmut is about 34 miles north of the Russian-held regional capital of Donetsk. Before the war it had a population of 70,000 and was an important industrial centre, surrounded by salt and gypsum mines. It is of questionable strategic importance in the struggle for the Donbas, other than a symbolic prize. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, suggested Russian claims of victory were aimed at drawing attention away from Zelenskiy’s recent high-profile trips overseas, including to the G7 summit. “This is not the first time Prigozhin has said ‘we seized everything and are dominating’.” While Wagner claimed to have occupied every building in the city itself, heavy fighting appeared to be continuing just beyond the outskirts of the city around Ivanivske, Stupochky and Bila Hora, suggesting the wider Bakhmut sector was still being heavily contested. Both Russia and Ukraine have endured losses believed to be in the thousands, though neither has disclosed casualty numbers. Speaking in Japan, Joe Biden put Russian casualties at 100,000 from the battle for Bakhmut alone. Zelenskiy left the G7 summit in Hiroshima with some significant diplomatic successes. His calls for international solidarity in defence of his country were the focal point of the meeting of a group of major powers that once included Russia. He was able to pin down US support for a programme to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F16 fighter jets and pledges of more weaponry and ammunition. Biden insisting that Ukraine’s backers “will not waver.” “Putin will not break our resolve as he thought he could,” the US president told reporters after meeting with Zelenskiy. After Moscow failed in its efforts to capture Kyiv and install its own puppet regime at the beginning of the war in 2022, Russia threw most of its efforts into capturing a series of important cities in the Donbas, including Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, with Bakhmut seen as a stepping stone to that wider ambition. But the Russian advance became bogged down around Bakhmut as the small city took on an outsized importance for the Kremlin despite its minor strategic importance. The claimed Russian victory was dismissed by analysts as largely insignificant. In its daily update on Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War said the claimed capture of the last urban areas “does not grant Russian forces operationally significant terrain to continue conducting offensive operations or any particularly strong position from which to defend against possible Ukrainian counterattacks”. Images posted online on Saturday evening appeared to show the city, which has been reduced to rubble in the longest battle of the conflict in Ukraine, being hit by dozens of incendiary munitions. Whether or not they managed to hold Bakhmut, Russian forces will still face the massive task of seizing the part of the Donetsk region that remains under Ukrainian control, including several heavily fortified areas and less favourable terrain that is more advantageous to defenders. Beyond Bakhmut, Kyiv has had months to dig miles of new trenches in the open countryside while also heavily fortifying positions in the nearby cities with the higher ground to the west of Bakhmut occupied by Ukrainian artillery positions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/21/ken-westbury-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T16:36:54Z","webTitle":"Ken Westbury obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/21/ken-westbury-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/21/ken-westbury-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ken Westbury obituary","bodyText":"Pennies from Heaven, Dennis Potter’s groundbreaking 1978 television series about a travelling sheet music-seller of the 1930s, featured Bob Hoskins in daydreaming scenes where he lip-synced to popular songs of the time. Ken Westbury’s cinematography, particularly his use of light, was instrumental in giving those sequences a surreal, dreamlike quality that provided the fantasy element into which the drama – and the character – could escape from reality. Westbury, who has died of skin cancer aged 96, became a film camera operator and director of photography in television after a grounding in cinema at Ealing Studios on classic comedies such as Whisky Galore! and Kind Hearts and Coronets (both 1949). Over 40 years, mostly with the BBC, he switched from the police series Z Cars (from 1962 to 1964) and period pieces including The Forsyte Saga (1967) to sci-fi, filming for four different Doctor Who adventures between 1966 and 1978. When he worked with Potter again on The Singing Detective (1986), directed by Jon Amiel, the New York Times wrote: “Mr Amiel and his cinematographer, Ken Westbury, use every inch of the television screen to make the most of shapes, colours, light and movement.” Of the drama’s unusual technical demands, Westbury recalled: “We had to pan completely 180 degrees round the [hospital] ward and finish at exactly the right moment on the nurse at the desk as the tune ended.” Earlier, in television’s black-and-white era, with the flamboyant director Ken Russell, he made programmes for the arts series Monitor. The most notable was The Debussy Film: Impressions of the French Composer (1965), a biopic written by Russell and Melvyn Bragg, with Oliver Reed in the lead role. Westbury helped to achieve the director’s vision through his stark, sensual images and, again, use of light, such as in a woodland scene where it pierces through tree leaves as Debussy swings in a hammock while his lover plays with a balloon. Working as a cinematographer shooting on film sometimes took him abroad. For all three series of the female prisoner-of-war drama Tenko (1981-84) and the 1985 feature-length Tenko Reunion, Westbury enjoyed time in Singapore. He was in Switzerland for Dr Fischer of Geneva (1984), starring James Mason, and again for Potter’s lavishly produced adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel Tender Is the Night (1985), also shot in France. Ken was born in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, to Kathleen (nee Gibson) and Albert Westbury, a postal worker. In 1942, on leaving Willesden technical college aged 15, he joined the camera workshop at Ealing Studios – famous for its screen comedies – running errands and sweeping the floor. He progressed to clapper loader, working on films such as Champagne Charlie (1944), then focus puller. During three years’ national service (1945-48) after the second world war, he was a wireless operator and armoured-car driver with the Household Cavalry’s Life Guards, serving in Germany, Egypt and Palestine. Westbury returned to Ealing Studios as clapper loader on Whisky Galore!, with location filming on Barra, in the Western Isles, Scotland. He clocked up more than 20 other feature films, including the comedy The Man in the White Suit (1951) and the wartime drama The Cruel Sea (1953). Ealing’s golden era eventually ended and, in 1956, the studios were sold to the BBC, which based its film department there. Westbury joined it and, within a year, was promoted to film camera operator. He worked on many popular TV series, including the police drama Dixon of Dock Green (from 1961 to 1964), reuniting him with Jack Warner, who as the programme’s title character had starred in the 1950 Ealing Studios film The Blue Lamp, on which Westbury was clapper loader. Westbury enjoyed particular success shooting The Forsyte Saga, the BBC’s last major drama to be made in black-and-white, which was popular worldwide. His other period productions included the nautical “soap with salt” The Onedin Line (1971), filming along the Devon coast, and When the Boat Comes in (1976), set in the Depression-hit north-east of England between the wars. He also did location filming for Warship (1973-77), including helicopter shots of the vessel breaking the waves for the opening titles and a rocky journey through the Bay of Biscay, and Donald Wilson’s 10-part adaptation of Anna Karenina (1977), in Hungary. In 1978, for the wartime-resistance drama Secret Army, he filmed across England’s home counties and in Belgium, while the romantic costume serial Penmarric (1979) took him to Cornwall. Providing film inserts for Doctor Who included enterprisingly shooting through wagon wheel spokes for the western adventure The Gunfighters (1966) and battling bad weather in a helicopter over the Thames estuary for Fury from the Deep (1968). On reaching 60, then the BBC’s compulsory retirement age, Westbury turned freelance and filmed for programmes across all channels, from Malcolm Bradbury’s comedy The Gravy Train (1990) on Channel 4, and Chimera (1991) and a 1999 Ruth Rendell Mysteries story on ITV, to the 1994 and 1995 series of Pie in the Sky and 1997 episodes of Silent Witness on the BBC. As the director of photography on the ITV production of the Catherine Cookson story The Black Velvet Gown (1991), he helped the film win an International Emmy award as best drama. He personally won the Royal Television Society’s 1987 judges’ award. In 1949, Westbury married Doreen White; she died in 2013. He is survived by their four children, Nigel, Janet, Mark and Simon. The cinematographer John Daly is his son-in-law. • Albert Kenneth Westbury, cinematographer, born 5 January 1927; died 28 April 2023"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2023/may/21/john-nicholson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T16:35:41Z","webTitle":"John Nicholson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/21/john-nicholson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/may/21/john-nicholson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Nicholson obituary","bodyText":"My father, John Nicholson, who has died aged 82, was director of music at the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun over two fruitful decades. The number of international music professionals who graduated during John’s era was incredibly high, and he had a gift for being able to match pupils to instruments, even ones they had never considered. The percussionist Chris Brannick recalled that John persuaded him into action by saying: “You’re a music scholar and we need a timpanist. Really, all you do is hit it!” When he arrived at Gordonstoun in 1972, it was struggling in the musical sphere. But by the time he left in 1991, it was a centre of excellence, often producing performances of a near-professional standard. His love of music was nurtured by his parents, Mary (nee Radcliffe), a school head, and Cyril Nicholson, a bank clerk, who took him from a young age to performances of the Hallé Orchestra. John attended Manchester grammar school where he distinguished himself particularly in English. A child exhibitioner at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern College of Music), he became a full-time student in 1958, studying piano and cello. He began teaching in 1962 and developed an interest in the potential for opera in school settings. In 1968 he accepted a scholarship to study stage management at the London Opera Centre, and the following year he was invited to join the Royal Opera House stage management team, where he worked for three years under Stella Chitty. In 1972 he accepted the post at Gordonstoun. He developed the school orchestra and choir, touring them internationally every second year. However, his foremost love was the operas, and supported by his second wife, the chorister and singing teacher Mary (nee Ferguson), whom he had married in 1971, he made challenging projects happen at the school, whether commissioning Norse operas by the composer David Bedford, performing Mozart classics, or staging the first non-professional production of Benjamin Britten’s Albert Herring. He and Mary were also proxy parents to hundreds of children, offering pastoral as well as musical support. In the mid 1970s John founded the Gordonstoun Concert Society, bringing international musicians into the orbit of the school. These included names such as John Ogdon, Steven Isserlis (who during his visit joined the school’s football team for training) and Pascal Rogé. For more than 60 years, John suffered from the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis. The disease lead to numerous operations, which he bore with patience and resolve. In retirement he developed Schubertline, a website devoted to songs from the classical repertoire, which was launched in 2001 and still continues to supply online access to over four thousand scores. He is survived by Mary and me; by three children, Harriet, David and Frances from his first marriage, to Jane (nee Bennet) which ended in divorce; and by nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2023/may/21/the-crown-prosecution-service-isnt-cherrypicking-its-making-the-right-calls","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T16:30:54Z","webTitle":"The Crown Prosecution Service isn’t ‘cherrypicking’.

However, evidence from my organisation, His Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, suggests a different set of conclusions. Between 2021 and 2022 my inspectors inspected a sample of 1,260 cases across all 14 CPS areas. We found that the CPS made the correct charging decision in 94% of those cases. In our recent inspection of the CPS’s handling of domestic abuse cases, we found 97.3% of the cases complied with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. In all of those cases where the CPS did not take further action, it had made the right decision. Sir Mark clearly does appreciate the need for us to identify and examine the best ways for the police and the CPS to collaborate to bring about fair and just outcomes in the courts. Together with the chief inspector of His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire &amp; Rescue Services, I have commissioned an inspection to examine communication and collaboration between the CPS and police service.

Hard-working FDA members and their colleagues in the CPS are often working through the night from home to provide charging advice and decisions, fulfilling their obligations under the Code for Crown Prosecutors to assess whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction for each case sent to them by the police. Poor file quality, including a paucity of evidence, means that some of the cases presented to the CPS simply cannot be successfully prosecuted, and police should be working with prosecutors to avoid this. If evidence becomes available later, the police can also seek to have the case reviewed. It is a waste of taxpayers’ money, and justice is not served, if we are prosecuting cases where the evidence is not there – raising the expectations of victims and witnesses, and holding defendants in custody who are subsequently acquitted. Or worse still, a judge throws out a case before it’s put before a jury due to a lack of evidence, with the defendant having spent months on remand, and victims and witnesses having prepared themselves for a trial that doesn’t take place.

Our young have become sacrificial lambs on the altar of growth economics. Europe is busy leading the way with the recent Beyond Growth conference and manifestos from the EU Wellbeing Economy Coalition and Generation Climate Europe.

As it becomes so apparent that Brexit has failed to deliver, surely an honest recognition of this, allied to clearly thought out strategies and policies to move back into membership of the EU, would make sense to voters, even in “red wall” areas (which are among those affected worst by recent policies). Straight talking from leading politicians would contrast with the recent evasions and lies from the current government. Would the EU welcome us back? What would be the costs and benefits? For a start, it would discourage many Scots from pushing for independence if the UK were part of the EU again. Somebody ought to be asking these questions loudly and clearly.

But his appetite for booze, porn and fast food (he’s “addicted to the 20th century”) leads to his self-destruction. A 400-page riff with “oodles of dash and heft and twang”, stuffed with unforgettable set pieces, Money is a comic masterpiece underpinned with sadness. In a nutshell: his best novel; it’s not even close. The Moronic Inferno and Other Visits to America (1986) Amis loved America – “more like a world than a country” – and eventually settled there. This collection of interviews and journalism shows him at once wide-eyed with wonder (“What’s he got?” he asks of Steven Spielberg. “How do you do it? Can I have some?”) and aptly sceptical: Kurt Vonnegut is a “playful infantilist”; Ronald Reagan’s “hair can’t be a day over forty-five.” In a nutshell: capital entertainment on the world’s entertainment capital. The Information (1995) There’s a gentleness to the third of Amis’s “London trilogy”, after the scabrous animation of Money and London Fields. Hopeless, hapless writer Richard Tull hates his bestselling best friend Gwyn Barry and determines to “fuck [him] up”. It’s a comedy steeped in the approach of death, but still has time to observe blossoms falling “in festive and hysterical profusion, as if all the trees were getting married”. In a nutshell: his most underrated novel. Experience (2000) “My life looked good on paper – where, in fact, almost all of it was being lived.” Amis’s memoir introduced us to a kinder, more humane man – “easily moved to tears” – than we expected from the novels. His account of his father Kingsley’s death (after which he was “not the kid any more”, Saul Bellow told him) is exceptional. In a nutshell: Amis for people who don’t like Amis. The War Against Cliche: Essays and Reviews 1971-2000 (2001) Probably the most thumbed volume of essays and reviews on the shelves of Amis-admirers. A new book by Norman Mailer was written “very fast ... for a well-known reason. When, oh when, will all the kids grow up, all the wives remarry?” He’s honest, too, about how boring some classics are: Don Quixote is like “an indefinite visit from your most impossible senior relative”. In many cases, Amis’s reviews have outlived the books they’re about.

Both men spoke of the importance to them both of sensitively telling the story of a succession of murders that terrorised the Osage people in Oklahoma in the mid-1920s. These killings were motivated by a desire to ensure the new wealth created by oil found on the Osage reservation fell into the hands of white incomers. Scorsese said he had been so deeply influenced by his encounters with the Native Americans that he switched the film’s focus and decided to tell the story of the crimes from the victims’ perspective. The 80-year-old director, whose Catholicism has been a dominant theme in many of his films to date, attended a series of Osage council sessions in which he observed their prayers and rituals. “I was so affected and so moved,” he said. “I know what their values are and [that they are] really understanding how to live on this planet. It reoriented me every time they spoke.” Joining Scorsese at the press conference was Chief Standing Bear, leader of the Osage Nation, who said that his people still suffer to this day. “But I can say on behalf of the Osage Nation that Scorsese and his team have restored trust,” he added. Killers of the Flower Moon was rapturously received at its premiere on Saturday evening at Cannes, where it is showing out of competition. Scorsese’s 26th feature – and, at almost four hours, one of his longest – is adapted from David Grann’s nonfiction book of the same name. Questioned about his radical approach to this source material, much of which was rejected in favour of a revisionist take on the case, Scorsese said: “As far as taking risks at this age, what else can I do? Do a comfortable film? Like sitting on a set in the heat is comfortable? We might as well be risking something.” The director credited the film’s star, Leonardo DiCaprio, with steering much of the story, saying that he and the actor had first imagined the film as being told from the point of view of the FBI. “I felt it is not a whodunnit, but a who-didn’t-do-it. But then Leo asked me: ‘Where is the heart of this story?” The pair, who had already worked together on five feature films, then concentrated on a real-life character who was “least written about”: an apparent chancer called Ernest Burkhart, who married into the Osage community and became embroiled in the murders. “I said: ‘Let’s create Ernest as a template for that tragedy of love, trust and betrayal,” said Scorsese, “and what happened to the Indigenous people.’” De Niro plays DiCaprio’s uncle, and said some of the “systemic racism” shown in the film became clearer to him after witnessing reactions to the killing of George Floyd almost three years ago. “It is the banality of evil, the thing we have to watch out for,” he said, adding: “We see it today.” The actor has long been a vocal critic of the former president Donald Trump and compared public reaction to his election to the casual inhumanity depicted in the film. “There are people that think he could do a good job – imagine how insane that is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2023/may/21/sean-keane-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:43:25Z","webTitle":"Seán Keane obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/21/sean-keane-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/21/sean-keane-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Seán Keane obituary","bodyText":"Before Riverdance became a global Irish dance sensation, and standing apart from the raucous and good-time Irish music of the Clancy Brothers, the Dubliners and the Pogues, there was the Chieftains: Irish traditional music, arranged and played in an exciting and popular style without compromising its integrity. Paddy Moloney, on uilleann pipes and whistle,may have been the central figure and spokesperson for the band, but his fellow musicians were just as accomplished. Seán Keane, who has died aged 76, became the band’s lead fiddle player, first playing with the Chieftains in 1968 and making his last appearance with them in April to perform for President Joe Biden on his visit to Ireland. He was a virtuoso musician, displaying a technical mastery of the fiddle that few could equal. In 1963, the Dublin label Claddagh Records asked Moloney to put together a band to record an album: The Chieftains became the name of the album and the band. Seán’s debut with the Chieftains was at an open-air concert at the Edinburgh festival, and his first recording was on the album The Chieftains 2 album in 1969. He really made his mark on The Chieftains 4 (1973) with his solo, The Bucks of Oranmore. For his first seven years in the band, Seán and his fellow Chieftains were still fitting full-time jobs around their band commitments, which included a trip to New York for a single concert in 1972 with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the audience. Then, on St Patrick’s Day 1975, the promoter Jo Lustig booked them into the Royal Albert Hall in London. Disbelieving Lustig’s claim that he would fill the hall, they promised that if he did, they would turn professional. The broadcaster John Peel introduced the band on stage to a full house. With Seán in a secure job as a post office telegraph engineer, and raising a young family, his wife, Marie, was opposed to the uncertainty of a musical career, but he agreed to a three-year trial period. He never returned to the post office. The Chieftains toured the world, collaborating with a wide range of musicians and musical genres. They performed on the Great Wall of China with Chinese musicians, with Mexican musicians and Ry Cooder, and with Luciano Pavarotti, James Galway, Van Morrison, the Rolling Stones and Madonna. In 1992 they recorded Another Country in Nashville with a host of country music performers including Ricky Skaggs, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson. Seán also played alongside his teenage idol, the guitarist Chet Atkins, on an unlikely pairing of Heartbreak Hotel and The Cliffs of Moher. The band performed for Pope John Paul II in 1979 and for Queen Elizabeth II on her first official visit to Ireland in 2011. They brought Irish traditional music to new audiences, including at the Glastonbury festival in 1982. During Seán’s time with the Chieftains, the band won six Grammys and a lifetime achievement award at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Seán won the TG4 television station traditional musician of the year award in 2004. In 2022, the Irish Traditional Music Archive in Dublin completed a film documentary, Seán Keane: A Portrait of an Artist, to celebrate his lifetime of music making. In the film, the fiddler and Bothy Band founder, Paddy Glackin, spoke of Seán’s exceptional bow-to-string contact, the flamboyance of his playing and his ability to uncover different tonal colours. “His playing of Dark Lochnagar was emotional and spiritual,” Glackin said. Seán fully understood and absorbed the regional styles of Irish fiddle playing but was particularly drawn to those from County Clare and the Sliabh Luachra area of Kerry, Cork and Limerick. Born in Dublin, he had a childhood filled with music. His father, Patrick, who worked in the Clondalkin paper mills, and mother, Mary, were both fiddle players, and Seán took up the instrument at the age of six. At nine, he was spotted playing alongside his brother James on accordion by Moloney, who immediately recognised his talent. Seán was accepted by the Dublin College of Music to study classical music, which he later acknowledged greatly improved his traditional music playing technique. By the age of 14 he was also playing traditional music in a variety of bands, including the Castle Ceílí Band with his brother. Leaving Drimnagh Castle school at 16, he first became an apprentice boiler maker. By the age of 18 he had been invited by the composer and arranger Seán Ó’Riada to join Ceoltóirí Chualann, the forerunner of the Chieftains, which presented Irish traditional music in the style of a chamber orchestra. Fellow members included future members of the Chieftains, Moloney and the fiddle player Martin Fay. In addition to his recordings with the Chieftains, Seán recorded several solo albums that were much admired: Gusty’s Frolicks (1975, re-released in 2000), Seán Keane (1982) and Jig it in Style (1990), as well as a duo album with a fellow Chieftain, Matt Molloy (Contentment is Wealth, 1985), and a trio album with Molloy and Liam O’Flynn (The Fire Aflame, 1992). Marie (nee Conneally), died in 2020. He is survived by their three children, Darach, Páraic and Déirdre, and by James. • Seán Keane, musician, born 12 July 1946; died 7 May 2023"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/uk-arms-sales-reach-record-85bn-as-global-tensions-escalate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:34:37Z","webTitle":"UK arms sales reach record £8.5bn as global tensions escalate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/uk-arms-sales-reach-record-85bn-as-global-tensions-escalate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/uk-arms-sales-reach-record-85bn-as-global-tensions-escalate","fields":{"headline":"UK arms sales reach record £8.5bn as global tensions escalate","bodyText":"British arms exports doubled during 2022 to a record £8.5bn according to the only publicly available official figures, reflecting escalating geopolitical uncertainties and fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The largest destination for UK-made weaponry was Qatar, which bought £2.7bn-worth, and 54% went to countries designated as “not free” by the human rights group Freedom House. These include Saudi Arabia and Turkey, as well as Qatar. The £8.5bn recorded in 2022 is comfortably a record since the UK began publishing export data in 2008, and is more than double the £4.1bn recorded in 2021. The previous high was £6.9bn in 2015, a time when Syria had collapsed into civil war. “The latest export licence figures for 2022 show that the UK arms industry is working overtime to arm some of the world’s most authoritarian regimes,” said Sam Perlo-Freeman, a researcher at Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), “as well as countries engaged in armed conflict, with the UK government’s full approval.” The two largest arms buyers were in the Gulf. Qatar bought £2.4bn worth of Eurofighter Typhoons and related equipment from BAE Systems during 2022, the first of which was delivered last August, a few months before the winter World Cup. Saudi Arabia, traditionally the UK’s most significant customer, bought £1.1bn of UK arms, including £964m of missiles and related components, arms of the type used previously by its air force to conduct bombing missions in Yemen. Arms sales to Saudi of weapons that could have been used in Yemen were briefly halted by the UK after a successful legal challenge brought by CAAT. The decision to resume is being challenged in the courts by the campaign group. The Saudi-led coalition that first intervened in the war in Yemen in 2015 is accused of repeatedly bombing, killing and injuring civilians, using aircraft and guided missiles supplied by countries including the UK. At least 87 civilians were killed by airstrikes from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen using weapons supplied by the UK and US between January 2021 and February 2022, according to an analysis by Oxfam. Air raids, however, halted in March 2022. Ukraine itself received £401m-worth of exports, although most of the £2.3bn of weapons the UK supplied to Kyiv in 2022 were from stocks held by the British military, and so did not require an export licence. Export figures are based on an analysis of official data released by the Department of Business and Trade produced by CAAT. The other two leading destinations for arms were the US (£860m) and Turkey (£424m). Even so, the true level of weapons exports is far greater because the value of a large proportion of UK arms sales is not counted up. Only the value of single-use export licences is publicly released, while broader open-export licences, including much of the UK’s exports to Saudi Arabia, are not quantified. The UK government says it takes its arms-licensing responsibilities seriously, considering applications against “a strict risk assessment framework”. It has sought to defend continuing sales to Saudi by saying that there is not a “clear risk” that war crimes – which include the targeting of civilians - could result from use of the weapons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/21/brighton-southampton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:26:44Z","webTitle":"Brighton seal historic European spot as Ferguson double sinks Southampton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/brighton-southampton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/21/brighton-southampton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Brighton seal historic European spot as Ferguson double sinks Southampton","bodyText":"Roberto De Zerbi’s message to the fans was brief. Brighton had qualified for Europe for the first time in their history and were completing a lap of honour, but the Italian wasn’t satisfied. “You have been fantastic, but we need another point to play in Europa League because we want to play in Europa League, and not the Conference,” he told the crowd. “See you next year.” He will see them on Wednesday night when Brighton host the champions Manchester City and, barring enormous swings of goal difference, the Europa League is already guaranteed. But if De Zerbi is to continue his odyssey with the Seagulls next season and continue to demand the highest from his players, then the denizens of Sussex could be forgiven for being excited. This was a nervy contest, decided by Pascal Gross’s low shot in the 69th minute. For a time Rubén Sellés’s doomed Saints actually imposed themselves effectively on the match, denying Brighton their characteristic flamboyant possession and looking dangerous on the counter. But this game was all about the result and the validation and anticipation it provides. Brighton are going places, but they have also arrived; the long journey from lower league to established Premier League side is complete. No doubt there will be turmoil ahead – largely during the summer transfer window when half their squad will surely be the subject of enquiries or offers. And as poor Southampton have proved, you are only ever as “established” as your league position allows. But Brighton have the infrastructure, the players and, no doubt, the manager to take on opponents at any level without fear. That is a lesson that does not seem to need spelling out to Evan Ferguson. The teenage striker scored two accomplished goals, full of sang-froid while many appeared to be on edge. His first was a brutish effort that mugged Lyanco and smashed past Alex McCarthy; his second, a placed finish off an expert Kaoru Mitoma cross. If you squint there is a Shearer-esque quality to his game and already he is tipped for clubs at the very top. Yet six months ago no one had heard of him, and you could say the same for Julio Enciso or Facundo Buonanotte, who shared Brighton’s right-hand side here. Stretch the period to 12 months and there’s Mitoma or Moisés Caicedo, with even Alexis Mac Allister only faintly on the radar. This squad is stacked with talent who appear able to step instantly on to the most demanding stage in league football. They surely can’t lose them all this summer, and who knows who might be next on the production line. That Gross should be the man to decide the game was apt, the German playing utility man under De Zerbi but a key figure in the success of the Seagulls in the top flight. He took a flicked-on corner from Pervis Estupiñán (oh yes, another previously anonymous elite talent), controlled it inside the box, cut inside his man and almost rolled the ball beyond a laggardly McCarthy dive. Thus a brief Southampton comeback during which Mohamed Elyounoussi flicked in a James Ward-Prowse corner and Theo Walcott’s goal was ruled out by VAR for a marginal (and perhaps typical) offside, was brought to an end. Sellés revealed he had had no interaction with his bosses over his future, despite the apparently imminent arrival of Russell Martin as the new head coach at St Mary’s. Sellés has obviously relished his brief time in the Premier League bear pit, a tactician who has enjoyed pitting his wits against more garlanded coaches, including De Zerbi whom he described as “one of the best in the world when you talk about possession”. Speaking after his tour of the Amex Stadium – “There’s a celebration out there … I don’t know why” – De Zerbi confessed the target within the dressing room had in fact been the Champions League. But his main message was for next season and the need to keep pushing. “I spoke with Tony Bloom,” De Zerbi said. “He is very happy, he is the first fan of Brighton, but now we have to organise. Now is the crucial moment for the club because we have to keep this level,” he said. “Victory can be dangerous. The history of the Premier League shows that the day before you achieve Europe and the next year you can find yourself in the bottom of the table. “Tony knows very well my idea. For me it’s an honour to work here and to continue to work here. I have never thought to change team, to go back to Italy or another Premier League club. I want to stay. I don’t know how many years, but it’s an honour, it’s a pleasure to work with these people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/21/kansas-city-missouri-nightclub-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:19:11Z","webTitle":"Three people killed and two wounded at Kansas City nightclub shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/21/kansas-city-missouri-nightclub-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/21/kansas-city-missouri-nightclub-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Three people killed and two wounded at Kansas City nightclub shooting","bodyText":"Three people were killed and two more were wounded in a shooting at a Missouri nightclub early Sunday, marking one of at least three mass shootings in the US this weekend. The killings at the Klymax Lounge in Kansas City, Missouri, and a separate shooting in Birmingham, Alabama, helped bring the number of mass shootings in the US so far this year to about 230, data from the Gun Violence Archive shows. Authorities did not immediately publicly release the names of the victims in the Kansas City shooting. However, on social media, friends of one Jason McConnell identified him as one of the victims. McConnell’s stepdaughter, Honystye Chancellor, told the Guardian on Sunday that her stepfather was a caring person and was well-loved in the community. “Almost everybody in Kansas City knew him,” she said. “He treated everybody [well].” She added: “He liked to dress – he could dress really good.” In the Alabama shooting, which happened at about the same time as the shooting in Kansas City, four people were wounded outside a bar. The shooting in Birmingham came after another shooting in that city on Friday that victimized four people at a birthday party, including one who was killed. The bloodshed comes as the US remains on track to have its deadliest year in terms of mass shootings in recent memory. The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four victims are killed or wounded, and the great number of such cases in the country has led to persistent but unheeded calls for Congress to enact meaningful gun control. The Klymax Lounge describes itself as the “newest addition to the nightlife” in Kansas City and made its first social media appearance in April 2021. From the photos on its Instagram page, it appears to regularly host live performances by musicians and other entertainers. According to police, one of those shot to death there on Sunday was found outside the club. Another was found dead inside the club, and the third died after being brought to a hospital. One of the two people wounded was in critical condition. As of midday on Sunday, Chancellor said she had not received a formal notification from authorities about McConnell’s death in the Kansas City shooting. She became aware of it at about 3am when she received numerous phone calls from friends, as word spread quickly about the shooting. She is the legal guardian of McConnell’s 15-year-old boy, the oldest among his three sons. “We just talked on Friday,” Chancellor said, when McConnell shared with her about his new job at a truck stop. He was a “jack of all trades”, she said, working many different jobs. While McConnell sometimes worked security, at the time of the shooting he was working in a different capacity and therefore did not have a protective vest that he customarily wore when the shooting erupted. The Guardian has contacted the Klymax Lounge and the Kansas City police for additional comment. In Alabama on Friday, one person died and three others were injured when someone began shooting at them at a birthday celebration in front of an apartment, Birmingham police said in a statement. One woman who was injured was not struck by any bullets but was counted as a victim because she was hurt during the attack. On Sunday, less than an hour before the Kansas City shooting, another shooting outside a bar in Birmingham wounded four people in what was described as “an exchange of gunfire”. Chancellor said she hoped authorities made it a priority to bring to justice those responsible for the weekend’s violence. “I just hope that they do what they need to do to find out who did this, not only to him but to all those other people as well,” Chancellor said. “They [were] somebody’s mom, dad, brother, sister.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/21/who-can-halt-france-oval-ball-giants-since-they-unpicked-ireland-best-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:17:44Z","webTitle":"French giants La Rochelle sent a World Cup message by unpicking Ireland’s best | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/21/who-can-halt-france-oval-ball-giants-since-they-unpicked-ireland-best-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/21/who-can-halt-france-oval-ball-giants-since-they-unpicked-ireland-best-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"French giants La Rochelle send World Cup message by unpicking Ireland’s best","bodyText":"Plenty of weighty questions will continue to hang in the Dublin air in the months ahead after the stunning Champions Cup final between La Rochelle and Leinster on Saturday. An official investigation has already been opened into a reported altercation in the tunnel at half-time but the implications of what unfolded on the field could prove even more significant in the medium term. Not only was this one of the most compelling modern rugby spectacles imaginable – up there with the thunderous second Test between the Springboks and the British &amp; Irish Lions in Pretoria in 2009 – but it also detonated a heap of received wisdom. Ireland’s best players, grand slam champions in March, have now been unpicked on their home pitch in front of their own fans less than four months before the Rugby World Cup. Meanwhile Stade Rochelais, driven on by their resident Irish guru, Ronan O’Gara, continue to elevate the game to another level in terms of power, passion and regional pride. Good luck to anyone seeking a quiet contemplative harbourside drink in La Rochelle in the coming days. As the latest raucous celebrations on the Atlantic coast unfolded, it felt reasonable to wonder how many sides anywhere could have withstood the giant yellow sledgehammer that, from 17-0 down after 12 minutes, eventually secured a 27-26 comeback triumph and a second successive Champions Cup for O’Gara’s mighty crew. Leinster were irresistible in that first quarter and yet still ended up crushed by the most formidable European force there has possibly ever been. Big is not always beautiful in rugby but it was the case here. It is not just that Will Skelton (who has now shared in three Champions Cup wins in five seasons), Jonathan Danty, Uini Atonio and Levani Botia are freaks of nature. Nor is it solely the relentless brilliance of their French No 8 Grégory Alldritt and the steel-edged running of the centre UJ Seuteni. Equally pivotal has been the competitive edge and tactical nous that O’Gara has instilled, allied to a managerial empathy that has established the 46-year-old as the smartest coach of his generation. O’Gara knew Leinster badly wanted a record-equalling fifth title but, regardless of their home-field advantage, he had other ideas. In the buildup he told his players to imagine they were setting out to climb Everest. Who, he asked them, would they most want to conquer it for? A parent, a loved one? In the team room a mat was laid out on the floor where people could place photos of their personal inspiration. The result? A team that never flinched, even when the blue whirlwind was at full intensity in the opening 40 minutes. There was also talk of disrespect from their opponents, real or imagined, and the tone was set. No one is slicker off first-phase starter plays than Leinster, as they demonstrated in that sharp early purple patch which yielded tries for Dan Sheehan (two) and Jimmy O’Brien. But their pack has been physically bullied and worn down at crucial moments in the past and here was another costly example as Danty, Seuteni and, with eight minutes left, the equally gargantuan George-Henri Colombe applied the muscular coup de grâce. It was all two or three rungs up quality-wise from the average Premiership contest and Leinster’s latest disappointment has to be seen in that relative context. But suddenly the much vaunted Leinster way has not hoisted a single trophy in two seasons and managed just one European title since 2011. While Leo Cullen is waving goodbye to the estimable Stuart Lancaster and welcoming the current Springbok coach, Jacques Nienaber, to his coaching staff, there have been too many narrow losses in big games, particularly with O’Gara in the other coaching box, for anybody’s comfort. “You can have data for everything but you don’t have data for character,” O’Gara said afterwards. Talking of character, would the outcome have been any different had a fit Johnny Sexton been available? Quite possibly, particularly given a 17-0 cushion with which to work. Leinster, one point behind with five minutes left, turned down a long-range penalty having already misjudged a couple of kicks out of hand. The 78th-minute rush of blood that led to Michael Ala’alatoa rightly being handed a red card for a shoulder to the head of Colombe was a further snapshot of Leinster’s fraying composure. Then again, Sexton is now 37 and is retiring at the end of this year anyway. His final Leinster appearance could now be at a disciplinary hearing should European Professional Club Rugby decide to take further action following a half-time bust-up near the referee’s room also allegedly involving O’Gara and other coaches and players. It may be another day or two before a further official update emerges, leaving everyone else to ponder how best to stop France’s oval-ball giants from trampling all and sundry. Worryingly for the rest of the world, there is little obvious sign of an antidote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/british-woman-missing-on-greek-island-found-dead-in-remote-area","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:16:04Z","webTitle":"British woman missing on Greek island found dead in remote area","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/british-woman-missing-on-greek-island-found-dead-in-remote-area","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/british-woman-missing-on-greek-island-found-dead-in-remote-area","fields":{"headline":"British woman missing on Greek island found dead in remote area","bodyText":"A woman who went missing on holiday on a Greek island three weeks ago has been found dead in a remote area. Susan Hart, 74, from Bath, was in Telendos with her husband, Ed, when she disappeared on 30 April. Her family said she had planned to read a book while her husband went rock climbing but then could not be found. Hart’s daughter, Ruth Landale, said her mother had been showing symptoms of dementia over the last few years but had not yet received a diagnosis. The family were heartbroken, she said, adding: “It’s been a stressful and distressing time for the whole family.” A postmortem examination is expected to take place in Greece before Hart’s body can be repatriated to Switzerland, where she was living. Hart has three daughters who grew up in Bath but now live in Canada, Australia and London with their young families. She had four grandchildren. In an appeal for information last week, her family said they felt the local police had been “obstructing” the search and the British consulate had been “pretty powerless” to help. They said the police had “lied” to them about search and rescue dogs assisting the search from the beginning – they did not arrive, she said, until nine days after Hart’s disappearance, after the family were subsequently told to arrange it themselves. Local police also claimed that specialist divers would join the search, Landale said, but three days later they were told senior officers in Athens had blocked the request. Then they were told that Hart’s family could view CCTV footage, yet later the same day her husband was “suddenly denied access and the police changed the story”, they said. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are providing consular assistance to the family of a British woman who has been reported missing in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-to-lift-stamp-duty-thresholds-for-first-home-buyers-and-undo-perrottet-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:34Z","webTitle":"NSW to lift stamp duty thresholds for first-home buyers and undo Perrottet reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-to-lift-stamp-duty-thresholds-for-first-home-buyers-and-undo-perrottet-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/nsw-to-lift-stamp-duty-thresholds-for-first-home-buyers-and-undo-perrottet-reforms","fields":{"headline":"NSW to lift stamp duty thresholds for first-home buyers and undo Perrottet reforms","bodyText":"The New South Wales government has vowed to make changes to stamp duty thresholds to allow more first home buyers to access concessions. The government says it will introduce legislation this week to increase thresholds for stamp duty concessions so that five out of six first home buyers pay a reduced rate or no stamp duty. Changes to the first home buyers assistance scheme will mean properties worth up to $800,000 will be exempt from stamp duty, lifting it from $650,000. Concessions will apply to properties worth up to $1m, up from $800,000. The government says that 84% of first home buyers will pay no stamp duty or a reduced rate under the reforms. According to the NSW government, a first home buyer purchasing an $800,000 property will save up to $31,090 under the changes. “I understand the stress of trying to purchase your first home. I want more singles, couples and families realising this dream,” premier Chris Minns said. “This is a fairer and simpler system to ensure more first home buyers have a chance of owning their first property.” Legislation passed in November by the former Coalition state government allowed first home buyers of properties worth up to $1.5m to choose to pay annual land tax instead of paying upfront stamp duty. Labor opposed the scheme – describing it as a “forever tax on your home” – and had vowed to scrap it. The new government says it will introduce legislation this week to do so. Access to the former government’s scheme will be closed off on 1 July when the new stamp duty rules come into force. The government says its new legislation will also place tighter scrutiny around first home buyer concessions, by adding an eligibility requirement that purchasers live in the home for at least a year. The previous requirement was for buyers to live in the property for six months. The treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said the move delivers a key election commitment. “This policy will deliver the most help to the first home buyers most at risk of leaving the housing market altogether as interest rates go up. “Now five out of every six first home buyers will get help to own the roof over their heads. It will benefit more first home buyers overall and more fairly goes to those who need it most. “The new thresholds for stamp duty exemptions and concessions are a simpler and fairer way to help more first home buyers than the property tax, which helped a smaller cohort of first home buyers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2023/may/22/essendons-total-control-trumps-richmonds-beautiful-chaos-in-afl-dreamtime-boilover","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:34Z","webTitle":"Essendon’s total control trumps Richmond’s beautiful chaos in AFL Dreamtime boilover | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/22/essendons-total-control-trumps-richmonds-beautiful-chaos-in-afl-dreamtime-boilover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/may/22/essendons-total-control-trumps-richmonds-beautiful-chaos-in-afl-dreamtime-boilover","fields":{"headline":"Essendon’s total control trumps Richmond’s beautiful chaos in AFL Dreamtime boilover","bodyText":"Football is constantly lurching from the sublime to the farcical and the execrable. The Sir Doug Nicholls Round was no exception. Like the man it honoured – a boxer, footballer, professional sprinter, Minister, social worker, Governor and leader of his people – the round contained multitudes. From the riveting (Collingwood), to the rickety (Carlton) and wretched (West Coast), this round had the lot. You have to suspend disbelief as a football fan sometimes. An hour after a coach who denies an accusation of pressuring a First Nations couple to terminate a pregnancy stepped down, the league endorsed a voice to parliament. A few days later, the same coach was given a round of applause at the 23rd minute mark of the first quarter. A few hours later, his team was denied its tenth win in three years because of an interchange infringement. Later that night, Aboriginal children and elders were dancing with champion footballers. At the same ground, four-time premiership coach Kevin Sheedy was belting out Archie Roach songs to 80,000 people, while a knucklehead allegedly glassed a spectator in the MCG’s Legends Room. And then, right at the death, Essendon ended a losing streak stretching back to 2014. “I will never understand what Essendon fans have gone through over the last decade,” Essendon coach Brad Scott said following Saturday night’s Dreamtime match. Ever since Stephen Dank waddled into Windy Hill, nothing’s gone right for the Bombers. This year offered a clean slate – a new coach, captain, president, CEO, gameplan and hope. But Scott was upfront right from the beginning. There would be no quick fix. They’d need to learn how to defend. There were years of bad habits to unlearn. Scott has had some rotten luck. Injuries have hit Essendon hard. Their willing but undersized defenders have been monstered by some of the bigger key forwards. Yet, early in the 2023 season, Essendon put on a brave show against three of the outstanding teams of the competition – Collingwood, Port Adelaide and Brisbane. The system was in place. The effort was undeniable. They just needed a win. Wins against Richmond had become a distant memory for Essendon. The Tigers have handled the Bombers with contempt for a decade, with 13 wins on the trot, eight of them Dreamtime games with an average winning margin of five goals. To rub it in, the yellow and blacks had returned to form. Those long Richmond possession chains, that Richmond energy, that Richmond swagger – it was all on show a week ago. Right from the beginning, the Dreamtime match was a contrast of styles. The Tigers poke it, thump it, hoik it, scrub it, scunge it – just get the effin’ thing moving forward seems to be the basic policy. Essendon sought to control the ball. They had 154 marks, the most of any team this year. The chipped. They intercepted. They played slow. It’s a brave approach against Richmond – Brad’s twin brother Chris tried it for years to no avail. And all night, the Bombers seemed destined to come up a goal or two short. But even when Richmond edged ahead, the Bombers maintained their shape and tempo – and their heads. Zach Merrett was pivotal. Earlier this year, he was the subject of a highly caffeinated piece that implored him to play ‘unhinged’ football. “In Merrett they have a fighter, a prick if you like,” the column wound up. “In Merrett, the Bombers get an open book. A bit of killer Kohli and relentless Kobe.” But Merrett isn’t Ron Andrews. He isn’t Dean Wallis. He’s a very good footballer who carried a young, emerging midfield and dragged them across the line. There was nothing unhinged about his game. All night, he made neat little incisions. He used the ball well. He absorbed the mayhem of Richmond’s game, and the weight of their midfield talent, and exited the MCG carrying a glass sculptured boomerang as best afield. Jake Stringer is a very different footballer to Merrett, but he too had a role to play. There are footballers you can set your watch to and footballers you can build a club around. Stringer is not one of those footballers. That’s not a personal attack. He’s a burster, not a grinder. He only had half a dozen touches to three-quarter time, but he exploded into action in the final term. In a team that’s all about control and process, Stringer brought some much-needed unpredictability. Tigers coach Damian Hardwick was filthy afterwards, and he had every right to be. They had a stack of inside-50s, but so many of them were dump-and-hopes. They made some bad errors in the dying minutes. And they just can’t win close games. Of a dozen matches decided by a goal or less, they haven’t won any of them. “It was a horrible game by us,” Hardwick said. He looked as frustrated as he has all year. Control had trumped chaos, and pandemonium had ensued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/high-stakes-for-victorian-treaty-umpire-as-negotiations-between-first-nations-and-government-loom","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:33Z","webTitle":"High stakes for Victorian treaty umpire as negotiations between First Nations and government loom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/high-stakes-for-victorian-treaty-umpire-as-negotiations-between-first-nations-and-government-loom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/high-stakes-for-victorian-treaty-umpire-as-negotiations-between-first-nations-and-government-loom","fields":{"headline":"High stakes for Victorian treaty umpire as negotiations between First Nations and government loom","bodyText":"Jill Gallagher had the eyes of the nation on her as she spearheaded Victoria’s landmark treaty process. But even Gallagher, the former head of the state’s treaty advancement commission, admits she would hate to “go up against the state government with all their negotiators”. As Victoria begins nation-leading treaty negotiations this year, a new body will be formed to help create an even playing field between First Nations people and the government. The Treaty Authority will act as an independent umpire to facilitate discussions and resolve disputes between the state and the First Peoples’ Assembly. Anything is on the table during treaty talks, with floated ideas including reserved Indigenous seats in parliament – similar to New Zealand – and interest-free housing loans. Gallagher holds high hopes for the Treaty Authority – the first of its kind in Australia. “It ensures that the Aboriginal community won’t get dudded in this [treaty] process, so the authority could help,” she said. “A small clan negotiating around the table with government could get hoodwinked.” Victoria’s treaty process draws on models used in Canada and New Zealand. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, a treaty commission plays a similar umpire role to facilitate treaty discussions. The authority will be created this year, with an independent panel to appoint five First Nations members following a public call for nominations. Victorian legislation states the authority may “sue and be sued”. But the authority is designed to ward off litigation, in an attempt to prevent repeating the adversarial native title process where traditional owners are required to sue the government. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Former Aboriginal affairs minister Richard Wynne will sit on the panel to select the authority. He praised the government for the “fantastic” move of relinquishing control to the independent body. “That is completely respectful of the principles of self-determination,” he said. Wynne said calls for greater protections of natural resources could be on the treaty table, pointing to the safeguards against overdevelopment along the Yarra River the Andrews government approved in 2020 while he was planning minister. “There will be similar conversations to be heard about understanding just how important these river networks are to traditional owner groups,” he said. Fellow panel member Eddie Cubillo, an associate dean and director of the Melbourne Law School’s Indigenous Law and Justice Hub, said it was vital First Nations people had confidence in the authority. “It needs to understand the culture and the laws of the people they are representing and be able to get past some of the colonial constructs that have restricted all of us in this country,” the Larrakia, Wadjigan and Central Arrente man said. Other panel members include Vicki Clark, a Wemba Wamba elder; Gunditjmara-Kirrae Whurrong man Marcus Clarke, the chief executive of Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation; and Karinda Taylor, a Wamba Wamba woman and chief executive of First Peoples’ Health and Wellbeing. The authority will be guided by First People’s law, culture and lore. It will help resolve any disputes between traditional owner groups that could arise over contested land. It will be independent from the government, with its funding shielded from election-cycle fluctuations. The authority members will be appointed in the second half of the year. Victoria is the furthest progressed jurisdiction in enacting the voice, truth and treaty elements of the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart manifesto. Elections are currently under way for the First People’s Assembly, who will represent Aboriginal people in negotiations, with voting closing on 3 June. Along with the state-wide treaty, traditional owner groups will also be able to negotiate separate treaties with the state government for issues relevant to specific regions of the state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/vape-ban-australia-2023-will-government-banning-youth-teen-vaping-vapes-work","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:33Z","webTitle":"Australia wants to be the first to turn youth vaping rates around – but will its plan work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/vape-ban-australia-2023-will-government-banning-youth-teen-vaping-vapes-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/vape-ban-australia-2023-will-government-banning-youth-teen-vaping-vapes-work","fields":{"headline":"Australia wants to be the first to turn youth vaping rates around – but will its plan work?","bodyText":"If the Australian government’s plan to ban recreational vaping – particularly among teenagers – succeeds, there won’t be any more sales of disposable vapes at corner stores, no flavours, no branding or colourful packaging. In fact, the only place where it will be legal to buy one will be at a pharmacy, and even then it will require a prescription. But the big unanswered question is will this bold scheme work? “No jurisdiction or country has yet been able to meaningfully reduce youth vaping rates once it has reached popular use,” says Becky Freeman, a professor of public health and tobacco control expert with the University of Sydney. Some regions have been successful in preventing rapid youth uptake or keeping youth uptake low, such as China (though China exports them, including to Australia) and Brazil, where all vaping products are banned, including for those who want to quit smoking. Freeman says this is why Australia has needed to take the prescription route, so those who want to use vapes to quit smoking can do so, combined with stronger regulation and enforcement that aims to prevent others, particularly children, from using them. There’s not a lot of data around yet on how regulation affects e-cigarette use, because it’s all relatively new. However, in the US, laws introduced in 2021 in a bid to tackle youth vaping required any seller to register and to enforce more stringent age verification requirements. It followed a US ban on Juul’s flavoured vaping products in 2019. While US youth vaping rates appeared to be plateauing, 2022 data reveals that rates are once again back to pre-Covid pandemic levels. “Juul sales did dramatically reduce, however other companies stepped in, such as Puff Bar … and filled the void,” Freeman says. She says unlike for cigarettes, where comprehensive education and reform has been in place for decades, the same cannot be said about efforts to reduce vaping. And while the health messages about tobacco smoking “have long been unambiguous, the clarity and consistency of messaging about vaping harms is lacking and misinformation is rife”. For example, the now debunked claim that vaping is “95% safer” than smoking is still often cited. Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast Freeman says for reform to work to reduce youth vaping, the Australian government needs to tackle the importation. “The importation reform cuts the problem off at the source.” Currently, Australians need a prescription to legally access nicotine e‑cigarette products. But manufacturers have been falsely labelling products as nicotine-free. The Australian Border Force (ABF) does not have powers to immediately seize and destroy suspected nicotine vaping products. The ABF instead alerts the drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which then tests the products for nicotine. It is time-consuming and diverts ABF officers from priorities such as firearms, drugs and child sexual abuse material. If the products are found to contain nicotine, destruction is complicated and expensive due to the high levels of plastic and numerous chemicals they contain. The co-chief executive of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health, Laura Hunter, has been in discussions with the ABF since the vaping reforms were announced to better understand how and if they will work. She says the ABF feels more confident in enforcement because the reforms will give officers the authority and resourcing to immediately trash any vaping products detected, including those bought online. “Once the reforms are legislated, ABF’s role will be a simple matter of distinguishing what has a prescription and what doesn’t,” Hunter says. Guardian Australia understands that all packages from target countries will be scanned, and any detected vape packages immediately disposed of if they do not have an accompanying authorisation for pharmacy use. However, the details of the reforms and any new legislation required are yet to be finalised. This lack of detail makes it difficult to know whether the reforms will work, according to Associate Prof Ryan Courtney, lead of the tobacco research group at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre. For example, it may not stop recreational users or dealers from receiving illegal vapes they order online, while on the other hand it may encourage recreational vape users towards getting quit advice and a legal prescription, or drive vapers to the black market. It’s difficult to gauge. Courtney, who conducts tobacco cessation research, says “we’re in uncharted waters” in that a prescription is being provided for a product that does not have drug regulator approval from the TGA or equivalent drugs regulators worldwide. “Why would any regulator approve and register a product known to be harmful?” he says. “We know there are toxins in vapes you don’t want in your lungs, and yes, they’re probably much less harmful than cigarettes. But a regulator will compare these vape products, which have the risk of explosion and toxins, to approved products such as an asthma puffer, for example, or other nicotine replacement therapies. And when you compare a vaping product to the risk profile of these products, the vaping risk is so much higher and no one is going to regulate it. “Yet consumers in Australia can get a script for vapes, which does send a bit of a confusing message.” He says while vaping is “not going to be a gamechanger” when it comes to smoking cessation, it will help a small percentage of people. “There are other frontline treatments that should be recommended first,” he says. “There’s a lot of regulation and laws that need to be written in terms of how the policy is going to be enforced related to sales that are illegal and strike a balance allowing access for those who want to quit, and until we see the detail, it’s hard to know if the reforms will stop recreational and illegal access.” Prof Emily Banks, a physician and world-leading tobacco-control expert with the Australian National University, says key to whether the reforms work will be whether children find vapes easy to find after they are introduced. “The problem we’ve got in Australia is that four-fifths of kids are saying that it’s easy to access vapes,” she says. “They’re getting them from their friends. They’re getting them from the service station, they’re getting them from the convenience store. The idea here isn’t that you could ever completely eradicate the black market or stop people ever getting things online, but it’s taking it from a 13-year-old finding it easy to access an illegal product to it no longer being easy. “It isn’t going to be about complete eradication of youth use or recreational use, but much more about shifting that balance from the current situation where we’ve got, where teachers are saying it’s their number one behavioural issue in schools, to it being a product much more targeted to adults who are using it to quit smoking.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/can-we-still-handle-the-truth-journalism-alternative-facts-and-the-rise-of-ai","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:33Z","webTitle":"Can we still handle the truth?

Journalism, ‘alternative facts’ and the rise of AI","bodyText":"We all have moments in life when we know something big is happening, that we are stepping into a new and consequential experience, and our mind takes a mental Polaroid, an intensely clear snapshot of what that moment looks like and how it feels, and then stores it away in a file marked “important”. Well, my mind does anyway, and in my professional life so far there have been three. It’s late 1987. I’m nearing the end of a cadetship at the Canberra Times and it is finally my turn to work in the newspaper’s press gallery bureau at Old Parliament House. I had chosen the Canberra Times over other opportunities because I figured it would be the fastest path to being a political reporter, the only kind of reporting I was really interested in; and here I was, on a sunny spring morning, walking past the roses and straight in the front door of that white building I’d seen every night on the news, because I worked there. I had to pause to calm my nerves. All I could think was: “Now I can start.” It was more than a decade after Watergate, but like most reporters of my generation that investigation was an already mythologised touchstone for the power of journalism to effect change. I absorbed that quote from Woodward and Bernstein: “All good reporting is the same thing – the best obtainable version of the truth.” From the starry-eyed perspective of an excited cadet, that idea seemed simple. Over the next 36 years, I came to understand how slippery and difficult it could be. As the waves of financial and technological change battered and shifted how and what we did, when the very concept of truth as the foundation of public debate was challenged, achieving the best obtainable version of the truth became very complicated indeed. Journalism, balance and truth In the late 1980s, the news cycle still moved with the sun. Papers dropped on the lawn in the morning and we had until the evening to file news for the following day. There was more time to ask questions and talk to contacts. More time to think. And as we all know, in those days, the media held a near monopoly on the attention of readers, a commodity that ensured those “rivers of gold” in advertising revenue kept flowing. This manageable tempo made it easier to find and test information, but the gatekeeping role also conferred on publishers considerable power to shape public opinion and determine which ideas, and whose ideas, got to be heard, how the obtainable version of the truth was portrayed and framed. News could be angled to suit the commercial or ideological interests of owners or toned down to ensure no advertisers complained. All the big mastheads in Australia held that traditional gatekeeping power, but it was wielded most overtly by News Corporation, an organisation I had joined as a junior reporter in 1989. As successive governments approved mergers that steadily reduced the number of publishers and increased concentration in media ownership over the ensuing decades, urged on by the editorial columns of some of those same papers, concern that power was being exercised in a way that harmed Australia’s democracy eventually grew to the point that more than 1 million Australians signed a petition supported by two former prime ministers, from opposing parties, calling for a royal commission. But that’s all to come. Then, as now, there were diligent reporters at the Australian working hard and breaking news, and then, as now, it took an editorial view on issues and politics, as it is entitled to. But, as has been extensively traversed over the years, including in Robert Manne’s 2011 Quarterly essay Bad News, the exercise of power did at times appear to override the truth. The organisation’s coverage of global heating is an obvious example. It highlighted the views of climate sceptics long after the science was clear and those views were discredited, fomenting doubt and confusion to back an editorial position often in favour of Australia delaying effective domestic action, a goal that sadly, it helped to achieve. The positioning became too much even for James Murdoch at the height of the 2020 bushfire crisis, when he and his wife, Kathryn, released a statement saying they were “particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary”. The power of publishers to influence the news was of course not a new phenomenon. As evidenced by the Guardian’s reckoning with the connections of its founders with enslavement through their commercial ties to the cotton trade, it had long been the case. In the 1800s, the Manchester Guardian’s editorial columns deplored the existence of slavery in the US, but then failed to support prescriptions to end it. As the global editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote in our editorial series on the issue “Cotton Capital”, it is “difficult to avoid the conclusion that the commercial interests of the founders may have influenced the paper’s editorial policy”. The establishment of the Scott Trust in 1936 as the Guardian’s sole shareholder has protected our editorial independence since that time. Coming back to Australia in the 1990s – press gallery bureaus were big enough for reporters to have specialist rounds and there was healthy competition for quite detailed policy coverage across all mastheads. But over time, I also saw how some senior reporters sacrificed fully scrutinised assessments for easy exclusives from politicians with whom they were close. When I was appointed political correspondent for the Australian in 1994, a senior press gallery colleague invited me to coffee to inform me that “they”, by which I believe he meant some of the blokes who held most of the senior roles in the press gallery, didn’t think I would cut it, because I didn’t understand how it worked. To succeed as a political correspondent you had to “do favours and be owed favours” he said, develop sources who would help you, and you them. I was, he said, far too straight down the line, too much like Michelle Grattan. I continue to admire Michelle Grattan and the many other press gallery reporters who are straight down the line. Sources and trusted relationships are necessary to do that job, but never at the expense of fairness and facts. Getting too close to sources is a danger, and not only for the politics beat. For me the unbearable pressure point came when I briefly returned to the Australian in 2009 and was assigned to cover the Copenhagen climate conference. For several days running I was asked to leave the meeting with 150 world leaders and 20,000 delegates with the fate of a global agreement to reduce emissions hanging in the balance, to travel across the city to the Copenhagen Climate Challenge. This was a gathering of a handful of climate deniers including the Australian geologist Prof Ian Plimer who said he was in Copenhagen to try to stop the world engaging in the “global collective madness”. The request, I was told, was being made in the interests of “balanced coverage”. Eventually, along with a few other Australian reporters, I went and filed a gently sassy sketch, having discovered a few old fellows drinking fruity lexia at lunchtime and talking about how the weather had seemed much hotter when they were lads. I believed, given the overwhelming heft of scientific evidence, that continuing to elevate the views of climate deniers was distortion, not balance. And yet it’s still happening. A 2022 report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found Australia’s Sky News channel has become a central source for climate science misinformation around the world. But, if we dismiss that view of balance and objectivity as an extreme example of false equivalence, what is the alternative? I fall back on the simple formula from Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel in their 2007 book, taught in most journalism schools, The Elements of Journalism. They make the case that objectivity is not something required of each journalist personally, there should be no expectation that we come to our desks devoid of all views or thoughts or opinions, but rather it is something required of the method each journalist applies in conducting their work. Objectivity means employing observable, repeatable methods of verification. It means always following the facts. Our methods have to be objective and, as far as possible, transparent to our readers. We should care deeply about where the truth lies. But we have to be clear about how we go about finding and assessing it, how we amend or change or correct a story when new information arrives or when we have got something wrong or when our assumptions are challenged. It can be elusive and we need to document the hunt. As Alan Sunderland, the journalist and former ABC executive, wrote in Meanjin in 2019, “regurgitating the views of others without assessing their factual basis is not journalism. Balancing a smart well-informed view with an ignorant ill-informed view and giving them the same weight is not journalism. Failing to care about where the truth lies is not journalism.” We all come to this task with life experiences that inform what we know and how we view the world, our gender, our background and education, our race or ethnicity, our sexual orientation, and those experiences make a newsroom richer and better able to tell stories, find sources, understand what is going on around us. I don’t want reporters to leave their true selves and experiences at home. We can’t possibly see what we need to if we are only looking at the world through the eyes of middle-class white folk. And at the moment, Guardian Australia has a way to go on that front. At the same time no view or perspective can override the facts, or result in us refusing to consider a different point of view, or not telling a story because we wish it wasn’t true or because it challenges something we believe. It can never mean we only include the sources who agree with what we think if there are reasoned alternative views. And yes, that does involve judgments on our part, which we need to be able to defend. It makes it all the more important that we never rush to pre-emptive or ill-informed judgment on social media. Truth might be hard to pin down, but it is not just what we want it to be. Shying away from stories because we wish the world was otherwise is doing the audience just as much a disservice as pulling punches to protect a friendly source. As Rosenstiel said in a 2020 Twitter thread on the issue: “If we mistake subjectivity for truth, we will have wounded an already weakened profession at a critical time. If we lose the ability to understand other points of view we will have allowed our passions to overwhelm the purpose democratic society requires of its press.” That exchange came as both the media and democratic society were changing at dizzying speed. Digital platforms were eroding the gatekeeping power of the old publishers and upending their business models. Some politicians didn’t just spin, they lied. And then they attacked the press for calling them out. They advanced “alternative facts”. Some news organisations began reporting falsehoods as facts, and then found themselves unable to stop doing it because their audience now believed so completely in the falsehoods. Attaining the best version of the truth kept getting harder. But again, I’m getting way ahead of the story. Challenging the gatekeepers It’s early 2013, almost exactly 10 years ago, as it happens. I’m sitting with Katharine Murphy on the grass beside the big pear sculptures outside the National Gallery. We’ve both been offered jobs at the soon-to-launch Guardian Australia by Katharine Viner, who was Guardian Australia’s launch editor: me as political editor and Murph as my deputy. In the UK, with its billion-pound Scott Trust and, at that stage, 190-year history, the Guardian was an institution for the ages. But Guardian Australia was a philanthropically funded experiment. I was, at the time, chief political correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald, Murph was at the Age and the then Fairfax chief executive, Greg Hywood, had told us we were mad, that the Guardian might be a good brand in some suburbs in London, but the only news brands that would ever have any clout in Australia were Fairfax and News Corp. In other words, Australia’s concentration of ownership could never be broken. We knew he might be right. It was a risk. But we had the chance to prove him wrong, and if we did we would be helping to create a new voice, and an unashamedly progressive voice; not partisan, but happy to plant a stake for the truth. In a last-ditch attempt to dissuade us from resigning, Hywood had sent an executive to Canberra to have coffee with each of us that weekend; a nice bloke who we met, one after the other, and then we regrouped there on the lawn by the pears. We each typed our resignations, counted to three and pressed send. I was attracted to the idea of a digital-only offering at a media organisation at the forefront of working out how to manage a news cycle which no longer moved with the sun, but rather changed by the minute. This was a time when we were optimistic about the possibilities of how digital journalism could help us understand our readers and learn from them. It was a time when Facebook and Twitter were useful places to get information, talk to people who would otherwise be out of our view, discuss and debate and distribute our news. We were still hopeful about this new town square, and there were good reasons to be. The media’s gatekeeping power was being challenged. Being factchecked and challenged in real time, facing competition from bloggers and startups, seemed like a potentially positive kind of shake-up. But we could see we were facing big changes. And a lot has changed. We still do benefit from interaction and challenge and ideas from readers but over time the social platforms became addictive traps. We depended on them for distribution even as the migration of eyeballs to their sites eroded our revenue base. Virality favoured the uncomplicated, the emotional and the dogmatic. Nuance seldom went viral. The logic of online interaction, the algorithms that favoured emotional extremes, the news sites that monetised clicks by feeding readers the ultimately unsatisfying sugar-hit of titillating easy consumption, it all formed a cycle, a kind of centrifugal force that pushed online debate towards ever more toxic extremes and an increasingly polarised readership. Civilised disagreement was swamped by divisiveness and anger and people entered closed-loop information systems impervious to alternative ideas. Some politicians fomented and capitalised on the whole mess and the polarisation corroded trust, that essential glue in a democracy, including trust in the press. In 2018 Trump’s erstwhile strategist explained a plan to push this democratic destruction even further. “We got elected on Drain the Swamp, Lock Her Up, Build a Wall. This was pure anger. Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls,” Steve Bannon told Bloomberg’s Michael Lewis. “The Democrats don’t matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” The news cycle was already moving too fast, already angry and partisan, but flooding the zone went further, aiming to deliberately overwhelm people with conflicting information to the point where they gave up on ever finding the truth, or turned off news altogether, or chose to blindly follow a side, a team. And once people identify with a side, once opinions become integrated into an understanding of personal belonging, they are heavily and instinctively motivated not to assess available information but rather to seek out information that supports their team view, which, on the internet, is always possible to find. I think many of us know good people who disappeared into that vortex during the traumatic years of the pandemic. And so we spin into a polarised world where there are chunks of the population that can’t tell fact from fiction, where a president can convince 40% of the population he won an election that he obviously lost, and encourage some of them to stage an insurrection. In an essay for a conference about authoritarianism and faultlines in democracy, Jelani Cobb, the dean of the Columbia journalism school, wrote: “The crisis of American democracy has been facilitated by the crises confronting American journalism. “Hindered by declining revenues, a diminished public trust, a shrinking labour force, and the emergence of a sophisticated disinformation ecosystem, the press, as the debates over the COVID vaccines and the 2020 election indicate, has had difficulty convincing many Americans of basic facts.” How do we hold on to the truth if the best obtainable version of the truth no longer forms guardrails of public debate and disagreement? How do we filter a firehose of disinformation, or factcheck a torrent of lies? These were questions I was soon going to have to deal with in an entirely new way. But again I’m jumping ahead in the story. Steering the course It’s now May 2016. A crisp clear evening, the sun just setting, and I am standing outside Parliament House, waiting for a lift. The tufty-haired gang-gang cockatoos are hanging from the nearby trees, noisily eating red berries, my proximity not deterring them at all from their feast. Katharine Viner, now the Guardian’s global editor-in-chief, calls from London to offer me the editorship of Guardian Australia. It was a call I’d been hoping for but I was momentarily overwhelmed. We were still so small and the task was so big. A few years before this, Nine Entertainment had been allowed to merge with Fairfax, concentrating the major media market even more than before, shrinking the sources of Australian news (other than us) from five to four – Nine, News Corp, Seven West Media and the ABC. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission at the time it approved the takeover acknowledged that that deal reduced competition in the market for Australian news and information, but said it did not reduce competition sufficiently to be in breach of the law because “other players, albeit smaller, now provide some degree of competitive constraint”. The first listed “other player” was us, Guardian Australia. Could we be competitive enough to make a real difference? The first challenge was financial. With the digital platforms eating away at advertising revenue we launched reader revenue, a slightly counterintuitive plan to ask readers to pay for something when they didn’t have to. It is now more than half our revenue. A few years later, the news media bargaining code also forced Google and Facebook to the negotiating table to do deals with publishers, including us, a model that jurisdictions around the world are seeking to replicate. The second challenge was how to grow. We needed more journalists and deeper expertise. Some generous philanthropy helped us bring forward expansion plans, we turned a profit and paid back the philanthropic loan that had helped us launch. We expanded a little more, and then the code helped us grow again. When we started we had about 20 editorial staff, about 40 in total including commercial and operations. Now that stands at 167. The third, and by far the trickiest, was how to steer the course. If readers were overwhelmed, perhaps some information could be framed differently, as explainers, inserts in stories to quickly give context and background, data representations, lists of the main points. If some readers, young readers for example, were never going to come to our painstakingly curated news site, then we needed to present our stories as podcasts, or insert our news into their social media feeds. When we do, they consume it. There are ongoing regulatory questions about TikTok, but with minimal resourcing we are reaching more than 2 million viewers a month with quite serious topics. Last year, for example, we had 1.5m views to an explainer about the conflict in Tigray. But how to navigate a polarised world, where we could factcheck misinformation all day and never report on the issues we consider important and where countering an untruth can help to draw attention to it. These are judgments to be made every day. But there are also reasons for hope that we might be able to hang on to fact-based debate. In Australia at least, the pandemic seemed to shock politicians out of their reflexive divisiveness and governments responded with an unusual degree of cooperation. Our job was made easier because, for the most part, Australian decision-makers followed expert advice and sidelined the shrill voices urging them to do otherwise. And readers responded to the pandemic with a seemingly insatiable need for information – they reached for the best available facts and knowledge provided by all the mainstream news sites as something solid to cling to as our former lives and plans dissolved into uncertainty. And it turns out, this more measured fact-based discourse enhanced trust in institutions. Social cohesion, as measured by the Scanlon report and trust as measured by the Reuters Digital Media report, and our own Guardian Essential poll, all rose. People reported greater trust in all institutions, including the media, although the latest reports suggest the Covid trust bump might now be waning somewhat. Meanwhile, Anthony Albanese has so far made a better fist than some of his predecessors of delivering on the promise to “change the way politics operates” by dialling down the temperature of the public debate, implementing his policies and empowering his cabinet, and the polls suggest the electorate likes this too. Voters are also responding to the kitchen-table politics template set by Cathy McGowan when she won the seat of Indi in 2013, and followed with such stunning success by the teals in 2022; they like the grassroots doorknocking campaigning of the Greens, and the community conversation strategy that was so successful in the same-sex marriage plebiscites, and is being re-employed by the yes campaign in the referendum for a First Nations voice to parliament. Perhaps calmly talking things out and respectfully discussing differences can prevail over traditional campaigning tactics if we can bypass the commercial and technological pressures incentivising division. And, as Judith Brett examined in her book From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage, Australia has a degree of inoculation from the polarisation infecting politics elsewhere by virtue of a system that compels people to at least turn up to vote. I’d add our shaky and very inadequate but still extant social safety net as another brake on the worst extremes of inequality that fuel an entirely justifiable mistrust in existing institutions and systems. Taken together, I think there is room to hope that we can hold on to factual discourse in Australia, that evidence-based policymaking has somehow re-emerged from more than a decade of leadership coups and sloganeering. AI and the tsunami of misinformation But now it’s 2023 and I can sense another Polaroid moment coming. I’m just not quite sure what it is yet. Or whether the picture will be real. Artificial intelligence, AI, is developing faster than we can keep up with it. In essence, our ability to train computers to learn in a way that imitates human knowledge and behaviour is developing exponentially. In recent months a new form of AI has captured the global imagination. Generative AI tools synthesise new content from existing content, whether that’s text, video, code, imagery or audio. They are built on Large Language Models which ingest billions of pieces of information and intellectual property from across the web, identify patterns and respond to our prompts, suggestions and questions. This gives them an incredible facility for language which is perhaps their most dazzling trick: we can talk to them and instruct them as we would another person and they talk back to us in fluid and seductive ways. Many of us would have experimented with one of those chatbots like ChatGPT (the initials stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformer). About 100 million people around the world have done so, and have been amazed at the incredible speed with which it produces highly plausible-sounding answers and boggled by the possibilities of the technology. For us in journalism there are many potential uses and some very obvious dangers. It’s an opportunity and a potential threat and it’s happening whether we like it or not, and so very fast. As a simplistic example exercise which I could factcheck very easily, I asked ChatGPT to write a profile of me. I must say it was very flattering, but it got a couple of things wrong, including my birth year, the year I started journalism, where I have worked, when I was awarded a Walkley award and what it was for, apparently I won the award for covering the Goss government’s first budget in 1995, when I have actually never covered Queensland politics and anyway the first budget was in 1990. The mistakes went on, culminating in the “fact” that in 2018 I was apparently awarded “the Press Freedom Medal by the Australian Journalists’ Association” in recognition of my “outstanding contribution to the defence of media freedom and the public’s right to know”, which would have been lovely but the AJA has not existed as a standalone entity since 1992. While I think the press council might occasionally award a similar-sounding medal, I have certainly never won it. It was all written in a highly credible emulation of real human prose. But ChatGPT is not human, it has no critical faculty and certainly no commitment to the truth. It doesn’t know what the truth is. It is basically predictive text on hyper-steroids. As Melissa Heikkilä said in the MIT technology review in February: “AI language models are notorious bullshitters, often presenting falsehoods as facts. They are excellent at predicting the next word in a sentence, but they have no knowledge of what the sentence actually means. That makes it incredibly dangerous to combine them with search, where it’s crucial to get the facts straight.” As our head of editorial innovation, Chris Moran, wrote: “The question for responsible news organisations is simple, and urgent: what can this technology do right now, and how can it benefit responsible reporting at a time when the wider information ecosystem is already under pressure from misinformation, polarisation and bad actors.” The opportunities are exciting, but as Moran says, the concerns extend beyond how the media uses ChatGTP. We are also worried about how ChatGTP and other programs use us. For example, ChatGPT provides citations to books and academic papers and articles, but some of them are also made up, including citations to nonexistent articles allegedly published by the Guardian. These fabrications are termed “hallucinations” but that really is anthropomorphising things; the computer models do not have brains that temporarily lose their grip on reality, they have no actual understanding at all. This raises obvious questions, including how we respond to the fact that these large language models are crawling the web, including all of our licensed content, without recompense, to chew it up and spit it back out in a kind of huge information terrine that may at times completely falsify our work, or provide what appears to be an alternative to our work which is in no way the best obtainable version of the truth and may well be false. Newsguard, a company that gives trust rankings to online news companies, found 49 websites that appeared to be publishing hundreds of articles a day that look like news stories but seem to have been written by AI with little or no human oversight, specifically to generate advertising revenue, complete with apparently AI-generated “about us” pages, disclaimers and copyright notices. The obvious potential is for a torrent of unreliable information that would leave Steve Bannon in the shade, vast quantities of articles, books and reviews so laced with mistakes and falsehoods that we completely lose sight of where truth lies and consumers of news and information are even more baffled and overwhelmed and potentially misinformed than they were before. As Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University’s graduate school of journalism and Guardian board member, wrote this year: “The real peril lies outside the world of instantaneous deception, which can be easily debunked, and in the area of creating both confusion and exhaustion by ‘flooding the zone’ with material that overwhelms the truth or at least drowns out more balanced perspectives. “This is all moving so fast it is more like a blur than a moment of clarity.” Through all of this it seems the need for factual, quality news is greater than ever. The flood of non-information makes the assembling and digging for facts, the critical analysis of information, the reporting of things that need to be known and would not be, but for our work, even more important than before. We do it as part of a community of readers now, open to suggestions, correction and debate, we distribute our work in different ways, and we urgently need to find new ways to distinguish it and stand by it amid the emerging tsunami of misinformation. Unlike an algorithm, we care about where the truth lies and we must make the loudest possible case for its importance. Because the principles and essence and purpose of this job are the same as when I was a baby reporter walking into Old Parliament House for the first time and I am as excited by it now as I was back then. It feels good to be able to say that after 36 years. I’m also privileged to lead a team of incredibly talented, innovative, determined and principled reporters and editors who very regularly have better ideas about how to fulfil our mission and confront these issues than I do. Which is just as well, really, because the task has become a lot more complicated than I had ever anticipated.

Treasury analysis released by Jim Chalmers’ office shows 333,000 more Australians were employed in April 2023 than in May 2022, which is more than three times the number of jobs gained in the first year of the Abbott Coalition government. The jobs growth comes on the back of Australia’s recovery from the early stages of the pandemic, which included long border closures. The recovery has also resulted in almost full employment. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a 3.7% unemployment rate in April, which is below what has previously been considered full employment under the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (Nairu) of about 4.5%. The same Treasury analysis shows 60% of jobs recorded a higher wage rise than the year before, to the March quarter. That 60% figure is almost double the pre-pandemic average of 32.5% recorded in 2019. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Treasury estimates the average full-time worker will have seen their earnings increase by $1,000 more than what would have happened under the previous government, although soaring inflation means people are still struggling to stay afloat. Chalmers says he understands more needs to be done. “More Australians in work and earning more are among the really pleasing economic outcomes over the past year,” the treasurer said. “We’re pleased wages are moving again, but we know that we need to see inflation moderate to secure real wages growth and ease the cost-of-living pressures felt by many Australians.” The employment minister, Tony Burke, who has continued to push for minimum wage workers to receive pay rises in line with inflation, said the government remained committed to its election promise of “secure jobs and better pay”. The Albanese government heads back to parliament this week, and debate on its budget bills will begin. The Coalition has signalled it will not be supporting all measures, including the modest $40-a-fortnight increase to the unemployment, Austudy and youth allowance payments, or the changes to the petroleum resource rent tax, meaning Labor will have a fight on its hands in the Senate. Burke said the staggered start dates to the measures (for example, the welfare increase is not scheduled to begin until September) means the government has some time to negotiate on what it needs passed. The Greens and independent senator David Pocock have both already given their support to the welfare changes, although may attempt to negotiate more help. But when it comes to the Fair Work Commission’s coming decision on wages, that will depend on the information at hand, Burke said. “There will be more inflation figures that come through before the final decision is made and so that’s why we do it in terms of not going backwards,” he told Sky News on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/trust-dignity-respect-the-no-interest-loans-helping-australians-get-back-on-their-feet","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:32Z","webTitle":"The no-interest loans helping Australians get back on their feet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/trust-dignity-respect-the-no-interest-loans-helping-australians-get-back-on-their-feet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/trust-dignity-respect-the-no-interest-loans-helping-australians-get-back-on-their-feet","fields":{"headline":"The no-interest loans helping Australians get back on their feet","bodyText":"Edi Spina was struggling under the weight of her Afterpay debt, having turned to the buy now, pay later product to buy groceries and cover basic expenses. “Before I knew it, there was this massive bill and I never caught up,” says Spina, 60, who had moved into social housing after a traumatic period of housing insecurity. Then her washing machine packed it in. Without the money to replace it, she sought help at a local Salvation Army branch. They told her about a scheme through which she could buy a new machine and pay the money back over 18 months at a rate that was manageable for her pension. It wasn’t rent-to-buy – or BNPL, or a payday lender – and there were no fees. It was a genuine zero-interest loan from a microfinance program that has been run by a network of charities for more than 40 years. The national no-interest loans (NILs) program was started by Good Shepherd in 1981, when the Catholic nuns who founded the charity first loaned $20,000 of their own money to members of the community. National Australia Bank jumped on board in 2003, and state and federal governments agreed to fund the background running costs, with community organisations helping to deliver the loans. The loans cannot be used for cash or debts and the money goes directly to the supplier of a product or service. For most items, including mattresses, white goods and dental and medical bills, the borrowing limit is $2,000. Bond loans can go up to $3,000; vehicles and motorised mobility aids up to $5,000. More than 350,000 of these loans have been given to low-income Australians since 2003. Over the past year, 170 not-for-profits have issued more than 36,000 loans worth nearly $60m. And the need is rising: Good Shepherd reports a 16% increase in loans from September to February compared with the same time the previous year. Dare Kavanagh, Good Shepherd’s national manager for the NILs program, said it was founded on the premise of removing the small financial barriers that stood in the way of “things working out” for people on low incomes, particularly those who have been through a difficult life event. “It’s most effective when it’s part of a bigger picture for someone,” Kavanagh says. “For example, a case manager is helping someone to get a job, or getting them re-established after a crisis like a natural disaster. Or they may have had to establish a new home after a relationship breakdown.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Jodie Rowe, a financial counsellor in Darwin, says she has worked with whole communities who have started using NILs as an alternative to BNPL, rent-to-buy or predatory lenders. “It can be a way of accessing, say, car repairs – that’s a really big one. Sometimes the mechanic wants their money upfront,” Rowe says. She says it’s an alternative for credit contract that have high fees and can start a “debt spiral”. “I’ve definitely seen, over the years, people’s situation improve because they’re using NILs instead of payday lenders,” Rowe says. “I had a client say to me it was life-changing for her, and that really resonated.” NILs have the full-throated support of Financial Counselling Australia which, along with Good Shepherd and others, has been lobbying for tighter regulation of BNPL schemes in Australia. Good Shepherd saw BNPL-related debt among its own clients increase eightfold between 2017 and 2021. In a report released in November, the charity found that “contrary to the characterisation of BNPL as a discretionary spending tool”, it was instead a “highly gendered phenomenon tied to women’s economic insecurity”, with people on low incomes using BNPL for essentials such as children’s clothing, baby products and groceries. “Concerningly, some of our practitioners report that women are accumulating unmanageable BNPL debts after fleeing family violence and needing money for basics,” the report said. Good Shepherd expanded the zero-interest loan program last August, increasing the amounts available, extending the repayment period and opening it up to anyone earning less than $70,000 annually before tax ($100,000 for someone with a partner or children) to better assist low-income workers in the cost-of-living crisis. The majority of NILs recipients are women and 26% overall are First Nations people. At any point, about 12% of NILs clients are “non-paying”, Kavanagh says. When they hit a crunch, however, clients are encouraged to get in contact and work out a plan, even if it’s just a pause in repayments or a reduction to $5 a fortnight. “Trust, dignity and respect are the absolute bedrock of the NILs program,” Kavanagh says. Spina is now on her third no-interest loan. After she paid off the washing machine, she got two sets of prescription glasses, and she has just received a new fridge. “Without the opportunity of being eligible for the loan, I don’t know what else I would have done,” she says. “You almost can’t wait to pay it off because you know you’re going to need it again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/may/22/from-exquisite-beauty-to-lingering-horror-the-secret-world-of-australias-herbarium","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:32Z","webTitle":"From exquisite beauty to lingering horror: the secret world of Australia’s herbarium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/from-exquisite-beauty-to-lingering-horror-the-secret-world-of-australias-herbarium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/22/from-exquisite-beauty-to-lingering-horror-the-secret-world-of-australias-herbarium","fields":{"headline":"From exquisite beauty to lingering horror: the secret world of Australia’s herbarium","bodyText":"At the National Herbarium of New South Wales, specimens of plant species are treated with reverence. They are kept in temperature-controlled sealed vaults, in immaculate condition, behind thick walls of rammed earth that are fire- and waterproof. These plants, after all, are precious: the information that holds the past and the future. As collections manager Hannah McPherson puts it: “They are here for all time.” When author and academic Prudence Gibson first came to the herbarium, at its old site in the Royal Botanic Garden, she was “changed”. Established in 1853, with 1.4m specimens and 8,000 more coming in each year, the collection is currently worth $280m. The sight of so many plant specimens, Gibson says, was “dizzying”. Last September, the entire collection moved to the Australian Botanic Garden in Mount Annan, where it now resides in a state-of-the-art building. It was a botanic Nirvana, and Gibson – who studies plants and art at the University of NSW – immediately fell in love. In her new book, The Plant Thieves: Secrets of the Herbarium, she writes: “It is a place of exquisite beauty and holds the seeds and secrets of future life. But it also records the violence and damage done to the earth, the trees, the plants and to the very future it promises to secure.” Displayed with each specimen at the herbarium is its Latin name, the date of collection and the collector’s name, with field notes about its location. Often handwritten, some can run to the poetic: “windswept cliffs” and “gently undulating red sands”. It’s a sterile, air-locked room designed to banish insects and mould, but it is also redolent with the smell of the Australian bush, and the stories of those collectors – explorers in harsh, inhospitable places, botanists in their boots searching for something special. “Each specimen represents a point in space and time,” McPherson explains. “For example, collections from the turn of last century from areas which are now built on. That tells us about the history of plants that we can’t see any more.” In fact, the herbarium holds 15 of the 37 species that are listed as extinct in NSW. “We interrogate the collection through time to investigate climate change impacts and what it is doing to the flora – for example, changes to flowering time.” Gibson’s book, part of a collaboration with the herbarium which received a grant from the Australian Research Council, took her on a three-year odyssey. But the genesis came from an unlikely place: a cacao ceremony and group meditation hosted by a shaman friend. “I was conscious and present but also somewhere else,” she writes; “you could say that cacao led me here, to this project with the herbarium.” It also led her into the underground world of those who cultivate and use psychoactive plants – “a group of people I didn’t expect to meet” who “opened up a whole world of mind-expanding information”. (She has tried psilocybin, but “just really small micro doses because I’m chicken shit”.) In the herbarium’s spirit collection, preserved specimens are stored in bottles “like alien creatures of horrifying nature gone wrong”, she writes. “No wonder the ghoulish among us love the herbarium so much.” It was here that she met an ophio-cordycep, also known as a zombie fungus, which – like something out of the Last of Us – attaches itself to insects and “eventually takes control of its nervous system”. The infected insect falls to the floor of the forest and burrows down; then, when the fungus is ready to reproduce, it sends the insect back up through the earth, and releases its spores as soon as it hits the air. “So it has used that bug to reproduce!” Gibson explains with relish. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “Have we colonised plants, cutting down forests, containing and constraining them?” she wonders. “Can we be so sure that the vegetable world is not more powerful? What if plants have colonised us from the start, from the beginning of time – at least western time?” The secrets of the herbarium would also take her into the “dusty stories” of early collectors, like the intrepid German Amalie Dietrich, who travelled through remote Queensland in the 1860s collecting fauna specimens – but also collected skeletons of First Nations people, which were shipped back to Germany. The story left Gibson with “a lingering horror”. Gibson has visited the secure freezer room where the earliest specimens reside, collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander in New Zealand in 1769. There are 800 specimens in the herbarium from Cook’s voyage in 1770. “They represent the landscape before we modified it,” says McPherson, somewhat diplomatically. Among them are all the Australian icons: bottlebrush, banksia, wattle, tea tree. “There’s a lot of complexity around that the naming of plants and the associated cultural knowledge,” Gibson explains. Meeting with First Nations people led her to “face the truth about colonial erasure of Indigenous knowledge about plants. We need to tell the true story as part of decolonising ourselves and our institutions. To be honest about the past.” For her research, Gibson talked to dozens of disparate plant people with “enormous depth and breadth of knowledge”. Botanists, horticulturalists, genetic researchers, conservators, traditional owners, historians, artists, poets. “I’m really interested in this concept called the aesthetics of care,” she says. “Living your life in a modality of caring for our environment means that you wake up with a different attitude to the world.” At the herbarium, McPherson opens a drawer that reveals a specimen of Pituri Deboisia Hopwoodii. She asks the Guardian not to identify where it was found. It contains nicotine alkaline, and was chewed by Indigenous Australians for its narcotic effects. With its spiky leaves it looks a bit forlorn, like a guest who has been asked to leave a party. “We mask the location if they contain drugs, poison or mind-altering substances because of poaching,” she says. With rare plants such as the Wollemi pine, “their location remains a secret even from most staff”. Not all plants are benign, Gibson writes – “they are capable of violence too, even cruelty”. She writes about the tropical Dieffenbachia, with its toxic leaves that cause muteness, pain and difficulty breathing and were used by slave owners in the West Indies to silence slaves, and by Tucana Indians in the Amazon for poison arrows. “There’s poisonous plants everywhere,” she says. At the herbarium we meet information botanist Peter Jobson, who investigates around 1,000 cases a year when “plants are causing problems”. Some have poisoned animals or people, for instance, or development applications that threaten rare species. He also identifies cannabis and poppies for the police. “You have got to be careful,” he says, “there is a whole bundle of things that look like cannabis but aren’t.” Before she started work on the book, Gibson met Gordon Guymer, director of the Queensland Herbarium – a man who, like Jobson, is often asked to give evidence in court proceedings. When Alison Baden-Clay’s body was dumped under the Colo bridge, Guymer was able to identify seven types of myrtle leaf that were in her hair, and were also found in her back garden – “so she was clearly dragged through before her death”. This became crucial evidence on which her husband was convicted of her 2012 murder. “Plants are not just an inert background to human action. They have this liveliness about them, they have this agency, this power,” Gibson says. “Everyone thinks of plants as inert and stuck in one place – until you meet the root systems and the mycelium, and you can see how plants and seeds are moved in the wind.” Delving into the secrets at the herbarium, she discovered the capacity of plants to not just move but communicate with each other; it’s information that “you can’t unknow”, she says. If more people understood plants “as if they were kin”, she believes, conservation would be easier. “Plants do relationships better than humans,” Gibson writes. “We could learn a lot from them … there’s so much more to them than we think.” The Plant Thieves: Secrets of the Herbarium by Prudence Gibson is out now through UNSW Press.

Coffee dregs stain the base of a pair of cups. Cereal bowls are stacked in the sink. The sound of my footsteps down the hallway bounce through the house and the keys clash on the drawers like a cymbal. Everyone has gone. Off to work, off to school. Except me. I work a four-day week and today is my fifth day. The day of not-work. So, what do I do now? Around the world, the four-day week is inching towards grasping distance. For many, I am living the work-life balance dream. Living in some imminent utopian future in which, in return for decades of increasing productivity for relatively little increase in pay and in light of a global epidemic of stress, the four-day work week becomes the next great shift in the way we structure work and leisure. This is OK, say economists and employers, because actually productivity does not decline when workplaces shift. And from this side of the four-day week, I report: it’s good. It really is. But it’s complicated. Because as that fifth day opens up, one starts to feel the weight of its infinite potential and the questions start to pile up. What will you achieve on that fifth day? Can you justify non-work on a weekday? Can you stop work seeping to that day? Or can I just … rest? *** Until February, I worked a four-day week to accommodate childcare. My fifth day was work – caregiving work. I didn’t view the day as “work”, not really, but assigning it that word made it easier to explain why I was avoiding work-work on that day. As my youngest child prepared to start school I was talking with a friend whose youngest child was starting school with my daughter. She too worked a four-day week. What, she asked, would I do with work? Without caregiving work to justify it, an additional day off felt somehow wrong. Selfish and unproductive. Not so long ago, being able to pursue or enjoy leisure for its own sake was a marker of your elevated place in the social hierarchy. Now our busyness, the demands on our time, writes sociologist Jonathan Gershuny, has become a key signifier of social status. Whereas in many religions periods of rest are dictated, and ancient Greek philosophers extolled leisure and freedom as key to a virtuous life, today we have come to suffer not so much from the “delusion of the love of work” described by Paul Lefargue in 1883 but rather the belief that our working selves are our definitive selves. Eighty years ago philosopher Bertrand Russell, in calling for a four-hour working day, suggested “a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the virtuousness of work”. Add nearly a century of rapid technological and social advances, and the workification of leisure, and we arrive at a point where, as writer Jenny Odell put it (in a 2017 speech which kicked off a genre about rest), “it’s possible to understand the practice of doing nothing solely as a self-indulgent luxury”. So it was with some trepidation, privilege and shame that I replied to my friend, “No. I think I’m going to keep that day.” *** In Belgium in 2019, a women’s organisation flipped its staff on to a four-day week. At the outset, the female workforce was hopeful. More than four in five wished to prioritise personal time, and 60% wanted more time with their partner and children and to live healthier. A team of researchers followed the workers, who filled in time diaries. A year after the shift, just over two in five said they felt they had more time for themselves and 25% reported feeling like they had more time with their partner. The time freed up from doing less paid work was, the study found, “mostly was spent on household work”. This is not to say that unpaid work hours made up for paid; the total working hours of these women decreased. “Employees did experience less household stress, less leisure time pressure and better work-life balance,” the report found, and that by reducing working hours the chances of work invading family life decreased. Once I decided to keep to a four-day week, what followed was a continuous mental calculus as to how that day might work. My greatest fear was that the day might disappear – in housework, like the Belgians, or somehow in a thousand tiny pieces of inconsequential busyness. I feared I would not rest, and I feared I might rest too much. I would steadfastly not work-work – take no calls, check no emails – but I could not escape the feeling that I must be accountable for that time. The idea of rest came with a spectre of guilt. A 2019 study, The Rest Test, led by psychologist and BBC radio presenter Claudia Hammond, found that for many people the prospect of resting was associated with anxiety and guilt. And so, I planned my day with precision. In the morning, as I return to an empty house, I embark on at least two hours and no more than two hours and 45 minutes of housework. It is precise. I set alarms. I mop or dust or change sheets or get to all the other tasks that otherwise consume the rest of the week. The floor gleams with accomplishment. This is my insurance against guilt. At no later than midday I stop. I have drawn a box around a time, in the middle of the day, as if by thick felt texta. This is my time. For no purpose other than my enjoyment of it. I leave the house and, from exactly 12:15pm to 1:15pm, I go to an exercise class I love. That hour cannot be broken apart or given to anyone or anything else. In this, it is rest. This is my insurance against resentment. From 1:15pm until the school day ends is an amorphous time. I haven’t quite figured out yet what to do with it or who it belongs to. My day began with 12 admin things on my to-do list, and ends with nine. I have listened to three great podcasts. At my local cafe I have read one fascinating long article and, unhurried, stared out into the middle distance without guilt. The day is not magical. But as it ends, I feel somewhat lighter. Less stressed. I feel grateful. I feel ready for work. *** Experiments in and evangelism for the four-day work week have come amid a flurry of books on time, work and rest. There is: Saving Time by Jenny Odell (a follow-up to 2019’s influential How to Do Nothing); Hanging Out: the Radical Power of Killing Time by Sheila Liming (2023); The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time by Richard Fisher (2023); Work Less, Do More (2023) by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang (a follow-up to the rest-as-productivity-hack bible Rest: Why you get more done when you work less, 2018). The overriding theme is a preoccupation with time in a society where many feel we have not enough of it. A grappling with rest and leisure in a culture which views low productivity as both an economic and individual failing. And perhaps, a fallout from a pandemic in which for many of us, time slowed, work morphed, technology marched and we had to face the question of what it is we actually value. There is an air of a movement about these books. A sense of reclaiming our “right to be lazy” – first floated by Lafargue in 1883 and largely ignored ever since – or at least freed from the need to both be productive and demonstrate that productivity. A sense of indignation, almost, at the irony that at a time of unprecedented wealth and access to leisure, so many of us feel we have neither. “We must work to seize and redistribute the wealth that is time,” writes Liming. “When we have done that, we must commit to the work of giving it all back to each other.” Demands for more time away from work have been successful in the past. Great shifts in the way we order work and leisure time. When electric lights kept shop workers labouring longer than before, the Early Closing Movement demanded a reduction to a 12-hour working day. As industrialisation increased productivity in Australia, workers ultimately achieved an eight-hour day, five-day week, claiming that more time for leisure would enable workers to improve their “social and moral condition” and be better fathers, husbands and citizens. Technology had drawn more productivity out of workers, the argument went. Now it was their right to reclaim time saved by technology for themselves. In 1932 Bertrand Russell wrote: “Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines. In this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever.” Yet here we are, in the age of the most magnificent machines. Burnt out. Are we now at a moment where our forever foolishness ends? It may not be that the four-day work week revolutionises our minds as much as it might revolutionise our schedules. It will take more than a shift in logging on and logging off times to truly disconnect ourselves from the impetus to work ever more (including, what Odell calls the “work of self-optimisation”) or from the view that leisure’s purpose is to recuperate or distract from work. But it is, perhaps, another stone on the road to the fabled promise land of work-life balance. To a place, in short, where we might see our time as ours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:31Z","webTitle":"How the Australian gas industry’s audacious net zero claims stack up – explainer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/how-the-australian-gas-industrys-audacious-net-zero-claims-stack-up-explainer","fields":{"headline":"How the Australian gas industry’s audacious net zero claims stack up – explainer","bodyText":"Fossil fuel executives gathered in Adelaide last week for a conference of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. They spent much of it making what might seem an audacious claim: that the gas industry is a solution to the climate crisis. Senior Labor and Coalition MPs turned up to lend their support, and offer to do the industry’s bidding. The head of Santos, Kevin Gallagher, argued it showed gas developers would “ultimately find ourselves on the right side of history”. What does the evidence say? Let’s look at some of the key claims made. Is gas ‘part of the solution’ and vital to reaching net zero? The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, summed up the mood at the Appea conference: “The road to net zero emissions – for Australia, the region and the world – is one we can only travel with gas.” At one level, this is just a statement of the obvious. Gas is currently relied on as an energy source. So is coal. Neither can be turned off immediately. But, just as obviously, burning these fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate crisis. Logic says we need to use as little of them as possible as soon as we can. The argument at the conference was the opposite – that the path to net zero was to open up new gas fields. Under this logic, adding vast new sources of greenhouse gas emissions is good for the climate. It’s a remarkable claim. The International Energy Agency is among those to have warned no new gas fields should be opened if the world is to meet internationally agreed climate goals. Gas proponents argue using more gas will allow a quicker move away from coal, which emits more. This is the “gas is a transition fuel” argument. They say there are cases where it has happened – in the UK, for example, where the coal industry crashed decades ago for reasons unrelated to the climate crisis and gas helped fill that breach. But these are historic arguments from a time when there were no clean alternatives. Now there are. Renewable energy – solar and wind – can be substituted for gas in many cases. Experts say the question we should be asking is: how quickly can we move away from gas? And how much gas do we need while that happens, and to meet demand for the few cases in which there is not yet a realistic alternative? The energy and climate change director at the Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, says the role of gas becomes “progressively smaller and smaller” as net zero goals get closer for a simple reason: “It’s a fossil fuel and it’s increasingly expensive.” “The role of government is to manage the transition away from gas,” he says. “It won’t be a gas-led recovery and it won’t be an easy walk in the park. Part of the solution is [for gas] to not be there anyway. The politicians have not got that narrative nailed yet.” Is gas essential to decarbonise the electricity grid? The Australian Energy Market Operator says it is likely some gas-fired power will be needed well into the future. Aemo’s integrated system plan – a blueprint for the optimal future grid – suggests “peaking” gas plants, that can be turned on and off quickly, will be needed as backup when there is less sun and wind and batteries and other forms of storage, such as pumped hydro, are stretched beyond capacity. But its forecasts suggest less gas will be burned than today. And gas power is already a bit player in the national market. What about in other industries – manufacturing, for example? Gas is an important fuel source for some manufacturing industries such as plastics, alumina and chemicals, which use it for processes that require extreme heat and as a feedstock. Solar and wind can not replace gas in these processes. The expectation is green hydrogen, made with renewable energy, may be able to. It isn’t affordable or available at scale yet. The Albanese government announced $2bn in this month’s budget to try to kickstart a renewable hydrogen industry. In the meantime, manufacturing uses a relatively small proportion of the gas extracted in Australia: about 400 petajoules a year, or 7% of the total. Electricity generation uses a similar amount. So is there a gas shortage in Australia? No. Enough gas is collected to meet demand within the country several times over. Three-quarters of it is compressed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and sold in Asia. Another 7.5% is used by the gas export industry (turning gas into LNG is an energy hungry business). But southern states do face a potential gas shortfall. This is the result of political and business decisions. Western Australia is the exception: it has a reservation policy, requiring 15% of all gas be kept for local use. The result has been no shortage and much cheaper gas than on the east coast. Will demand for gas remain as high as it is today? Forecasts suggest it won’t. In Victoria, the state most reliant on gas for household cooking and heating, and where the potential for a shortfall in coming years appears greatest, a government-appointed expert panel has recommended the fuel be “largely phased out” by 2035 as part of a plan to cut emissions by 75%. The Australian Energy Market Operator also projects a drop in use in other states. Globally, the IEA has forecast that the recent “golden age” of gas development will end by 2030 and that Australian exports will decline sharply after 2040. A three-year-long Australian study backed by industry reached a similar conclusion. The future is unwritten, but the evidence suggests companies backing new gas fields expected to run for decades shouldn’t be confident about their investment. Is gas cleaner than coal – and how does it compare to renewables? Gas advocates argue it emits about half as much CO2 as coal to create the same amount of electricity. But those numbers can be misleading as they do not count things that can make the climate impact significantly greater. They don’t include fugitive leaks of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, or CO2 released creating the energy that is used during the extraction, compression and transportation of gas. And they don’t factor in the efficiency of the power station in which the gas is ultimately burned. An inefficient gas plant can be nearly as dirty as an efficient coal plant. There is little detailed information on the genuine footprint of gas, but a decade ago one study found when LNG was exported for electricity generation it was at least 22 times dirtier than wind energy and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power. Would having more gas keep energy prices lower? Since exports opened up about a decade ago, the gas price on the Australian east coast has been pegged to the price in Asia. It made it more expensive than the alternatives: solar, wind or coal. Gas prices have jumped even higher since Russia further invaded Ukraine and European countries sought to replace Russian gas with other sources. While there is a general principle that more supply lowers prices, Tony Wood says the reverse actually applies for gas in Australia. Why? The gas that is relatively cheap to extract and sell has mostly already been accessed and most remaining fields will be more expensive to mine. Can carbon capture and storage give the industry a future? Not on current evidence. CCS was a major focus at the Appea conference. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, described CCS – capturing emissions before they go into the atmosphere and pumping them back underground – as the “single biggest opportunity for emissions reduction in the energy resources sector” and said the technology could currently capture up to 44m tonnes of CO2 a year. This claim needs some context. The 44m tonne capacity is just 0.12% of global emissions released by burning fossil fuels in 2021. CCS has had billions of dollars of government grants and subsidies committed to it, including an estimated $4bn in Australia, but the technology has not meaningfully provided emission cuts. A flagship project at Chevron’s giant Gorgon LNG development in WA, backed by $60m in government funding, has been beset with problems and missed operational targets since starting in 2016. It is still running at only one-third of its capacity, storing 1.6m tonnes last financial year while emitting 8.3m tonnes. To date, the few CCS developments in operation are mostly trying to capture CO2 that leaks as gas is extracted, and not addressing the emissions released when gas is compressed into LNG or the fuel is burned – which is where most of the pollution comes from. There is also the issue of cost. Even if gas-fired power stations fitted with CCS became the norm, it would significantly push up the price. The IEA has estimated each tonne of CO2 captured would add about US$90 to the cost of an electricity source that’s already more expensive than renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/22/victorian-government-jobs-will-be-slashed-in-state-budget-to-rein-in-covid-debt-analysts-predict","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:31Z","webTitle":"Victorian government jobs will be slashed in state budget to rein in Covid debt, analysts predict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/victorian-government-jobs-will-be-slashed-in-state-budget-to-rein-in-covid-debt-analysts-predict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/22/victorian-government-jobs-will-be-slashed-in-state-budget-to-rein-in-covid-debt-analysts-predict","fields":{"headline":"Victorian government jobs will be slashed in state budget to rein in Covid debt, analysts predict","bodyText":"Victoria’s mounting debt burden will force the Andrews government to scythe staffing levels and delay costly rail projects to avoid a further deterioration of finances, analysts predict. The state, which accounts for about a quarter of Australia’s economy, has “a very weak” budget outlook compared with other states, S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst Anthony Walker says. “Its large infrastructure program ensures the budget will remain in large cash deficit, even if the government delays major projects in [Tuesday’s] budget,” Walker said. By 2025, Victoria’s total debt is expected to hit 210% of operating revenues – or triple pre-Covid levels – when S&amp;P expects it will reach $194.2bn. John Manning, a senior analyst at Moody’s investors service, said general government debt should swell even further by 30 June 2026, to about 229% of annual revenue. “The operating deficits combined with significant levels of debt-funded capital spending are really what’s driving the state’s debt burden to very high levels,” Manning said. Prior to the pandemic, the Andrews government undertook huge borrowings to fund signature infrastructure projects, such as level crossing removals and Metro Tunnel. It then spent billions propping up the health system and supporting small businesses. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has sought to distinguish between “borrowing to build” and the Covid-19 “emergency funds”. “That makes the economy bigger, that keeps people in work, that protects our quality of life,” he said. “It’s a bit like a mortgage – it’s paid back over time and you derive a direct benefit from that. “Covid debt’s a bit more like a credit card, and we have to get that balance back down to zero.” According to the Sunday Age, Tuesday’s budget will also distinguish between the two and will include a $31.5bn plan that will work to repay Covid debt, via savings and new revenue measures. The health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, would not comment on the report on Sunday but said the budget would “deliver on each and every” election commitment. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Labor MPs have told Guardian Australia the budget will be tough but deliver a small operating surplus in the forward estimates and include initiatives to support first home buyers. Andrews said getting to a surplus will require “some challenging decisions, some difficult decisions” due to the economic climate. “As a government, we’ve always taken the view that a taxpayer deserves to be satisfied that we are placing the effort and spending resources in a way that’s responsible,” the state’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, said when asked if his ninth budget would slash jobs. “But we are definitely of the view that the provision of services to the community should not be adversely affected.” The shadow treasurer, Brad Rowswell, said the budget would reveal the government was “getting tired, getting lazy” as it began its third term. “We’re on [the] cliff’s edge of another [credit] rating’s drop,” he said. “We’re the highest-taxed state in the nation.” Taxes, net debt and interest payments are all expected to rise. David Hayward, an emeritus professor at RMIT university and chair of the Victorian government’s social housing regulation review, said the traditional pre-budget spray of announcements had been absent for “the first time I can remember”. “I think everybody here is expecting it to be tough,” he said. Several key infrastructure projects, such as the Melbourne airport rail and improvements to the Geelong rail line, have already been paused. Whether this is to allow the federal government to reassess their viability or to ease the state’s debt burden, such delays would be “a good thing” given the high cost of materials and staff at present, Hayward said. The state spent about $80bn more than it planned during the Covid lockdowns to keep the economy going, with about half of that on infrastructure, he said. With the jobless rate at 3.9% in April and down to just 1% in Geelong and Shepparton, Hayward said: “It’s the time to be winding back deficits and debts if ever there was a time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/three-things-with-kat-stewart-it-had-seen-more-domestic-action-than-any-garment-should","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T15:00:31Z","webTitle":"Three things with Kat Stewart: ‘It had seen more domestic action than any garment should’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/three-things-with-kat-stewart-it-had-seen-more-domestic-action-than-any-garment-should","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/three-things-with-kat-stewart-it-had-seen-more-domestic-action-than-any-garment-should","fields":{"headline":"Three things with Kat Stewart: ‘It had seen more domestic action than any garment should’","bodyText":"Kat Stewart is best known for her performances in two very different Australian TV shows. Her breakout role was in the first season of Underbelly, where she played gangland wife Roberta Williams with chilling excellence. Then she followed that up with seven years as Billie Proudman on Offspring. Right now, she’s four seasons into the series Five Bedrooms, but still finds time for other roles – such as her turn in the short film Victim. Whenever she’s away from her Melbourne home, the first thing the Logie winner checks is whether her accommodation has a kettle. Here, Stewart tells us why she must be close to tea-making devices at all times, as well as the stories of other important belongings. What I’d save from my house in a fire A makeup artist friend was raving about his cashmere dressing gown about eight years ago. I was pregnant at the time, not enjoying clothes and generally feeling blah, so I pounced on the website when they went on sale. He was right – there is something about being wrapped up in something so soft, forgiving, warm and luxurious. It’s cushioned countless 3am feeds and it saw me through Covid lockdowns, early starts and lots of dealing with sick kids. I had to retire the original gown late last year – it could practically stand up on its own. It had seen more domestic action than any garment should. But it has been replaced with an identical one, which I will never surrender! My most useful object My kettle. Basic, I know. But I come from a long line of tea drinkers. My mother used to drink upwards of 10 cups a day. She would always use a pot. I’m generally too lazy and use teabags, but a kettle is the first thing I check in my accommodation whenever I am working away from home. And I always pack tea. Admittedly, I have a single-shot coffee heart-starter in the morning but then it’s tea all the way. Coffee can be outsourced, but tea is personal. I need to make my own tea. I need that kettle. I’ll fire up with a strong English breakfast and then switch down to low caffeine or herbal from late afternoon. The item I most regret losing Every expensive pair of sunglasses I have ever owned. $20 ones always find their way back to me, but the beautiful, special ones? Gone. Always. I love sunglasses. They are an instant lift; they cover any tiredness and make me feel put together. I have quite pale eyes so I’m very squinty in the sun without them. I had one pair that made me feel happy and better looking whenever I’d wear them. They were a birthday present from my husband and the kids. I loved them so much I replaced the lenses when they got too scratched to wear – then I promptly lost them.

Why restaurant desserts are disappearing","bodyText":"Nothing baffles Grace Dent more than being deliberately served “stone-cold” bread and butter pudding: “It should obviously be hot. That’s what makes it soft, delicious and yielding. I’ve had that twice.” While it’s a quick, simple way for a restaurant to conclude a meal, cold bread and butter pudding is, for the Guardian restaurant critic, symptomatic of a wider issue. “Puddings are disappearing in Britain and they have been since the end of lockdown,” says Dent. “I talk about it all the time. That gorgeous moment at the end of dinner when the long list of different puddings comes out, it’s beginning to be a thing of the past.” There are restaurants that still go big on dessert, from the Ritz where crepes suzette are flambeed at your table, to chain pubs with extensive menus of profiteroles, sundaes and sponge puddings. But in modern, independent restaurants, places serving a disproportionate number of broadsheet critics and, yes, Observer Food Monthly readers, the story is different. “A reasonable choice of desserts is becoming rare,” agrees Observer restaurant critic Jay Rayner. “If I find a proper sponge pudding and a tart involving pastry, where they’ve done something beyond creaming mousses, I’m thrilled. Real pastry work: pastry shells, sponges, savarins, require precision and patience.” The days of the classic three-course menu have been over for a while. Today, a menu of 20+ sharing plates might include a maximum of four desserts, with some restaurants – given diners are likely to fill up early on savoury dishes – serving just one or two. They are drawn from an increasingly narrow field, as kitchens seek practical dessert formats: a tart case, meringues, parfaits, the ubiquitous panna cotta, which can be made to a high standard in a time-efficient manner, easily plated in-service and – by changing a filling, flavour or garnish – tweaked as the seasons change. Rather than delving into painstaking sugar work, laminated pastry or tempering chocolate, modern kitchens are more likely to serve you chocolate mousse, homemade ice-cream or arrangements of fruits, yoghurts, creams and crumbles, what Rayner wryly refers to as “a few creamy things in a bowl”. Key to this is the scarcity of pastry chefs and the salaries good ones now command. Chef Sam Grainger would love to hire one at his acclaimed Liverpool restaurant Belzan but he cannot justify the cost. “For that wage, you could have another head chef and open a couple more days,” he says. This problem has been decades in the making. Historically, pastry chefs struggled for respect. “Pastry” was often regarded as a frivolous footnote both creatively and financially, given how much take-up of dessert varied. Writing for the industry website Countertalk last year, pastry chef Taylor Sessegnon-Shakespeare suggested little has changed: “A recurring theme is being told you’re an unnecessary expense.” These days, few new restaurant kitchens include a dedicated pastry section. Financially, it makes more sense to squeeze in more tables. In turn, the level of knowledge in the industry has declined as many pastry chefs have opted out, preferring to work in patisseries, bakery-cafes or consultancy. “All the pastry chefs I know opened their own businesses during lockdown,” says Grainger. Good restaurants now have to box clever with dessert. Manchester’s Climat serves four on its menu of 26-ish sharing dishes. Be it a plum frangipane tart with creme fraiche, or a creme caramel with sauternes and golden raisins, those desserts must be achievable without, says executive chef Luke Richardson, “having one person solely dedicated to pastry”. Rather than wasting time on complicated techniques that, for Richardson, add little, he has Climat focused on nailing a smaller repertoire that reflects his “simple” tastes: “I love a good tart or ice-cream. I’m really happy with sticky toffee pudding.” Richardson is particularly proud of Climat’s choux buns. They took time to research and develop, and as they bake, “you have to juggle your day around it” (do not open that oven door, chef!). But “it looks impressive. It’s consistent. You can put whatever you want in.” “I don’t think desserts are dead,” says Richardson, but, in that emphasis on utility and reliability, they are “looking a bit different”. Across Manchester, Exhibition is a restaurant where you order from three kitchens, each of which serves one dessert. For Baratxuri chef-owner Joe Botham, this was a matter of time, space and staying authentic to his Basque-inspired menu. He sells “a ton” of burnt cheesecake but, “to do more than one dessert was a stretch”, and felt forced, stylistically. In Spain, sweet items are often eaten as snacks rather than pudding. Do not underestimate such abstract questions of taste, style and sensibility. Grainger does not relish the precision of pastry work. “I don’t have the patience,” he admits, much preferring the latitude and immediacy of savoury cooking. “There’s a finite number of chefs who like to work to absolute exacts,” he says, laughing. “Most of us just like to lash as much butter in a pan as possible.” Consequently, Belzan’s desserts are executed rigorously – recently a choice of white chocolate cremeux, ice-cream or a peanut caramel choux bun – but its primary creative focus is on savoury dishes. For Grainger, this reflects contemporary tastes. He feels feel people aren’t as interested in dessert. “At points, we’ve gone down to two and no one has said anything.” Is this a self-fulfilling prophecy? If restaurants serve fewer desserts from a familiar pool, you might expect interest to decline. But the limited statistics in this area back Grainger up. In a survey for its 2022 Food Insights report, analysts CGA found that if ordering fewer courses to save money, diners would prioritise mains, starters, then sides, with dessert trailing in fourth. There was also a marginal preference for starter over dessert among those counting calories. “Generally, I think people are eating less sweet things in restaurants,” says Chet Sharma, chef-founder at London’s BiBi. He has just employed a pastry chef (“after a sommelier, the most difficult role to fill”) because he wants the desserts on his evening tasting menu to excel. But he finds he has to serve only two desserts on his à la carte lunch menu, including a chocolate-coated kulfi lolly, like a mini-Magnum, for those who “want that little sweet kick, rather than a whole dessert”. On other menus, particularly sharing menus, the dessert’s role is less essential. “You never run in going: ‘I’m starving, send me the dessert menu,’” says Rayner. “Dessert is the part of the meal most likely not to happen.” Some diners’ habits may also be changing. Lungi Mhlanga recently opened Treats Club in east London and her specialist doughnut cafe, which shuts at 11pm, is drawing a big after-dinner crowd. “Customers will go to the restaurants first, won’t have dessert, then come to us because they know that’s what we specialise in.” Nationally, such venues are booming. These range from chains, such as Creams and Kaspa’s, geared to families and a younger, multicultural crowd, less interested in socialising around alcohol, to high-end London patisserie cafes such as Cédric Grolet at The Berkeley or Michael Kwan at Cake &amp; Flowers at the Dorchester. The latter are striving to fulfil pastry’s potential to deliver, as Sessegnon-Shakespeare describes it, “a landscape of textures and complex yet harmonious flavours”. “There’s a lot going on in pastry,” says Rayner, but it’s in stand-alone dessert bars and coffee shops. These are frequently run by pastry chefs who, rather than working long restaurant hours constrained by head chefs and dessert-averse diners, can achieve a better work-life balance and salary, plus more creative freedom, by going it alone. “Before, if you wanted to make it in food, you earned your stripes under top chefs in the traditional way. That’s changed a lot,” says Mhlanga. The 30-year-old is typical of a new breed working in the “sweet treat” market who have forged a career without ever considering working in restaurants. Ironically, Mhlanga is now talking to restaurants about collaborations – a growth area, as they seek to give their desserts a creative boost. Graham Hornigold used to run Hakkasan and its sister brands’ pastry operations worldwide. Today, as Smart Patisserie, he designs desserts and menus for various clients, and recently bought high-end event catering business Pretty Sweet, with a view to expanding into supplying hotels and restaurants. “Outsourcing,” says Hornigold, “is the only way forward that I see.” How dessert is delivered may change, but Hornigold insists: “People always want them. It’s not going away.” In this parlous moment for pudding, that message will stiffen Grace Dent’s resolve. “I’m leading the fightback,” she says. “We want something hot with a jug of custard.” Sweet spots: five great restaurants for desserts Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, Oxfordshire Raymond Blanc’s institution got a shake-up in January when Luke Selby took over as executive chef, but the 16-strong pastry section remains under the expert eye of Benoit Blin, who has been turning out magnificent chocolate creations, babas and strawberry tarts here for nearly 30 years. Quo Vadis, London W1 Jeremy Lee, who has graced the stoves at Quo Vadis since 2012, is a master of sweet things – everybody loves his puddings. If you can resist his justly famous profiteroles, try the buttermilk pudding with lemon curd and strawberry jelly, or one of his delectable almond tarts. Le Champignon Sauvage, Cheltenham The desserts at this revered two-star are highly intricate, involving unusual pairings such as blueberry and wood sorrel or mango with Thai green curry sorbet, but the disparate elements cohere beautifully on the plate. Heckfield Place, Hampshire Pastry chef Sarah Johnson worked at Chez Panisse in the US before joining Skye Gyngell’s Spring and later Gyngell’s restaurants at this delightful hotel. Johnson’s desserts – ginger cake with gooseberries and lemon cream, or honey custard tart with fried elderflower – are unshowy but perfectly judged, using the freshest ingredients. Raby Hunt, Darlington Self-taught chef James Close has been lavished with praise (and Michelin stars) since opening this Co Durham restaurant in 2009, but credit for the fabulous desserts – such as buckwheat mille-feuille with calvados and apple – goes to his pastry-chef wife Maria, who also moulds the skull-shaped chocolate petit fours.

The two journalists embraced in the darkness of the immigration detention centre. Boochani was struck by how tall Doherty was. The Guardian Australia reporter was shocked by the refugee’s frailty, his ribs visible in the moonlight. “I knew of the mental anguish being in those situations had but the physical impact on his body was extreme,” he says. “Behrouz was a really unwell man by the end of his detention.” Doherty was smuggled into the newly decommissioned centre in a fishing boat during a 2017 standoff, when hundreds of refugees – fearing they would be attacked by local residents – were refusing to leave it. Water and power had been cut, people were digging wells and there was little food or medicine. “There was a building tension something was going to break,” Doherty says. “It was confronting, being in the reality of that place.” Now close friends, the pair first made contact in 2014, soon after Doherty was appointed Guardian Australia’s immigration correspondent. “At that stage we had very little information about what was happening in offshore detention,” Doherty says. “These places were hugely secretive, no one could get there … we were just hearing absolutely nothing. “So I basically did what all journalists do – start making calls and just make another call, make another call.” That’s how Doherty obtained Boochani’s phone number – entered into his phone as “Manus contact”. At first Boochani was wary but, slowly, trust was built. “We built our friendship and relationship on respect,” Boochani says. “I say that as a refugee in that context. When you are a refugee, and you are a prisoner … there is a power imbalance. “Ben treated me as a journalist … a person who told the truth. That was very important for me.” Boochani would share small stories of procedures inside the detention centre, in text messages from a smuggled phone battling poor reception. He spoke to guards, local staff and fellow detainees, drawing on his experience as a reporter in his homeland of Kurdistan in north-western Iran. There Boochani had suffered for speaking out. On Manus he risked the same. The first story Boochani tipped off Doherty about was the discrimination faced by LGBTQ people inside the camp. Years later they discovered that the company paid millions by the Australian government to provide security at its offshore detention centres had hired a private investigator to find out Doherty’s source. “I remember having discussions with the [Guardian Australia] editors that Behrouz was not a contact,” Doherty says. “Behrouz was a journalist in that place doing the work of journalism … the most courageous act of journalism I’ve seen in my lifetime. “Someone trapped within the middle of that regime, exposing to the world how cruel that regime was … it was just incredible, and so vital, and extraordinary. I don’t think we ever would have known the reality of what happened in Manus Island without Behrouz taking the chances and risks that he did.” In February 2016 Boochani’s first Guardian Australia article was published, headlined: This is Manus Island, my prison, my torture, my humiliation. He would remain imprisoned there for three more years. The suffering he endured was well documented. He was frequently unwell, grew thin and twice faced the solitary confinement cells of the camp’s Chauka punishment wing. When Papua New Guinea’s police riot squad stormed the final holdout of defiant detainees in 2017, one of the first people they came for was Boochani. His phones were seized. By then he had established a network. He felt safer. “The world was watching us … following this story,” he says. Continuing to write, year after year, wasn’t easy. But Boochani was driven by a sense of duty, “a mission” to lay bare the system that had entrapped him. “It was an act of resistance,” he says. “In Kurdistan … resistance is life. When you write, when you fight, you feel you are still alive. “The Guardian has recorded the history of this policy, the history of this tragedy.” Doherty knew Boochani was speaking out for all the detainees on Manus. “It was so powerful to turn immigration reportage on its head to say, well, let’s talk to the people at the centre of this, let’s talk to the people who are refugees, who are asylum seekers, who are migrants,” he says. “Behrouz had this sense of mission, this sense of obligation … he would sometimes get frustrated with me when we couldn’t publish a story … He had to bear witness to this.” The offshore regime has been exposed but it continues. More than 40 people remain on Nauru, more than 80 are still in PNG. Australia’s approach to asylum seekers is still one of the most punitive in the world. But Boochani is free. Doherty remembers waiting for Boochani at Auckland airport, hours after discovering he was receiving asylum. “We were watching the video of the little plane coming in and waiting and waiting,” he says. “All the passengers came out and then the crew came out and then the pilots came out. “It’s an hour after the flight and it’s 90 minutes after the flight and it’s two hours after the flight. We had this rising dread that something had gone wrong at the very last hurdle.” Then, all by himself, with his “tiny little luggage and backpack on”, Boochani appeared. “The whole room felt like the oxygen had got sucked out of it … it was just like, ‘He’s made it, he’s safe. And he’s free,’” Doherty says. “It was this huge sense of fulfilment and kind of completion … that regime still exists, the architecture still exists, and there are still people there. But to see you walk out of that place, to see you walk free, it was an incredible moment.” To Boochani, it was emotional for different reasons. “It was the first time I could look back at all of those six years … to look at the past,” he says. “It was the first time I was very happy. “Because I survived.” To celebrate our birthday, we are holding a special evening for supporters with Guardian editors and journalists.

She had a massive chart-topping song a decade ago, gifted to her by the international music sensation Jonesy, and is now scrabbling around for work, doing private performances for stag parties and licensing her music for toilet paper ads in Holland. If you don’t remember Jane Start, that’s because she’s entirely fictional, coming from the pen of founder member of the Bangles turned novelist Susanna Hoffs in her newly released debut This Bird Has Flown. But Jane Start is at the forefront of a vanguard that includes Daisy Jones, Jane Quinn and Opal – the new stars in a women-led resurgence of the rock’n’roll novel. It’s a scene kickstarted by the publication in 2019 of Daisy Jones &amp; The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid, a novel told in interview transcript form about the meteoric rise and messy fallout of a 1970s band that bears more than a little resemblance to Fleetwood Mac. An adaptation by Amazon Prime Video this year, starring Riley Keough and Sam Claflin – with a resulting chart-topping Spotify release for the fictional band’s music – helped to fuel a new passion for the mock-rock-umentary, novels about groups and singers that never existed. And since the novel’s publication, there has been a growing tide of music-focused fiction. Dawnie Walton’s The Final Revival of Opal &amp; Nev details the career of ahead-of-her-time black punk Opal in 1970s New York, and her turbulent association with singer/songwriter Neville Charles. It was longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction last year. Mary Jane by Jessica Anya Blau is about a teenage girl who nannies for a family who are helping a world-famous rock star hide from prying eyes. The same year, 2021, saw Songs in Ursa Major by Emma Brodie, in which folk-rock star Jane Quinn begins a stormy relationship with superstar Jesse Reid, reminiscent of the 1970s Joni Mitchell-James Taylor romance. And now we have Susanna Hoffs’s Jane Start. Hoffs had a string of hits with the Bangles in the 1980s, including Walk Like an Egyptian, Eternal Flame and Manic Monday, and had released a slew of solo albums – the latest, Deep End, arriving just last month, alongside This Bird Has Flown. The novel is a romcom, with Jane meeting a charismatic but reserved British academic on a flight, but it’s also an exploration of fame and music, two subjects Los Angeles-born Hoffs knows very well. She says: “I’ve had many decades as a musician and in the music business – which are two separate things in my mind – and I thought this was an opportunity to pull back the curtain on stuff that I know. “I made Jane a one-hit wonder because, although I had a lot of success in the Bangles, I know what it feels like when you’ve had a taste of success and you try to follow it up after a decade of chart hits. So it’s about not only dealing with a moment of fame, but also dealing with what happened afterwards, the silence that can happen.” The music novel isn’t new, of course: there was Roddy Doyle’s The Commitments, Iain Banks’s Espedair Street and Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity. For music journalist and writer Laura Barton, it’s not necessarily a case of all thriller, no filler. “Whenever I hear about a novel set in the music world, I slightly recoil,” she says. “Which is undoubtedly unfair, but I think it’s incredibly hard to write about music in fiction and to set a story in a music industry setting without it appearing painfully cliched. It’s all drink and drugs and tight trousers, and the bad old record company man trying to steal your songs. Not to mention some really dreadful descriptions of actual music. “Those authors who have been convincing tend to have some actual firsthand understanding of it, such as Susanna Hoffs, or the story is more focused on ordinary people’s musical obsession – such as The Commitments or High Fidelity.” Barton has spent a lot of time interviewing musicians and works for a record label, so has insights that a lot of novelists might not. “Where writers are conjuring up characters who are rockstars or roadies or record label bosses, things can get a little wobbly or caricatured. The people involved are rarely the figures you expect them to be. It’s a fascinating world though, and rich for storytelling. “ Before Jenkins Reid’s Daisy Jones &amp; the Six, much fictional music writing was by men. Add to those mentioned above DJ Taylor’s Rock and Roll is Life: The True Story of the Helium Kids by One Who Was There and David Mitchell’s Utopia Avenue. That’s changing with the current trend, which Barton couldn’t be happier about. “That more women are writing about music, as journalists and novelists and academics, and wherever else, is wonderful,” she says. “There are so many women’s stories in this industry that have been told by men, or framed by men, or at least told from a largely male perspective.” Andreas Campomar is the publisher of Constable, an imprint of the Little, Brown group, who later this year will be putting out the debut novel by another musician – and this time it is a man: Tim Booth of the band James. Campomar says: “There does seem to have been a resurgence of the music novel, especially after Daisy Jones &amp; the Six did so well. There is something especially romantic about that late 70s LA period; those sun-drenched colours, which was done so well in the TV adaptation. It’s a perfect setting for a great love story, which is what Daisy Jones, at its heart, is. “It’s possible, or even probable, that some novelists are getting into this genre through a kind of wish-fulfilment. They’re able to act out their fantasies of being a musician or being in a band, with its attendant lifestyle, as well as the romance of being on the road,” he adds. “There’s also that aspect of these novels about fictional bands that allows the reader an insight into the music world. Daisy Jones &amp; the Six is thinly veiled Fleetwood Mac. There’s still a mystery and magic attached to the 70s Fleetwood Mac story. Novels such as this give us a perfected version of the truth as it might be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-what-are-allegations-speeding-fine-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:56:41Z","webTitle":"Suella Braverman: what are the allegations over her speeding fine?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-what-are-allegations-speeding-fine-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-what-are-allegations-speeding-fine-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Suella Braverman: what are the allegations over her speeding fine?","bodyText":"What is Suella Braverman alleged to have done wrong? The UK home secretary was caught speeding in a 50mph zone last summer – when she was attorney general – and given the option of accepting a fine and points on her licence or attending a speed awareness course. She is alleged to have asked civil servants to help her to arrange a one-to-one course, apparently to avoid the embarrassment of being recognised by fellow participants. When civil servants declined to do so, a political adviser is alleged to have stepped in to help, exploring options including her taking the course online without revealing her identity. Ultimately, Braverman opted to pay the fine. Sources close to Braverman have rejected parts of this account, claiming she merely asked civil servants for advice about how to book the course, rather than instructing them to arrange it. Why could asking civil servants to get involved be a breach of the ministerial code? The ministerial code says “ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between their public duties and their private interests”. Braverman may have breached that principle by asking civil servants to become involved in a personal matter. The clash between her public role and private life may appear all the greater, given that as home secretary she is in charge of law enforcement. Also embedded within the ministerial code are the seven “Nolan Principles”, which include selflessness and integrity. How are breaches of the ministerial code investigated? Rishi Sunak suggested at the press conference concluding the G7 summit in Japan that he considered the matter closed, as Braverman had “expressed regret for speeding, accepted the penalty and paid the fine”. But if the controversy continues, the prime minister could decide to refer the matter to his ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus (like his predecessors, Sunak has rejected calls for the adviser to be given the power to launch their own inquiries). As in the case of Nadhim Zahawi’s tax affairs, Magnus would then carry out an investigation – but the final decision about Braverman’s fate would rest with the prime minister. Has Braverman got form when it comes to ethics breaches? Yes: she resigned as home secretary in Liz Truss’s shortlived government last October after admitting that she had emailed a secret document from her personal email address to a fellow MP. With Truss’s leadership under intense pressure at the time, Braverman left with a swipe against the prime minister, saying in her resignation letter, “pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics. I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign.” Less than a week later, Braverman was reappointed to the same post by Sunak, in a move widely seen at the time as helping to shore up the support of rightwing Tories. Since her reappointment she has made a series of highly controversial interventions on migration, including using the word “invasion” to describe the arrival of refugees across the Channel. Which other ministers in Sunak’s administration have faced ethical questions? The prime minister promised to govern with “integrity, professionalism and accountability,” after the chaotic regimes of his two predecessors, Truss and Boris Johnson. But in his seven months in power he has already lost two cabinet ministers – Gavin Williamson and Dominic Raab – to bullying claims, and a third, Zahawi, to a tax scandal. Have speeding fines got MPs in trouble in the past? Yes. The then Labour MP for Peterborough Fiona Onasanya was ejected from parliament by a recall petition after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice in 2018, by lying to avoid a speeding fine. The Lib Dem minister Chris Huhne resigned from the coalition cabinet in 2012 and ultimately served time in prison over an arrangement in which his wife, Vicky Pryce, had taken speeding points on his behalf 10 years earlier. Pryce also went to jail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-road-safety-groups-hit-out-over-speeding-incident","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:54:33Z","webTitle":"Road safety groups hit out at Suella Braverman over speeding incident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-road-safety-groups-hit-out-over-speeding-incident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/suella-braverman-road-safety-groups-hit-out-over-speeding-incident","fields":{"headline":"Road safety groups hit out at Suella Braverman over speeding incident","bodyText":"Road safety campaigners have accused the UK home secretary of trying to downplay the dangers of speeding after she reportedly requested a private speed awareness course after being caught driving over the speed limit. Suella Braverman became the latest minister to be caught committing a road traffic offence when she was clocked speeding last summer when she was attorney general. According to the Sunday Times, Braverman asked officials to organise a one-to-one speed awareness course before accepting points on her driving licence when a private course was refused. News of Braverman’s offence comes after the prime minister was fined for his failure to wear a seatbelt last year. Within the last year, two of Braverman’s ministers at the Home Office were banned from driving for six months. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, was caught driving almost 30mph over the limit and the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, was caught driving while using a mobile phone. David Ward, the executive president of the Towards Zero Foundation, which campaigns to reduce road deaths across the world, said politicians were “normalising” breaches in road safety. He said: “There is a worrying trend, whether its Rishi Sunak’s failure to put on a seatbelt or now Suella Braverman, when senior politicians really ought to be setting a better example.” He added: “Going on a course in public is part of the penalty – by trying to somehow make it private, she was in effect trying to mitigate the impact. This makes it doubly complacent.” Ward, who attended a speed awareness course after breaking a roadworks limit on a motorway, said: “They are a salutary experience and very effective. Doing it in a group is part of the experience.” He pointed out that the Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry was forced to apologise after an Instagram picture taken from her car showed her speeding. He said: “It’s a problem for all political leaders. Politicians not only set the rules, they should be seen to be abiding by them. Road traffic speeds are set down to avoid deaths and serious injuries, which still remain a horrible problem. “We now have something like 27,000 deaths and serious injuries a year, which is a huge burden and misery for all the people involved, and yet we sort of normalise it.” Ward added: “Kinetic energy is what kills and injures and when it’s unleashed, it’s a very dangerous phenomenon.” He said the government accepted a UN target to halve road deaths in a decade but “there is no evidence we are getting anywhere near that”. Simon Munk, the head of campaigns at the London Cycling Campaign, said: “The police and the coroners and everyone knows that speeding is one of the most kind of dangerous forms of driving. And yet we have a senior politician essentially asking to sidestep the law. It is difficult to square that with reducing fatal road collisions. “Politicians and people in public life who hold positions of authority, particularly where they’re responsible for public safety, should be held to a higher level of probity and responsibility.” He added: “We don’t know how much she was over the limit, but if the attorney general at the time was speeding, that means driving beyond the safe limit and that’s not OK.” Munk said attending speed awareness courses with other people was part of the punishment. “Part of the benefit of speed awareness courses is that drivers have to face each other and talk about what they’ve done. If you’re on your own, you can’t do that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2023/may/21/west-ham-v-leeds-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:49:01Z","webTitle":"West Ham 3-1 Leeds: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/may/21/west-ham-v-leeds-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2023/may/21/west-ham-v-leeds-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Ham 3-1 Leeds: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining me for this Premier League match which has seen Leeds staring into the abyss of relegation. They have a lifeline with their game against Tottenham next weekend which is a must-win. An impressive second half performance from West Ham, particularly through Bowen, sees them continue their winning form. For all the action, have a read of the report: Want more football? Well you are in luck! I will be on the Manchester WSL derby and I hope to see you there, the kick-off in that one is 6.45pm. There is a game to keep up to date with before then with Manchester City v Chelsea in the Premier League, the coverage has began on that one: What are the clubs fighting for survival’s final matches? Everton host Bournemouth, Leeds are against Tottenham and Leicester host West Ham. Bill has got in touch about the relegation zone, saying: “Everton really have squeaked this, I reckon, with some last second thrilling heroics yesterday. Leeds really need a proper stomp on next weekend, but I think their needs are just too much for them.” It will be close. West Ham’s two second half goals: Leeds may have lost today but they are not relegated yet, it will come down to the final day of the season. Matthew has got in touch and has his say on Everton’s chances: “Everton haven’t got any full-backs, or a striker worth the name, which means they can’t play their preferred formation and lack even more than usual for goals. They also rank 18th for home form this season so I wouldn’t write any headline just yet.” Graeme has emailed and said: “Yes to bacon Wheat Crunchies. Yes to cheese Quavers. Yes to beef Monster Munch. Yes to Declan lifting a trophy and signing a contract extension.” You can have all the snacks, you could have Rice raising a trophy but I think a Rice contract extension is unlikely. Rice, Bowen and Lanzini may have just signed Leeds’ relegation with a superb second half for West Ham paying off. Leeds went ahead but couldn’t hold on, suffered the loss of Bamford and come away with nothing. 90 + 9 min: Leeds have a free kick in a good position, Greenwood takes it but Ogbonna heads away and there’s the full-time whistle. 90 + 9 min: I thought that was a sure goal with Paqueta making a great run but his pass to Rice doesn’t connect! 90 + 8 min: Leeds haven’t given up with Gnonto popping in another ball. But Bamford’s expression on the bench says it all, he looks close to tears. 90 + 7 min: Consolation for Leeds is that their fight for survival is not over. They will be able to battle for a place in the Premier League next weekend! 90 + 6 min: The goal stands! Leeds supporters have started to empty out of the London Stadium, Allardyce has a face of thunder. 90 + 5 min: they are checking this for offside! The corner comes good and that is the game put it bed. They take the set piece short and despite four Leeds players being there they get it in with Paqueta and Lanzini slots it home. 90 + 4 min: A great tackle from Leeds as they close out a cross from Fornals. Ahead of the corner Johnson is brought on for Ings and Mubama is on for Ings. 90 + 3 min: Leeds have a corner and Greenwood take it, the kick doesn’t find any of his teammates and Fornals clears. 90 + 2 min: There should have been a foul there as Greenwood is clearly challenged with an arm around the neck but nothing was given. Is this a fair assessment from Kevin: “Everton are going to beat Bournemouth, surely? You don’t deserve to stay up if you can’t beat them at home now they’re safe. What Leeds and Leicester do is moot now.” 90 min: Leeds have a corner and it comes to Summerville but Coufal blocks. There are seven minutes added here, plenty of time for another goal! 90 min: Emerson does well to stop a cross coming to Gnonto and West Ham counter. They get into the box and it falls to Ings, he takes one too many touches and Robles is able to get to it. 89 min: Koch receives a yellow card for a challenge and time is slowly running out for Leeds here. 88 min: Rodrigo’s shot is deflected behind for a corner! Can they get an equaliser? Not yet, Fabianski punches the threat away. 87 min: Ayling is visibly frustrated here, he is creating a lot for his side but it just isn’t coming off. Mary has emailed and said: “Everton fan sweating out relegation. Big Sam is everyone’s favourite punching bag but even though his style of Football is painfully dull there is a reason that teams reach out to him when they are in trouble.” It seems it will come down to the last day to see if Allardyce can save them! 85 min: West Ham make another change as Bowen comes off for Lanzini. And Leeds make more changes as they try and get the win here – Greenwood and Roca are on. Summerville and Aaronson have two punts at goal but they don’t come off. 83 min: Emerson takes the free kick and is it headed on but Robles collects. 83 min: Fornals makes a great run and his cross almost find Bowen. It comes to Rice more than 60 yards out and the West Ham supporters shout ‘shoot’ but the captain doesn’t bite. Rodrigo challenges Emerson and gets a yellow for it, a free kick in a great position. 81 min: Ogbonna is okay to continue and we are back underway. 80 min: A foul comes in on Ogbonna and Summerville gets a yellow for the challenge. Ogbonna needs some treatment so there is a break in play. 79 min: Ayling puts in a peach of a cross but none of his teammates make an attempt to score, Ayling puts his hands in the air with frustration. And here come West Ham once again, Kristensen comes to the rescue again. Another Hammers goal and this game is done. 77 min: Leeds have a chance as Summerville has it in the box but it gets stuck under his feet, it comes back out but the ball is over the bar. They need to produce something and something quickly. 76 min: Leeds supporters silenced, fans’ hands on their heads, they need to get behind the club now more than ever! Bowen makes a great run again and lays it off to Rice who passes to Fornals – his shot is skied after a great tackle from Ayling. 75 min: And instead of Leeds coming to life to try and save something from this, it is West Ham who keep coming. This time Bowen is ruled offside but this does not look good for Leeds. 74 min: Boos ring around the London Stadium as it takes a while to decide but the goal stands! Allardyce looks fuming, he pops a chewing gum in his mouth as his team currently coming away with this with no points. Oh my god, it is in by a whisker! It think this may be checked for offside, Ings lays it off to Bowen who scores. Leeds players arms in the air as they think he is offside. 72 min: West Ham are continuing their second half domination here and Frank has got in touch about our snack chat: “We do in fact have sunchips in the UK. They’re what we call sunbites. A personal favourite of mine.” There we go! 70 min: Fornals makes a great pass to find Ings in the box, he can’t quite get a shot away. It pings around West Ham players until Kristensen intercepts and clears. 69 min: Soucek is okay to continue but his nose looks battered. We are back in action. 68 min: The break continues as Soucek is checked over. A reminder Leeds are still in the relegation zone if this result stays as it is. 67 min: Paqueta gets a yellow card for a foul on Summerville. Soucek is down as he gets an accidental hit to the face in an aerial challenge, he is receiving treatment so there is a break in play. 65 min: Allardyce is screaming at his players to get in the box, the corner comes in and Fabianksi catches. The keeper sets them off on a counter and Summerville does really well to get back to close down Bowen’s cross. West Ham corner now is cleared away. All action! 64 min: Gnonto throws his hands in the air as he thinks Paqueta has hand balled and play continues but the referee does pull it back. McKennie’s long throw in is called upon again. It comes in and Soucek heads away for a corner! 63 min: Leeds are making changes with Harrison off for Summerville and Forshaw is off for Aaronson. I thought Harrison was having a good game, key in some of the chances. 61 min: What a save from Robles! Bowen smacks it in and Coufal has a head to it but Robles hooks it out for another corner. Emerson takes this one but it is cleared. 61 min: Robert has got in touch and said: “Leeds fan here. Three coffees in one day is fine. I’m in my third pint during this game. I recommend beer instead.” Maybe I’ll make another coffee shortly then, no beer for me as I’m on the clock! West Ham have a corner to come. 60 min: West Ham counter and they get it in the box, Ings spins to take the shot but it is blocked! The hosts so close to taking the lead there. Bowen then makes a run and takes a shot but Robles saves – the offside flag is raised regardless. 58 min: A miscommunication in the Leeds team sees a chance go begging as Harrison crosses in. Gnonto was making a great run but McKennie heads it first, a wasted chance! 58 min: Emerson is fouled and West Ham have a free kick, it is a long way out so they would have to build from deep. They take it short and in the end Kristensen does enough to disrupt the chance – he has been a crucial player for the visitors today. 56 min: Forshaw tries to clear but his pass only gives West Ham a good throw in opportunity. It sets up a good attack but Kristensen dispossess Ings. Is it too much to have three coffees in one day? I’m deliberating. 55 min: Paqueta finds Soucek but his cross isn’t found by a West Ham player. The hosts being given too much space and time on the ball now, they feel in total control. 54 min: Rodrigo makes a run and has a one-on-one chance but Fabianski saves – the offside flag is then raised. West Ham with sustained possession again, they are playing well here – Leeds not really having a good footing in this second half yet. 52 min: The foul from Gnonto sees a free kick that Bowen takes. It’s cleared initially but it comes to Paqueta whose shot is well saved by Robles. 51 min: Gnonto fouls Coufal this time, he needs to be careful – that is three successive fouls now. 50 min: Stuijk gifts a free kick in a good position for West Ham and this could set up a scoreable opportunity. Bowen takes it but Struijk heads away, quelling the threat he created. Gnonto is judged to have nudged a West Ham player, the Leeds fans not happy with the call. 48 min: Kristensen intercepts a ball meant for Ings, the defender has had a good game so far. Ayling fins Gnoto on the edge of the box but he can’t control. Gnoto then gives away possession with a foul on Bowen. 47 min: Sinclair the latest to have a take on Big Sam: “In the Bolton era, I remember his Bigness had, to my mind, constructed the most cosmopolitan of teams, a great shape that pulled the strengths out of an incredibly disparate group, and Sam knew enough to leave them space to play. It’s as if he hasn’t trusted the level of the teams he’s had since?” Back to the game and both sides are settling into this second half. We are back underway at the London Stadium. Can Leeds find their important winner? Or will West Ham seal victory on their last home game of the season? All action to come over the next 45. West Ham have made a half time change, Zouma is off for Kehrer. To keep you up to date on the WSL action if you are interested, Chelsea have beaten Arsenal 2-0. If Manchester United lose to Manchester City later today Chelsea will win their fourth successive trophy. Joe has got in touch and he is confused by my snack choice. He said: “Just catching up with the MBM after the morning dog walk. I’m sure it’s just a question of two countries separated by a common language, but what on earth are Wheat Crunchies!? Are they something like Sun Chips? Do you have those over there?!” Wheat crunchies are a crisp, hard tubes that taste like bacon. We also don’t have Sun Chips I don’t think. Here are the goals so far: I haven’t heard Ings’ name mentioned once and other people are noticing the same thing! Brian has said: “I think the Danny Ings heat map for that half needs a woolly hat, scarf and mittens.” Ron has tweeted and said: “Was Martin saying that he was a bad manager or just a bad choice *for Everton*? Distinction is relevant to this Spurs fan, because Conte - clearly an outstanding manager - proved to be the wrong choice *for us*.” I think you are right there, I misinterpreted his message. Definitely meant the worst manager for Everton, apologies all! Leeds saw survival on the horizon after Rodrigo found the back of the net but Rice cancelled it out before the break. All to play for in the second 45. 45 + 4 min: Oh my word how have Leeds not scored? Rodrigo steals the ball from Zouma and he lays it off to Gnoto who isn’t clinical and Harrison can’t finish it either! 45 + 3 min: It comes in and Koch has a head to it but Fabianski saves. 45 + 3 min: Leeds have a corner! 45 + 2 min: Leeds are still impressing as the first half clocks down, can they find a winner ahead of half-time? Kev aka Sid ha emailed and said: “Everton season ticket holder since 1974. Sam isn’t a bad manager but the style of football he coaches is turgid, monotonous, yawn inducing and dire. I went 4 games under Sam with 1 (one!) attempt on goal. Saying that, he kept us up - but I was always under the impression that football was part of the entertainment industry. If I paid £60 week to watch Shakespeare - I’d expect the actors not to mumble and play it safe with 11 of the cast behind the scenery in case they fell off the stage.” Keep the Big Sam opinions coming. 45 min: Leeds are still having promising play but they are missing the final touch. There will be four minutes added. 44 min: This has been a really good spell for Leeds but they haven’t been able to fire themselves ahead again, yet. They come again and Ayling crosses but Fabianski collects. 43 min: Leeds get it into the box but Ogbonna clears. They come again and Ayling crosses it in but Ogbonna saves West Ham once again. 41 min: Bowen takes it but Rodrigo heads away, well handled by Leeds there. 41 min: Lovely bit of play from Koch with a one-two touch in the box but West Ham swarm the threat initially. It comes back to Harrison who puts it into the box but Gnoto can’t get a shot away. West Ham counter and Fornals gets a shot but Robels saves! Corner to come. 39 min: Leeds having some good build-up play here, Harrison with good feet on the edge of the box and Forshaw gets it in but it’s cleared. 37 min: West Ham are now all over Leeds, shot after shot coming in. Leeds’ dominance has completely shrunk after the equaliser. Roger has emailed and said: “Just finished a bag of Jalapeno and Cheddar Quinoa Chips ! Seems a fitting snack for a Leeds supporter this season - I truly don’t know what is going on.” A lot of jalapeno fans reading! 36 min: McKennie’s long throw in is called upon once again but it doesn’t go to plan as West Ham pounce. Fornals gets in a great position but his shot is massively wide, Kristensen with a great block. 34 min: Confirmed, Bamford is off with a suspected hamstring injury. Gnoto is on for the number nine – a blow for Leeds as Bamford had a really good game. 34 min: It’s Rice’s best scoring record in the Premier League with that goal his fourth. Bamford looks in trouble here, he has been struggling for a while. It looks like they may be subbing him. 33 min: With that goal, Leeds slide back into relegation as things stand. Allardyce on his feet giving instructions to his players here. West Ham have built into this one nicely. West Ham being patient in their build-up after a sustained period on top. Fornals gets into the box but Leeds’ defence comes good once more. Bowen crosses in again though and Rice gets to it and it’s in! 30 min: West Ham are really going for it to find the equaliser here, they have momentum and they are taking it to Leeds. Martin has emailed and said: “As an Everton supporter it feels very cruel that we could be going down because our best PL era manager (Moyes) can’t beat one of our worst (Big Sam). Bleak!” I wouldn’t say Allardyce is a bad manager, anyone else agree? 28 min: Bowen has it in and the ball is scrambled! It comes out to Rice who takes a shot but Ayling blocks. The ball is out for another corner, it comes in and it’s scrambled again! Nervous moments for Leeds and Robles just does enough to keep it out. 27 min: Allardyce has just found a £5 note on the floor and given it back to the assistant with a chuckle, his mood much brighter with his side in front! West Ham have another corner and Bowen will take it. It comes in and Bamford heads away for another corner. 26 min: West Ham supporters shout ‘shoot’ when Rice has the ball at his feet outside the area, he takes the encouragement but it rockets over the bar. Emerson has been winded after a ball from Ayling hits him in the chest but he is okay to continue. 24 min: Bamford is down clutching his head after a foul from Zouma, he is okay to continue but he looks frustrated as the referee doesn’t give a free kick. 22 min: Ayling has a shot on target once again but this time Fabianski collects well. Tenkaykev has emailed and said: “Hoping for a Leeds win today, grandson is a Leeds supporter. On the topic of snacks, I recently rediscovered ‘Nice’n Spicy’ Nik Naks. A real trip down memory lane. They also make the most awesome topping for macaroni cheese if you run a rolling pin over the bags before sprinkling the contents, mixed with grated cheese, over the top.” I am definitely trying this now, that sounds delicious! 21 min: Bowen sends it in but no West Ham player can get a clear touch on the ball. 20 min: Leeds supporters are now in full voice and West Ham fans are trying to drown them out. A great atmosphereas West Ham come forward and Kristensen boots it into the heavens to clear. First corner to come. 18 min: A great moment for Leeds! As things stand they are out of the relegation zone. Tom has emailed and said: “On a Leeds theme, penny for the thoughts of Kalvin Phillips this morning? I felt fairly sorry for him receiving the lowest rating of anyone in the City squad reading Jamie Jackson’s rankings article this morning (but not sure you can argue with that assessment). Can also contrast with how Declan Rice’s stock has just continued to go in the opposite direction since they played together so successfully in midfield at the last Euros.” Phillips has had to deal with a long-term injury and then battle for a position in a Man City team littered with stars. What a screamer! A throw in comes into the box and Rodrigo has a one-touch finish. Allardyce’s arms into the air and fist pumps to boot. Huge moment. 16 min: McKennie gets it up to the box but it is cleared. Bowen is now down after he is clipped by Ayling. He is okay to continue and action is back underway. 15 min: Justin has got in touch and said: “When you’re down to your last two drinks in the Last Chance Saloon, it’s probably best to be sharing your peanuts with a character called Big Sam. Even if you know he’s only with you For a Few Dollars More. But one thing we know: Today and next Saturday, we’re going to see The Good, the Bad and the Ugly from Leeds. Enjoy your spaghetti, Sarah!” Very well put! I’m on the crisps at the moment but you may have inspired my dinner now! Back to the football and McKennie does well to rob Soucek. 14 min: Harrison had a chance to cross it in but West Ham do well to swarm him to prevent it. They do have a throw in though but Rice heads away. Leeds do need to convert their chances, they may not continue throughout the match. 12 min: Ayling has a shot but Fabianski again collects. Kevin has emailed and said: “Opportunity missed by Moyes- going with Ings when he could have started with Mubama.” I think he’s resting some players after the semi-final, a lot of people shocked Moyes didn’t make more changes before this one. 11 min: A great run and cross from Bowen comes in but Leeds clear – that was a great chance. West Ham are building in this one. 10 min: Another shot rains down on the West Ham goal but Fabianski calmly collects again, Leeds peppering the West Ham defence but they haven’t been clinical enough to see the result so far. West Ham counter and Koch makes a great block to deny them. Rice gets into the box but his pass doesn’t find a teammate. 8 min: Ayling crosses it in but Ogbonna clears. McKennie’s throw in is into the box but it’s cleared. Harrison leads Leeds’ attack once more and it comes back to him in the box but his shot is straight at Fabianski. 7 min: Fornals tries to find Bowen but McKennie intercepts the ball – the West Ham supporters were in full voice then! Bamford makes a great touch and run but his resulting pass is cleared by West Ham. A really good start from Bamford. 5 min: The Hammers have had a sustained period on the ball but they lose it in the midfield. Leeds boot it upfield and Bamford takes a good touch, he squares it to Rodrigo but his touch is too heavy! He would have had a clear shot on target if he controlled that. Leeds showing some hints of good play here. 4 min: The West Ham crowd have not stopped singing since the players have come out, they are still celebrating that semi-final win. Bamford, who has had to deal with a lot of abuse after his missed penalty last weekend, makes a great run but his last touch is too heavy and West Ham counter. They manage to get it on the edge of the box but Leeds clear. 2 min: The ball is in the box early for Leeds but it doesn’t quite reach Harrison and West Ham quell the danger. Leeds bang up for this, they know what a win could mean to their survival hopes. Can Leeds bag some valuable points? Or will West Ham deal them another blow to their survival hopes? We will find out soon. The players are out and Declan Rice leads West Ham carrying his son. Just a few minutes to go now! David Crowther has emailed to get in on the snack chat and it’s an interesting choice: “I’ve just ‘enjoyed’ a corned beef sandwich with mustard and jalapeños. I’ll let you know when and if my eyeballs return.” When the reverse fixture was played between West Ham and Leeds it ended in a 2-2 draw. It was a close encounter with the score 1-1 at half-time, fans can expect more of the same this afternoon. Ezra has emailed and said: “As a Leeds United fan and tragic, I can guarantee all the neutrals that there will be goals, and plenty of them.” I’m guessing you mean West Ham goals? I’m hoping for a close encounter as the reverse fixture was earlier this season… Eric Peterson has got in touch via email and said: “This Toffee spent a few of this past overnight’s sleepless moments pondering David Moyes’ achievements in the service of Everton Football Club. A win today over the Damned United would be a worthy addition to that list, regardless of the club logo at the top of the sheet of paper upon which is written the terms of his current contract.” I can’t imagine Moyes helping Everton stay up is on his mind but there is not doubt about the facts, if West Ham win today it does help Everton slightly – they could still be relegated on the final day of the season regardless of today’s result. A special day for Declan Rice as six years ago he made his West Ham senior debut. Today could be his last game at the London Stadium with rumours he is heading to Arsenal in the summer. If you want to catch up on West Ham’s semi-final win to reach the Europa Conference League final, have a read of the report: If you have read one of my blogs before you’ll know I love a bit of snack chat. I am on the crisps today, specifically wheat crunchies, let me know what you’ve gone for via email or Twitter. You can also let me know your thoughts on the relegation battle. It is also a crucial weekend in the Women’s Super League. If Chelsea defeat Arsenal and Manchester United lose to Manchester City, Chelsea will secure the WSL for the fourth successive season. Chelsea are currently leading Arsenal 1-0 after kicking off at 12.30. At the other end of the table, if Leicester City win today then Reading will be relegated. Have a read of what this weekend means: Leeds manager Sam Allardyce said ahead of the game: “We have to deliver a three-point scenario to try to save our Premier League status. [We need to] fight to the end, but fight with the right temperament and have the right amount of control - and certainly don’t lose the game plan.” Moyes has also said: “We’ve maybe not had the season we all hoped for but we always wanted to have a good run in one of the cup competitions and if you chose one to go well in it would certainly be this one. We’ve adapted as best we can without Mark [Noble]. He’s a big miss. We are seeing some players step up but we are also seeing some who we think can do more. We will look to improve it again next season. It’s very difficult to get a replacement on Mark Noble, that is something that’s very hard.” On Sky Sports just now West Ham manager David Moyes said if someone had given them this table position, where they are safe from relegation, a few weeks ago he would have “shaken your hand and said thank you very much”. The winner of the 22/23 Premier League trophy was confirmed yesterday as Arsenal lost to Nottingham Forest, handing the crown to Manchester City. It is the third time in a row Pep Guardiola’s side have won the domestic title. Have a read of how City’s players fared this campaign: So how does it look at the bottom of the table? Everton are 17th after 37 games with 33 points and a goal difference of -25, Leeds are 18th after 36 games with 31 points and a goal difference of -24 and Leicester City are 19th after 36 games with 30 points and a goal difference of -18. Southampton are 20th and have had relegation already confirmed. The team news is here! West Ham have made six changes to their starting 11 who won their Europa Conference League semi-final. Areola, Kehrer, Aguerd, Cresswell, Benrahma and Antonio all drop out of the team. West Ham: Fabianski, Coufal, Zouma, Ogbonna, Emerson, Soucek, Rice, Bowen, Paqueta, Fornals, Ings Subs: Areola, Antonio, Benrahma, Cornet, Cresswell, Mubama, Johnson, Kehrer, Lanzini Leeds, meanwhile, have made two changes from their 2-2 draw with Newcastle last weekend. Firpo and Greenwood are out with Struijk and Forshaw coming in. Leeds: Robles, Ayling, Kristensen, Struijk, Wober, Koch, Forshaw, McKennie, Harrison, Rodrigo, Bamford. Subs: Meslier, Cooper, Mullen, Roca, Greenwood, Summerville, Aaronson, Georgino, Gnoto Hello and welcome to West Ham v Leeds which could have ramifications for the Premier League relegation battle. Nottingham Forest secured their spot in the top flight yesterday which means three teams are fighting for the last safety spot: Leeds, Everton and Leicester City. Leeds are currently in the relegation zone but they are just two points and two goals (for goal difference) from safety. A win over West Ham this afternoon would get them out of the red zone for now ahead of the final Premier League round next weekend. A win would not secure safety for the club though. Leeds will have to overcome West Ham, who are heading into this match after securing a spot in the Europa Conference League final. The Hammers also have home advantage at the London Stadium and so while David Moyes’ league form has not been on the money this season – they are only six points ahead of Leeds – they will be favourites to come away with the win. But thoughts come in from last season where Leeds were facing the drop and they managed to rescue themselves in the nick of time. It will be a tense encounter and one that should have fans on the edge of their seats. Team news will be out shortly so stay tuned for updates ahead of kick-off at 1.30pm BST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/italy-flooding-floods-emilia-romagna-cleanup-homeless-landslides","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:45:43Z","webTitle":"‘Roads have disappeared’: Italy begins cleanup after catastrophic floods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/italy-flooding-floods-emilia-romagna-cleanup-homeless-landslides","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/italy-flooding-floods-emilia-romagna-cleanup-homeless-landslides","fields":{"headline":"‘Roads have disappeared’: Italy begins cleanup after catastrophic floods","bodyText":"Standing outside her home under moody skies in Ronta, a hamlet in the Forlì-Cesena area of Emilia-Romagna, Ivana Casadei considers herself one of the lucky ones. “The water only came as far as our garden,” said the 61-year-old. “But my neighbours’ home was destroyed, so they are now staying with us – there are eight of us living together, and five dogs.” Emilia-Romagna remained on red alert on Sunday after catastrophic flooding that claimed 14 lives and left more than 36,000 people homeless. The emergency, which wreaked havoc across 100 cities and towns – many still under water – prompted the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, to return early from the G7 summit in Japan. A helicopter that had been attempting to restore electricity to homes crashed close to the badly affected town of Lugo on Saturday, injuring one of the four people onboard. “Frankly, I cannot remain so far from Italy in such a complex moment,” said Meloni, who visited some of the flooded areas on Sunday afternoon and pledged support to help the recovery. Casadei’s home was among the cluster that rescuers were unable to reach until Saturday, first because of strong winds that prevented dinghies from arriving and then because of a landslide that snapped a nearby road in two. One of her neighbours who died was Marinella Maraldi, whose body was swept 12 miles (19km) down the Savio River before being found in Cesenatico, a beach along the Adriatic coast. Maraldi’s husband, Sauro Manuzzi, also died, reportedly as they tried to save their farm animals, leaving behind their only daughter. “Marinella and I gave birth around the same time,” said Casadei. “They were a wonderful couple. None of us have experienced such disastrous flooding like this before – there are some people here who are close to age 100 who say they have never seen anything of the kind.” Most of those left homeless have been put up by family or friends, while others are staying in hotels or temporary shelters. Marina and her husband, whose home is uninhabitable, are among those staying with Casadei. “It hasn’t quite hit us yet,” said Marina, whose only salvaged item of clothing was her wedding dress. “We are in a daze … at the moment we just feel fortunate to be here, and are boosted by the solidarity. But then afterwards, the depression will probably come.” Rescuers, who have been joined by thousands of volunteers, many of them young people who travelled from across Italy, are working relentlessly to clean mud and debris from the streets, or bring food and clothing to people living in shelters and isolated areas. Mountains of furniture lined a street in Ronta as volunteers formed a human chain to lift buckets of flood water from an apartment building. Lorenzo Camagni, 25, said he had not slept in three nights. “Over 2.5 metres [8ft] of water flooded our home,” he added. “I tried to pump the water away for nine hours straight before the rescuers came. My parents are devastated … but then we also feel lucky as so many are worse off than us.” Six months’ worth of rain fell within 36 hours across Emilia-Romagna, one of Italy’s most important agricultural regions. Just two weeks ago, the area was hit by intense storms that killed two people. The floods were preceded by a drought that had dried out the land, reducing its capacity to absorb water. More than 305 landslides were caused by the latest floods, which in turn either damaged or closed off 500 roads. Weather-related disasters have been on the rise in Italy, a country deemed particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis. Enzo Lattuca, the mayor of Cesena, said people in the area were given a warning 24 hours before the storms. But he had trouble convincing some people to leave their homes, particularly those living in hillside hamlets. “There was still sunshine at that point and many people didn’t think it would happen,” he said. “One woman, who didn’t want to leave her home, told me she only believed it was happening when the water was at her feet.” Showing a photo of a severely damaged road on his mobile phone, Lattuca said: “I don’t even know if it will be possible to repair it.” Paride Antolini, the president of the geologists order for the Emilia-Romagna region, said the “landslide bombing” was “distorting the cartography of the area”. “Many roads have completely disappeared,” he told the Ansa news agency. “In my 63 years I have never seen anything like it, it’s too much even for a geologist.” Areas along the Emilia-Romagna coastline were also affected by the floods, with debris washing up on beaches. Beach club owners have rushed to clean up their resorts in the hope of salvaging the holiday season, as hotels reported many cancellations over the weekend and during the last week of May. “Tourism is obviously fundamental; many of us survive off the summer season,” said Simone Battistoni, president of the union of beach club owners in the Cesenatico area. “But we are ready to welcome people. Until then, 30 of us are working in shifts to bring essential supplies to the people who have been left homeless.” In Riccione, a popular town that was partly affected by the floods, beach club owner Raoul Conti said: “We all worked to clean up the beach in a couple of days, but we feel fortunate, and so our thoughts are with our neighbours just a few kilometres away. Obviously the start of the season has been affected but I don’t think it will influence the rest of the season – people from Emilia-Romagna are stubborn, and we will double down to ensure it’s a good one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/21/west-ham-leeds-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:41:23Z","webTitle":"West Ham strike hammer blow to Leeds’ survival bid as Lanzini caps comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/west-ham-leeds-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/21/west-ham-leeds-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"West Ham strike hammer blow to Leeds’ survival bid as Lanzini caps comeback","bodyText":"This was an abject, pitiful way for Leeds United to squander the chance to take control of their destiny. There was no urgency during a wretched second half, no defiance, and no attempt to stop the day ending in another party for West Ham when Lucas Paquetá, dancing past a feeble challenge from Rasmus Kristensen in added time, gave Manuel Lanzini the opportunity to kill off any prospect of a dramatic comeback. The stench of relegation hung over Leeds when Lanzini’s goal completed a lively performance from West Ham. Sam Allardyce had seethed throughout the second half, the arch survivalist even spitting out his chewing gum and kicking it away in anger at one stage, and he spoke with an air of resignation afterwards. Listening to him run through his side’s problems, it was as if he had already accepted where this is heading. Allardyce has taken only one point since replacing Javi Gracia last month and, while there was a bit of noise about leaving nothing to chance when Tottenham visit Elland Road on the final day, the 68‑year‑old was almost raising the white flag when he turned his thoughts to how to reconfigure his attack after losing Patrick Bamford and Rodrigo to injury here. The galling thing for Allardyce was that his side had displayed none of the fight that brought Everton a crucial point at Wolves on Saturday. A win would have taken Leeds out of the bottom three and Rodrigo volleyed them ahead in the 17th minute. Yet familiar flaws soon took hold. It was as if Leeds, who have not kept a clean sheet since 25 February, thought it was going to be easy. They played as if they were sitting pretty in mid-table; as if they assumed that West Ham would already be dreaming of facing Fiorentina in next month’s Europa Conference League final. Everton and Leicester, the other sides left in the relegation scrap, need not have worried. West Ham played with integrity, even though their win against AZ Alkmaar on Thursday had taken a physical and emotional toll, and made light of David Moyes’s decision to make six changes. The game changed when Declan Rice equalised and it was little surprise when Jarrod Bowen made it 2-1 midway through the second half. Admittedly West Ham did not start well. It was not long before Rice was urging his teammates to wake up. They were being caught out by simple balls over the top and were fortunate not to concede when Rodrigo misread Bamford’s cross. Leeds also went close when Jack Harrison volleyed at Leeds at Lukasz Fabianski. Allardyce had made only two changes, Pascal Struijk replacing the suspended Junior Firpo at left-back and the steely Adam Forshaw coming in for Sam Greenwood in midfield, and the plan was working when the visitors went ahead. The goal could not have been more Allardycian: a long throw from Weston McKennie, a mass of bodies in the West Ham area. Cue the battle. Players from both sides leapt for the header and everyone missed it. Rodrigo, holding off Angelo Ogbonna, smashed a volley past Fabianski. Throw-in, volley: could there possibly be a simpler route to goal? The ignominy stung West Ham, especially as they had conceded in similar fashion against Brentford last weekend. Wary of a rollocking from Moyes, they began to play. Joel Robles denied Tomas Soucek. The strain began to show on Leeds. West Ham soon put together a lovely move. The ingenuity came from Pablo Fornals after he took a pass from Bowen. The Spaniard, West Ham’s goalscorer in Alkmaar, scooped a beautiful pass over Struijk and Bowen lifted the ball across for Rice to mark the sixth anniversary of his professional debut by equalising with a composed finish at the far post. Much has changed since an 18‑year‑old Rice came off the bench in a win against Burnley in 2017. The midfielder is likely to leave this summer and this may well have been his last home game for West Ham. Nobody, though, can accuse Rice of letting his focus drift. He is still driving this team on and his goal led to a period of dominance from the hosts, Robles denying them a second when he smothered an effort from Emerson Palmieri. Leeds were beginning to panic. Bamford limped off after the equaliser, Wilfried Gnonto coming on, and Allardyce turned away in irritation after Harrison failed to punish an error from Kurt Zouma just before half-time. West Ham, who replaced Zouma with Thilo Kehrer during the interval, looked more assertive. There were chances for Paquetá, Soucek and Danny Ings. Leeds could not get anything going and West Ham were rewarded for their dominance when Bowen beat Robles with a cute finish after a fine pass from Ings. Leeds got what they deserved. Brendan Aaronson, Gnonto and Crysencio Summerville were criticised by Allardyce for doing little after coming on. There was a brief rally and Emerson denied Summerville. Yet it was too little too late, and that is likely to be the story of Leeds’s season. They had the sinking feeling when Paquetá set up Lanzini."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/21/it-was-utterly-surreal-police-accused-of-farcical-error-after-14-arrested-at-seminar-on-day-of-coronation","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:29:22Z","webTitle":"‘It was utterly surreal’: police accused of farcical error after 14 arrested at seminar on day of coronation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/21/it-was-utterly-surreal-police-accused-of-farcical-error-after-14-arrested-at-seminar-on-day-of-coronation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/21/it-was-utterly-surreal-police-accused-of-farcical-error-after-14-arrested-at-seminar-on-day-of-coronation","fields":{"headline":"‘It was utterly surreal’: police accused of farcical error after 14 arrested at seminar on day of coronation","bodyText":"“I felt that they knew by the time they had taken us to the station in the van that they had the wrong people,” said Lauren, 26, a medical writer in the pharmaceutical industry. The post-coronation wash-up over the last fortnight has been marked by an array of surreal stories of bungled arrests, from the republican activists swept up by police for possession of luggage straps to the pro-monarchy Australian architect who had been simply seeking to enjoy a pleasant day out at Westminster Abbey. It has been notable that in each of those cases, after intense media attention, the Metropolitan police has since admitted some regret and announced that no further action would be taken. On the subject of a third raid that morning in Haggerston, east London, about five miles away from the coronation at Westminster Abbey, where shortly before 10.30am 14 people were arrested “on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance”, there has been no such candour from Scotland Yard. Today, in a frank and occasionally humorous account of the day, despite the clear shock those involved continue to feel, Lauren and those detained alongside her – including a primary school teacher, an owner of an animal rescue centre and a former senior civil servant – ask that Scotland Yard breaks its silence about what they say was manifestly a farcical case of mistaken identity. The group, almost entirely female or non-binary, aged between their mid-20s and late 60s and largely new to activism, let alone its more extreme manifestations, were arrested on suspicion of being a Just Stop Oil cell intent on disrupting the crowning of Charles III. In reality, they had gathered in a small nondescript room in a rented work space in east London for a seven-hour seminar about the theory, history and practice of non-violent protest after expressing an interest in the social activist group Animal Rising, largely via its website. “I was there to actually avoid the coronation,” said Tony Jenkins, 58, the only male attender, who runs South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty. His last involvement with the police was when working alongside officers in Operation Takahe as they sought to track down the so-called Croydon cat killer. “It was utterly surreal,” said Caitlin, 29, from Finsbury Park, north London, who until a few weeks before her arrest – her first – had been a civil servant with high-level of security clearance. “I had almost brought my husband and dog along, and I am glad I didn’t because I don’t know what I would have done with the dog.” Louisa Hillwood, 29, a primary school teacher in Hackney, was due to lead the “non-violent protest” training course that day from 10.30am to 5pm. She had attended a couple of the sessions herself and was comparatively experienced. There was coffee and tea on hand for people as they drifted into the ground-floor room. A whiteboard had “non-violent training” written across it. The morning would be given over to introductions. Each of the group, sat in chairs in a circle, would be asked to speak of their hopes and fears about protesting and in relation to the day of quite intense and – dare it be said – quite dry learning ahead of them. A discussion about the history of non-violent protest, taking in the civil rights movement, and then some pointers on their rights, would follow. The highlight of the day, for those looking for some action, would be at the end when the attenders would be invited to take part in some role play about how to react if someone is shouting abuse at you. “It would be things like active listening, like trying to empathise with the people, but also not tolerating violence from others and ensuring that the situation doesn’t escalate,” said Hillwood. “None of us had met before, I still didn’t even know most of their names and then about 10.25, we hear ‘police, police, we are coming in’,” recalled Hillwood, who had been arrested once before at a “rescue” of dogs last year from a breeding centre used by the medical researchers. About 25 officers swarmed around the seated group, with all the drama of a terrorist swoop. “They were all talking at once, saying you are under arrest, so I couldn’t hear why,” Hillwood said. “I said: ‘What are you talking about?’ Because they were saying that we were Just Stop Oil and that we were going to disrupt the coronation. And I was just like: ‘Absolutely not. I mean, we’re miles away. And we’re going to be here all day. We’ve got no intention of leaving.’” By this time, the king’s procession was already arriving at Westminster Abbey. Jenkins was told not to sip his coffee. “The officer said: ‘You can’t do that, it could be poisoned or something.’ And then we were searched.” Only two of the 14 did not get handcuffed. There was one female officer. It took a while for her to make her way round the group. “They found my old Cabinet Office business card in my wallet, and were, ‘Ehm, OK’,” said Caitlin. They were put in minivans outside the building, with eight of the group taken to Brixton police station in south London and six to Stoke Newington in north London. Hillwood was sat in the vehicle for hour and a half before disembarking in Brixton. There was a further 90-minute wait outside the station before being checked in at the custody desk. It was 4pm by the time Hillwood was led to her cell. She asked for her solicitor and was served a vegan “all day breakfast”.“It was literally beans,” Hillwood said. A solicitor advised her to offer no comment to the officers’ questions. But when it came to his turn, Jenkins felt no such compunction. “I said my intention was to sit in an all-day training course learning about non-violent protests, meet some new people and avoid the coronation.” The group were let out late in the evening on bail pending further investigation. Those arrested have since tried to piece together what may have happened. They learned that Just Stop Oil had previously used the building for meetings, along with many other organisations. The police had mentioned some placards lying around in part of the building, and some paint unconnected to the training. The truth, said Caitlin, was that it was a horrible bungle. Animal Rising is planning a civil case for wrongful arrest and imprisonment. “I want the police to drop it,” said Caitlin. “I want my phone and my watch back and I want this wiped from the police database.” The Metropolitan police has declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-452-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:19:16Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 452 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-452-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-452-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 452 of the invasion","bodyText":"In a G7 speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy later laid flowers at a cenotaph in Hiroshima honouring those who died after the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945. At a later press conference, Zelenskiy said he dreams of rebuilding “all our cities that are in ruins” similar to Hiroshima’s regeneration. “Russia has trampled on everything that is civilised.” During the press conference, Zelenskiy said Bakhmut was not occupied by Russia ‘as of today’. Earlier there was confusion when Zelenskiy appeared to confirm the loss of the city to Russia, saying “I think no” when asked if it remained in Kyiv’s control. His spokesperson later said that response referred to the question of whether Russia had control. Later, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister claimed Ukrainian forces had partly encircled the besieged eastern city. A senior general added that Ukraine’s forces controlled an “insignificant” part of the Bakhmut, but not enough to enter the devastated city. The Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated the Wagner mercenary force and the Russian army for what he called the “liberation” of Bakhmut, which Russia calls by its Soviet-era name of Artyomovsk. Zelenskiy said he is confident Kyiv will receive F-16 fighter jets from the west but that he was unsure how many. He added that he had secured high-quality weapons from everyone at the G7 summit but dodged questions as to when Ukraine’s counteroffensive would begin. Joe Biden said he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden also announced a new package of military aid of up to $375m for Ukraine, telling Zelenskiy that the US was doing all it could to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. Biden, meeting with the Ukrainian leader on the sidelines of the G7 summit of world leaders in Japan, said the military aid package included ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. In a G7 press conference, the US president pledged “our shared and unwavering commitment to stand with the brave people of Ukraine”. He said: “Putin will not break our resolve”. Russia’s foreign ministry has dismissed the G7 summit in Japan’s Hiroshima as a “politicised” event that it said pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said that the G7 had “irreversibly deteriorated” A Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region said Kyiv had struck the Russian-held port city of Berdyansk with British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles. This claim has not been verified. German police said they were investigating the possible poisoning of two Russian exiles who attended a conference in Berlin at the end of April, organised by Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had invited India to join Ukraine’s peace formula during his talks with the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the summit. Zelenskiy said on Telegram that they also discussed Ukraine’s needs in de-mining and mobile hospitals during their first face-to-face meeting since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Reuters reported. Western countries will be running “colossal risks” if they supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, as saying on Saturday. Biden has told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programmes for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighters, senior US officials said. Pope Francis has tasked a leading Italian cardinal with a mission in hopes it can “ease tensions” in the Ukraine war and lead to a path of peace, the Vatican said Saturday. In a brief written statement, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said Francis had entrusted the mission to Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, who is close to the pontiff. The Associated Press reports that Bruni said the timetable and the mechanics of the mission “are currently under study”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/may/21/don-giovanni-review-glyndebourne-mariame-clement-obsession-distress-and-danger-in-uneven-new-staging","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:14:28Z","webTitle":"Don Giovanni review – obsession, distress and danger in uneven new production","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/21/don-giovanni-review-glyndebourne-mariame-clement-obsession-distress-and-danger-in-uneven-new-staging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/21/don-giovanni-review-glyndebourne-mariame-clement-obsession-distress-and-danger-in-uneven-new-staging","fields":{"headline":"Don Giovanni review – obsession, distress and danger in uneven new production","bodyText":"Each age sees its concerns reflected in Mozart’s Don Giovanni, more acutely, perhaps, than in any other opera. “Once a figure of rebellion against conventions,” director Mariame Clément writes in a recent Guardian article, “he has come to embody what many rebel against today. In today’s world,” she adds, “many people would consider Giovanni himself a patriarchal figure whose statue they would gladly topple.” And indeed the first thing we see in her new Glyndebourne production is video footage of his statue being hauled to the ground as Leporello looks on. What follows, however, is altogether more uncertain. Clément acknowledges that this most complex of operas admits a multiplicity of interpretations, and she is often far from simplistic in her approach to its ironies and ambiguities. But what she offers can also be anodyne and fussy, at odds on occasion with the sensuality and demonic fire we find in the score, despite the belching flames that here accompany Giovanni’s eventual descent to hell. The setting is a hotel where all the characters are guests, and where Zerlina (Victoria Randem) and Masetto (Michael Mofidian), are having their hen and stag parties – though the fact that they are not yet married in some ways dilutes the threat, moral as well as sexual, posed to their relationship by Andrey Zhilikovsky’s charismatic if predatory Don. Clément dispenses with the fashionable trope that Anna (Venera Gimadieva) really desires Giovanni, though, in a twist to the narrative, she is now sleeping with Oleksiy Palchykov’s Ottavio, to the Commendatore’s (Jerzy Butrin) evident concern. Mikhail Timoshenko’s sympathetic if conflicted Leporello, meanwhile, seething with resentment, is genuinely distressed at the thought of his own wife being subject to Giovanni’s attentions, but is also uneasily fascinated by the multiple photos of breasts – a horribly objectified visual list of his master’s conquests – that appear on the walls during the Catalogue Aria. There are too many extras wandering round when they’re not really needed, however, while Ruzan Mantashyan’s Elvira, portrayed as conventionally obsessive here, makes her first appearance way too early, searching for Giovanni among the hotel guests during the Anna/Ottavio duet. Zhilikovsky sounds as attractive as he looks, which makes him very dangerous, and Timoshenko is terrific with his irony and wounded pride. Mofidian and Randem are similarly outstanding: he’s sweet, affectionate and touching despite the bluster; her Vedrai Carino is meltingly lovely. Gimadieva, however, seemed oddly cautious throughout. Mantashyan is impressive, if steely in Mi Tradì, while Palchykov makes a strikingly assertive Ottavio albeit vocally somewhat constricted. Conductor Evan Rogister hurtles through the score, often favouring breakneck speed over dramatic weight. Despite occasional slips in stage-pit coordination, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment played for him with sinewy leanness of tone and admirable clarity. • In rep until 15 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/boris-becker-daughter-anna-ermakova-wins-german-equivalent-strictly-come-dancing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:11:46Z","webTitle":"Boris Becker’s daughter wins German equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/boris-becker-daughter-anna-ermakova-wins-german-equivalent-strictly-come-dancing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/boris-becker-daughter-anna-ermakova-wins-german-equivalent-strictly-come-dancing","fields":{"headline":"Boris Becker’s daughter wins German equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing","bodyText":"The daughter of the tennis star Boris Becker has won the final of Germany’s equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing with a record number of votes. Anna Ermakova, the 23-year-old offspring of the Wimbledon champion and the Russian model Angela Ermakova, triumphed on Let’s Dance on Friday evening with what critics described as a “breathtaking performance” over the course of a series during which she scored the full 30 points on 11 occasions, breaking a previous record. The newspaper Bild said Ermakova’s main motivation for taking part in the show had been to establish an identity for herself in her own right beyond her parents’ infamous brief encounter in a side room at a London restaurant, where she was conceived. “She wanted to show above all that she’s more than just “that daughter from … ”, the tabloid said. For years, Ermakova, who has previously worked as a model, has been referred to as the “baby from the broom cupboard encounter”. Ermakova, who executed skilful moves with her dance partner, Valentin Lusin, and cut a striking figure in an array of stunning dresses, wooing the audience in particular with a freestyle performance as Alice in Wonderland, a passionate tango and a slow waltz, said she was overwhelmed by the reception. “I came from England to Germany in order to dance. I never thought I’d be welcomed with such open arms,” she told the presenter of Let’s Dance, in a mix of German and English, visibly moved. She said she had initially abandoned her dream to become a ballerina in order to pursue an art history course in London, but hoped to pursue a dancing and acting career on the back of her success, saying she had already received offers. Ermakova told the broadcaster RTL that rather than professional dancing, she would “prefer to go in the direction of show business. I love to perform and to make people happy.” Becker is trying to restore his reputation following his recent deportation to Germany after being released from what he has described as a “brutal” experience in a UK prison where he served time for hiding millions of pounds in assets and loans. He sent his daughter a video message via Instagram before the final. In it he praised her personality and told her she had won the hearts of Germans, who were sharing the thrill with her. “Whatever happens, you’ve already conquered the hearts of the Germans – you’ve taken them by storm. Your talent, your discipline, your performance and more – your personality are amazing. And I couldn’t be prouder,” he said. Becker had initially failed to accept he was the father of Ermakova, his third child. Eventually a DNA test proved he was. In a recent two-part documentary, Boom! Boom! The World vs Boris Becker, which premiered at this year’s Berlin film festival, he spoke openly to Alex Gibney about the episode referred to as “the broom cupboard affair”, which became a defining moment in the history of tabloid journalism. In the interview, he said rather than a broom cupboard, he would describe it as a “small back room” of the luxury London restaurant where he and Angela Ermakova had set eyes on each other in 1999. Previously, in his 2003 autobiography Hold On, Stay a While he referred to it as “not an affair” and “just poom-bah-boom”. He said the two parted without exchanging contact details and he had thought nothing else of it. He admitted he had had sex with Ermakova, then a waitress, only hours after his pregnant then wife, Barbara, had gone into hospital with contractions. He had a couple of beers before heading to the upmarket Nobu restaurant, meeting Ermakova. Eight months after the incident he received a fax at his Munich office in which Ermakova asked for a meeting and announced he was to become a father. After long denying he was her father, despite the striking physical similarities between them, namely her red hair, he later pledged to visit Anna regularly, stating: “I will learn to love her.” Following the release of the documentary last month, Angela Ermakova expressed annoyance that he would not stop talking about how her daughter was conceived. In a statement on Instagram she wrote that “whatever mistakes he makes, whatever pain he causes to others, he never accepts the guilt, and instead blames his victims”. According to reports, in her contract with RTL Ermakova said if her father’s name was mentioned during the show the broadcaster would face a fine. For the occasion of Germany’s Father’s Day last week, Becker posted a rare picture of him, his daughter and Angela Ermakova on Instagram taken in London in 2020, along with pictures of his other three children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/21/philosopher-peter-singer-theres-no-reason-to-say-humans-have-more-worth-or-moral-status-than-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:00:28Z","webTitle":"Philosopher Peter Singer: ‘There’s no reason to say humans have more worth or moral status than animals’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/philosopher-peter-singer-theres-no-reason-to-say-humans-have-more-worth-or-moral-status-than-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/21/philosopher-peter-singer-theres-no-reason-to-say-humans-have-more-worth-or-moral-status-than-animals","fields":{"headline":"Philosopher Peter Singer: ‘There’s no reason to say humans have more worth or moral status than animals’","bodyText":"Australian philosopher Peter Singer’s book Animal Liberation, published in 1975, exposed the realities of life for animals in factory farms and testing laboratories and provided a powerful moral basis for rethinking our relationship to them. Now, nearly 50 years on, Singer, 76, has a revised version titled Animal Liberation Now. It comes on the heels of an updated edition of his popular Ethics in the Real World, a collection of short essays dissecting important current events, first published in 2016. Singer, a utilitarian, is a professor of bioethics at Princeton University. In addition to his work on animal ethics, he is also regarded as the philosophical originator of a philanthropic social movement known as effective altruism, which argues for weighing up causes to achieve the most good. He is considered one of the world’s most influential – and controversial – philosophers. Why write Animal Liberation Now? The last full update was 1990. Though the philosophical arguments have stood up well, the chapters that describe factory farming and what we do to animals in labs needed to be almost completely rewritten. I also hadn’t really discussed factory farming’s contribution to the climate crisis and I wanted to reflect on our progress towards animal rights. Effectively, this is a new book for the next generation, hence the new title. What progress have we made in our treatment of animals since the original book? And what have we learned about animal sentience? There have been some improvements in factory farming practices in some regions of the world, but in others we have hit new lows. China now has enormous factory farms and lacks any national standards for raising animals for food. Extreme forms of confinement also still dominate the US states with the most pigs and laying hens. Animal experimentation is now regulated in many developed nations, but what’s notable is how minimal it is in the US, where the vast majority of animals used in experiments aren’t covered. On animal sentience, we now have strong evidence that fish too can feel pain. There are also good reasons for thinking the same of some invertebrates – the octopus but also lobsters and crabs. How far sentience extends into other invertebrates is unclear. Can you explain your position against speciesism, the belief most humans hold that we are superior to other animals? Shouldn’t humans count more? Just as we accept that race or sex isn’t a reason for a person counting more, I don’t think the species of a being is a reason for counting more than another being. What is important is the capacity to suffer and to enjoy life. We should give equal consideration to the similar interests of all sentient beings. Defenders of speciesism argue that humans have a special rational nature that sets them apart from animals, but the problem is where that leaves infants and the profoundly intellectually disabled. Instead of defending the idea that all humans have rights but no animals do, we should recognise that many things we do to animals cause so much pain and yet are so inessential to us that we ought to refrain. We can be against speciesism and still favour beings with higher cognitive capacities, which most humans have – but that is drawing a line for a different reason. If there are animals that have higher cognitive capacities than some humans, there’s no reason to say that the humans have more worth or moral status simply because they are human. The chapters in Animal Liberation Now about animal testing and factory farming are upsetting to read. Were they upsetting to write and rewrite and what pulled you through? I found them very upsetting, both 48 years ago and as I’ve worked on them over the past year. But I also felt driven to complete them so people know and can help stop it. I’ve had to develop a thicker skin and sometimes have had trouble getting to sleep, but it needed to be done. I do steer away from emotive language. I’ve never considered myself an animal lover and I don’t want to only appeal to animal lovers. I want people to see this as a basic moral wrong. You have provoked the ire of the disability rights advocates over the years, including by arguing that parents should have the right the end the lives of severely disabled newborns. This has been criticised as an ableist view that could lead to other disabled people being less valued. What’s your response? In general, I think it is better to have abilities than not to have them. Most people hold that view. Obviously, there are forms of discrimination against disabled people that we should firmly reject. Ableism has a sound purpose when it calls out discrimination against disabled people on grounds not related to their disability. If parents have a newborn with a severe disability and that child needs to be on a respirator to survive, doctors will invite parents to decide whether to allow the child to die. That happens regularly and is generally uncontroversial. Yet it is what the child’s future will be like that is really relevant. And I think, even in cases where the child doesn’t need a respirator, parents should be able to consult doctors to reach a considered judgment, including that the child’s life is not one that is going to be a benefit for the child or for their family, and that therefore it is better to end the child’s life. If that is ableist, then it isn’t always wrong to be ableist. You argue there are certain situations where we could replace the animals we experiment on with humans… During the Covid pandemic, I supported 1Day Sooner, an organisation of well informed volunteers offering to test the efficacy of candidate vaccines. That could have saved many thousands of lives by speeding up vaccine introduction, but the volunteers were rejected. There is also a case for beneficially using humans in persistent vegetative states from which we can be absolutely clear that they will never recover. People could sign consent statements, as they do with organ donation, saying they don’t mind their body being used for research if that were to happen. While effective altruism – the philanthropic social movement you helped originate – has its critics, it has gained a following in recent years, including in Silicon Valley tech circles (disgraced cryptocurrency founder Sam Bankman-Fried was prominent in the movement). One newer idea it has spawned is longtermism. It prioritises the distant future over the concerns of today and advocates reducing the risk of our extinction, for example, by thwarting the possibility of hostile artificial intelligence (AI) and colonising space. To what extent do you endorse longtermism? We should think about the long-term future and we ought to try to reduce risks of extinction. Where I disagree with some effective altruists is how dominant longtermism should become in the movement. We need some balance between reducing the extinction risks and making the world a better place now. We shouldn’t negate our present problems or our relatively short-term future, not least because we can have much higher confidence that we can help people in these timeframes. Though the lives of people in the future aren’t of any less value, how we can best help people millennia from now is uncertain. Are you vegan and how did you first become concerned about animal suffering? “Flexibly vegan” is how I would describe myself today. I don’t do it much, but I have no objection to eating oysters – I don’t think they can suffer – and oyster farming is quite an environmentally sustainable industry. Also, if I am out somewhere where it’s a real problem, I will go for something vegetarian. That my everyday purchases are vegan is the main thing. My journey began when I was a graduate student in philosophy at Oxford University in 1970. It was thanks to another graduate student explaining why he hadn’t chosen the meat option when we had lunch one day: he was vegetarian because he didn’t think the animals were treated right. My wife and I did some reading and became vegetarians soon after. Becoming mostly vegan took longer. Conscientious omnivores oppose factory farming but continue to eat animal products from farmers who treat their animals well and don’t subject them to suffering. Do they get a pass? Honestly, I can’t show that they are wrong. Assume that the cows wouldn’t have existed if they weren’t going to be sold for their meat and the conscientious omnivores investigate how their food is produced, and can be confident that the animals really do have good lives and are killed painlessly and without suffering – then I think they do get a pass. They’re allies in the movement against factory farming, and a world of conscientious omnivores would produce much less meat and dairy products, with vastly less suffering. What of meat grown from cultured animal cells? That gets more than a pass and I hope to try it soon. What is needed now is to produce it cheaply at scale. It is much better for the climate than meat from animals and for animal suffering. And while it is true that it still suggests that meat is desirable, there are people who are unwilling to make that switch to becoming vegan or vegetarian. The companies’ use of fetal bovine serum to develop their products is regrettable and I am pleased that many companies have found alternatives and stopped using it, but if there are no alternatives, its use can be justified. I don’t regard it as a reason for never eating them. You’ve brought vegan recipes back in Animal Liberation Now. Why resurrect them and do you have a particular favourite? Popular demand! In 1975 there weren’t many good vegetarian or vegan cookbooks so it made sense to include recipes. Then, as that changed, I didn’t think people needed the recipes any more so I took them out. What I have put back is different. The focus is on my and my wife’s dishes. Both vegan recipes from our childhoods that we still make and then things we have started cooking since becoming mostly vegan. I have shifted to more Asian food and a favourite is the recipe for dal. It is a good meal and easy to make. What are you working on now? The ethics of AI as it affects animals. A colleague and I published our first paper on this last year. We need to ensure the AI systems starting to be used in factory farms to manage animals don’t further negatively affect their lives, that self-driving cars are programmed to avoid hitting animals and that biases against farm animals that can be replicated and reinforced through AI are minimised. ChatGPT refuses to give recipes for cooking dogs on the grounds that it is unethical but readily provides recipes for cooking chickens. • Animal Liberation Now by Peter Singer is published on 8 June by the Bodley Head (£20).

It has been a long day, there is nothing in the fridge, cooking seems arduous and the solution is obvious: takeaway. It’s easy for takeaways to drift from once-in-a-while treat to twice-weekly emotional crutch. At some point, you have to wonder: even if you don’t look different in the mirror, is it doing you any harm? There is some evidence that too many takeaways can lead to weight gain, but the relationship isn’t clearcut. A 2022 study found a correlation between eating takeaway-style food in the 24 hours before taking the survey and increased BMI in participants, although the researchers were careful to point out that they didn’t know whether frequently eating takeaways made people overweight, or whether overweight people frequently eat takeaways. There is, however, evidence that simply living near (or walking past) a takeaway outlet or two can have an impact on body weight, with exposure to outlets on a commute, or near the office, most likely to tempt people. But why? Well, takeaway food tends to be high in fat and salt – ingredients that are relatively cheap and taste good, making you more likely to reorder. “It’s worth noting that big food companies put considerable effort into identifying the combinations of ingredients that make their food particularly moreish, which drives overconsumption,” says Kim Pearson, a nutritionist and the founder of Intelligent Weight Loss. “It’s much easier to overeat a highly processed pizza containing refined carbs, fat and salt, compared with a plate of vegetables or salad.” Pizza also tends to be calorie-dense in a way that is easy to underestimate – a single slice of takeaway pizza might be 250 to 350 calories, which doesn’t sound too bad until you accidentally eat four (or was it five?) of them. There is also some evidence that junk food can be addictive, as the combination of salt, fat and sugar makes it hard to stop eating. On the plus side, there doesn’t seem to be anything inherently bad about monosodium glutamate, or MSG, the umami-tinged flavour enhancer often used in Asian cooking. Many of the studies purporting to show its negative effects use doses that would never arise in cookery. There is also the nutritional quality of the ingredients themselves. “Most takeaways contain highly processed ingredients and additives, refined and nutrient-devoid carbohydrates and plenty of deep-fried foods cooked in refined seed oils heated to high temperatures,” says Pearson. “In the case of meat, it’s highly unlikely that your takeaway provider is using free-range, organic meat. They are far more likely to be using poor-quality, factory-farmed meat.” This isn’t just an issue for the animals – studies show that grass-fed beef, the kind raised in better conditions, typically has a better profile of fatty acids and a higher antioxidant content than the grain-fed variety. (There is also some evidence that stressed animals taste worse, but it’s less clear whether there is any impact on their nutrient profile.) So, what is the – ah-ha – takeaway message? If you are going to indulge, consider the options: “If you’re going to eat meat, beef and lamb are typically much less likely to have been intensively reared compared with chicken or pork,” says Pearson. “Avoid factory-farmed and processed meats such as most chicken nuggets or the pork found in pepperoni or pork balls. Instead, go for unprocessed meat, like the chunks of lamb found in curries and beef in stir-fries.” The worst offenders on any menu are likely to be deep-fried foods, or anything covered in high-sugar sauces. If you order Chinese food, opt for steamed dumplings, grilled fish or soup. If you are going for Indian food, go light on the naan bread and heavy on the side dishes, which are often more flavourful (so make you feel fuller faster) and nutrient-dense. If you are going for pizza, non-branded might be best – local places often cook fresh to order, with fewer additive-laden ingredients. Alternatively, think outside the box. “I’m a fan of Vietnamese food – think green papaya salad, summer rolls, braised or grilled sea bass, plus greens for side dishes. There are also Lebanese options like tabouleh salad, aubergine and tomato dishes, lamb shish kebab and lentil soup,” says Pearson. Finally, try to cut your consumption: consider switching your commute to take you past fewer tempting eateries; hide the menus; delete the apps on your phone. If you are going to default to the easiest option, try to make it the healthier one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2023/may/21/kaytramine-review-spry-sparkling-rap-collaboration","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T14:00:28Z","webTitle":"Kaytraminé: Kaytraminé review – spry, sparkling rap collaboration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/21/kaytramine-review-spry-sparkling-rap-collaboration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/21/kaytramine-review-spry-sparkling-rap-collaboration","fields":{"headline":"Kaytraminé: Kaytraminé review – spry, sparkling rap collaboration","bodyText":"Over the past decade, Canadian producer Louis Celestin, AKA Kaytranada, has filled dancefloors with his distinct brand of funk-forward house music.

A syncopated Afrobeat pulses beneath Pharrell’s vocals on standout 4EVA, while a pitched-up Aminé provides a counterpoint to Snoop Dogg’s verses on the synth-laden Eye. When the pair are producing alone the result is equally compelling, with Aminé meandering between R&amp;B vocals on the jazz references of Rebuke, while taking on baritone verses for the trap bass of Westside.

A motion led by the campaign group Humane League UK asked the mutual to adopt the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) – a set of standards adopted by Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and the Greggs bakery chain – and report on welfare improvements in a year’s time. It was supported by 96% of the 32,000 Co-op members who voted at the AGM. The BCC standards include banning cages, giving birds space of at least one square metre per 30kg, ditching “Frankenchicken” breeds – which grow at an accelerated rate – and giving birds minimum levels of light and perch space, as well as less painful slaughter conditions. Campaigners said the Co-op, which already met some BCC standards, including on stunning birds before slaughter, had now agreed to give chickens more space, equivalent to the BCC standards, but expressed disappointment it had not gone further. Aaron Parr, a senior campaigner at the Humane League UK and a member of the Co-op, said: “Co-op members have overwhelmingly voted to help chickens. It is inspirational that tens of thousands of members across the country have decided that the cruel use and abuse of Frankenchickens is outright wrong. But the Co-op leadership has betrayed its ethical and democratic values by clinging on to using Frankenchickens. The Co-op exists for its members – their democratic will must not be ignored by those at the top.” In a response to the motion posted on its website, the Co-op said that its free-range chicken already met the BCC standards and that its core chicken ranges met commitments on stunning, compliance with legislation and environment enrichment. The Co-op board, which has warned that profits are likely to fall in the year ahead amid “turbulent economic headwinds”, added that it would “continue to consider how we can enhance chicken welfare, including any opportunities to adopt elements of the Better Chicken Commitment, whilst recognising the need to offer good value to customers”. Its statement said: “We are acutely aware that in the current economic climate, it is more important than ever that we provide our members and customers with good-value, high-quality, responsibly sourced chicken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/21/tories-opposition-danger-national-conservatism-conference-rightwing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T13:09:11Z","webTitle":"Don’t celebrate the prospect of the Tories in opposition – that’s the real danger zone | Nesrine Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/21/tories-opposition-danger-national-conservatism-conference-rightwing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/21/tories-opposition-danger-national-conservatism-conference-rightwing","fields":{"headline":"Don’t celebrate the prospect of the Tories in opposition – that’s the real danger zone","bodyText":"Oblivion. Possibly even extinction. That’s where the Conservative party is headed, it would be safe to assume, after the local elections wipeout, persistently poor polling and the failure of any mythical “Sunak bounce” to materialise. Based on last week’s National Conservatism conference, it looks as though the extreme Brexit-addled wing of the party is all but guaranteeing the Conservatives’ obsolescence by swimming against the cultural tide, too. Tory MPs joined rightwing authors, journalists and cultural influencers for three days of broadly bonkers, anachronistic views on family values, white population decline and the merits of nationalism, much of which had seemingly racist and homophobic overtones. Marriage between a man and a woman was “the only possible basis for a safe and successful society”, said Tory MP Danny Kruger. Douglas Murray declared that nationalism shouldn’t be underrated simply because the Germans “mucked up twice in a century”. Weird? Yes. Out of touch? Definitely. But not entirely irrelevant. The fact that these conference attendees may soon not be in government or close to government doesn’t mean that their views hold little power, or that they are the preserve of some dangerous but quarantined “online right”. Theories about white replacement, the threat of multiculturalism, the death of Europe and of whiteness under siege have all been represented for some time in our politics and mainstream press, and among government advisers. The story here isn’t how the Conservative party will be reduced by its public choice of bedfellows if it decides they are its future, but how large, mainstream, well funded and coherent (I use this word in the technical, rather than logical sense) this larger rightwing movement is, and how little pushback there is to it in our politics and media. The values ecosystem, populated by a majority rightwing media, gullible and compromised institutions such as the BBC and the vocal representatives of well funded, opaque thinktanks such as Policy Exchange and the Legatum Institute (both represented at the conference) has successfully blocked any change in attitudes from materialising in the form of policy or a progressive political programme. There are consistent hopeful signs, based on trends and demographics, that hardline views on immigration and minorities are not embraced by the majority of the British public in any enthusiastic way, but it kind of doesn’t matter. Any alternatives that promote humane immigration policies, minority rights or organised objection to everything from structural racism to extractive private interests in our transport and energy infrastructure are portrayed as radical and undermining of native Britons’ interests. The legacy of that is a bedding-in of certain notions about what is forbidden in our politics – guardrails against change that will endure because the cost of challenging them is to incur the wrath, mockery and mobilisation of this “anti-woke” community. A vivid manifestation of those limitations is the rolling back of civil protest rights in the form of draconian public order laws, a cruel inhumane illegal migration bill, a dismissal of structural racism blessed by a government report and a Labour party that dare not suggest that these will be repealed or reopened once in government. The ways in which policy, both within and outside Westminster, is determined by former governmental actors was recently laid out in a peer-reviewed paper titled An anatomy of the British war on woke. Last week I spoke to its authors, Dr Huw C Davies, a sociologist at the University of Edinburgh, and Dr Sheena E MacRae, a researcher in digital sociology working with the University of Cambridge and the University of Hull. They found that in addition to being granted “extensive access” to public service broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4, “anti-woke” campaigners advocating against climate change policies and immigration, and for the “abnormalisation of social justice” have the regular use of 20 media outlets that amplify their message, including the Daily Telegraph, the Times, the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Daily Express, the Spectator, TalkRadio and GB News. They also isolated five thinktanks and several “charities” that they say publish and support anti-“woke” campaigners’ views, and motivated financial backers who continue to fund loss-making media ventures. “In no way should we trivialise this,” Davies told me. “Because it’s being translated into policy. The discourses lay the territory and make moral justifications” for policy. “It’s problematic regardless of who is in power,” MacRae added. “The number of actors, the number of channels, the space that they’re given, has allowed the vernacular to change. So much of the rhetoric is about projecting the left’s opinions. It’s about trying to do the thinking for the public. Political changes, particularly within the last six months – changes to rights to protest, threats to the Equality Act, changes to modes of voting – all add up to serious issues for an ongoing politic, let alone what happens within a particular term.” The success of this network, the paper demonstrates, is in projecting leftwing hegemony in the form of threats to a helpless white working class: its livelihood, cultural touchstones and sexual mores. Leftwing parties are held hostage to this projection and feel they must distance themselves from it. In doing so, they dilute their own political projects and fail to reflect voters’ needs and ambitions, and those promising progressive views that are consistently at odds with government policy. In short, there are electoral outcomes, and then there are political ones, and they are not always aligned. Just because the right will be out of government doesn’t mean that it will not, through a vast rightwing network, continue to impose its agenda, or at the very least limit the agenda of its opponents. If anything, the right in opposition, away from government and its limitations and accountabilities, could be the real danger zone – an incubation period for the Tory party and its network to escalate and finesse extremist rhetoric on racial and sexual minorities, the climate crisis and economic redistribution, and to grow and make connections with an increasingly international movement. In its wake will lie even more social discord, intense debate about people’s humanity and civil rights, and a hysterical, relentless condemnation of the “nightmare come true” of leftwing hegemony. The scale of the assault and the ubiquity of its organs may well render any Labour government – the party is already making noises about how little it can achieve in one term in terms of alleviating economic pain – impotent, or even short-lived. In this, the anti-woke circle will be aided first and foremost by complacency. Our public discourse is so spectacularly skewed to the right that we don’t even see it any more, like David Foster Wallace’s proverbial fish that asks “what the hell is water?”. Even as the rightwing machine revs up, Labour believes that if it focuses on the economy, doesn’t spook the horses by engaging on inflammatory issues on protest rights and identity and generally “rises above” the fetid rightwing swamp, that it guards its victory. At best this is a shortsighted political miscalculation; at worst it’s a moral abdication.

A stone path resembling a dry streambed reflects waterway migration, while big boulders recall those used by the authorities to thwart makeshift refugee camps in France.

Its creators say they want its “message of hope” to reach the millions who will watch TV coverage of the event, which is expected to be visited by King Charles. “Increasingly it feels like we’re living in a very polarised society, and in polarised spaces online, so finding ways for us to connect and have conversations is really important,” said Josie Naughton, co-founder and CEO of Choose Love, which provides refugees with everything from lifesaving search-and-rescue boats to food and legal advice. After the show, which takes place 22-27 May, the garden will be relocated to Good Food Matters in Croydon – a community food learning centre and garden working with people including those who have been forced to flee their homes. Among the volunteers who helped to build the garden was a man from a Central American country who told the Guardian the charity had helped with his mental health problems, which have worsened over the course of the two years he has been living in a hotel waiting for his asylum application to be processed. “Honestly, it is one of the lights in this journey that has helped my wife and I to cope,” said the man, who was reluctant to be identified while their application is still live. The couple said they had been forced to flee their country due to the threat of gang violence after finding themselves “in the wrong place at the wrong time”. The garden initiative and Good Food Matters brought them into contact with others in a similar state of limbo. Frustrated at the waste of their diverse range of professional skills, the volunteers spoke of how the garden had renewed their sense of purpose. The garden was created in collaboration with the designer Jane Porter – a gold medal winner at last year’s show, organised by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) – who visited a refugee camp in Samos, Greece, as part of her research. She said she had been inspired by what had been achieved by Choose Love, which was co-founded by her sister Dawn. She added: “In this garden we see linear drifts of the plants that are found along now established migration routes and discover what people grow when they don’t know when or if they’ll return home – when the act of planting becomes an act of hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2023/may/21/how-did-salt-and-pepper-become-the-standard-table-seasonings","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T13:01:26Z","webTitle":"How did salt and pepper become the standard table seasonings?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/21/how-did-salt-and-pepper-become-the-standard-table-seasonings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2023/may/21/how-did-salt-and-pepper-become-the-standard-table-seasonings","fields":{"headline":"How did salt and pepper become the standard table seasonings?","bodyText":"Why are salt and pepper considered the requisite table seasonings?

We feel as if that despair is not a shared experience – it’s a personal one. And so, by putting the experience into three dimensions in a public space, there’s a chance it may remind someone that they are not alone. That there are other people who have experienced that.” Hawkes, an award-winning garden designer, gives up his free time to quietly confront this fact on a regular basis. He has lost friends to suicide and is a listening volunteer for the helpline of the suicide prevention charity, Samaritans, to whom he has dedicated his show garden. “It’s not a real garden. I wouldn’t create this garden for a Samaritans centre. But if, as a show garden, it helps to communicate some of the lived experiences of people who reach out and call Samaritans, that starts a dialogue.” The idea for the garden – or at least, the feelings the garden would evoke – came to him like the fragments of a dream, and the space is intended to have an otherworldly, even nightmarish quality. At the entrance, slabs of reinforced concrete, shaped into brutal, frightening forms by Hawkes’s own hands, hang “uncomfortably low” from thin nylon wires. Unfamiliar, spiny, spiky, thorny plants – including the prickly, towering shape of Aralia chapaensis, a rare shrub – and lots of dark russet foliage crowd the visitor. “It’s the sort of colour you fall into, that draws you in, rather than reaching out to you.” There is only one way to escape: down a path cracked with deep fissures where the sound of gushing water can be heard. “We can’t see the water, we only hear this crazy turmoil.” Further ahead, a sculpture that looks like a “swirling vortex” of more than 3,000 recycled nails appears to fly out of the ruptured ground, creating a sense of foreboding or even menace. “There’s this feeling of, ‘Is everything closing in on me? Is the ground opening up underneath me? What lies beneath?’” Hawkes wanted to install a garden at Chelsea that would act as a polemic against the perfectly curated, manicured beauty of other designs. “A lot of what we do in gardens is reflective of good times, and feeling content and happy and at peace,” he says. “So if you’ve experienced loneliness, loss, self-loathing – what does that look like?” So many gardens at Chelsea are designed to be tranquil, comfortable spaces. “I was interested in doing something that was harder, more authentic, something that dealt with conflict or struggle.” Experiences of pain and suffering can transform how you perceive beauty in nature and encourage you to relish the joy in your life. “In our struggle in life, there are moments of absolute bliss when suddenly life, in its pain, is revealed as being so precious.” He cites people living in war-torn parts of the world who take solace from seeing flowers blooming amongst the rubble and destruction. “Plants and garden settings can be places of hope for people in their most distressed time.” Like distressing feelings and conversations, this is a garden you can’t ignore. “At the front, you have to look ahead and assess and think, ‘Am I ready to step into this? Because I can see something beautiful beyond.’” At the end of the twisty, narrow path, past the crowding concrete and prickly thorns, the garden opens up into a welcoming sanctuary. At the back a bench, sculpted into a L-shape, sits under the canopy of a small-leaved elm. It provides a “listening space” where people can “talk, be heard and gain perspective on their struggles”. Hawkes hopes that people who have experienced anxiety, sadness, fear, insecurity and depression will feel “a sense of recognition” when they see the garden, a rare opportunity to openly connect with these negative emotions that is not often offered in public spaces. “We don’t outwardly demonstrate these feelings and experiences, because we’re ashamed of them or we feel they need to be overcome. And when we do overcome them, we don’t really want to revisit them.” His words strike a chord with me. Recently, my mother, Pnina Werbner, died and I am constantly battling immense feelings of loss – particularly in public. I understand exactly what he’s talking about and how isolating such feelings can be. When I have dark thoughts, a common reaction to bereavement, reading poetry about grief has helped me to feel less alone. I ask Hawkes if his garden is intended to be like a poem about loss? “Are you trying to convey that whatever you’re going through, other people do understand – that this garden understands?” “Yes, that’s it,” he says. “Thank you, that’s it.” He shoots me a look of concern, as though my questions disquiet him. He lost two of his friends to suicide when he was in his early 20s and he feels, looking back, that he could have done more. “The signs were there. But I danced tentatively around them when they were alive and depressed and struggling.” He wishes that, for example, he had tried harder to take one friend outside for walks and checked up on him more often. “I phoned him and suggested things but, of course, he was never going to say yes.” With his other friend, he failed to acknowledge how tough things were for her. “I was kind of self-obsessed at the time.” Now, thanks to his training as a Samaritans volunteer, he knows how to listen properly. “Real listening means attending to everything someone tells you. That isn’t just the words they’re using. It’s the pauses between, the shortness of breath, the unsaid things or little clues you might find in a throwaway sentence.” He tries to offer empathy to his callers, he says, not sympathy. “Sympathy can be patronising and condescending and suggest it’s all going to be OK.” Such an approach is not helpful because it is false. By contrast, “Empathy says: ‘I’m here. I’m here with you, alongside you. I don’t pity you. But I’ll sit with you now, and be comfortable with any discomfort I feel.’” He hopes his garden will be an empathetic space for difficult emotional conversations, like the Samaritans helpline. “There’s no danger that by talking about suicide, you’ll encourage somebody to take their own life. In fact, it’s probably the opposite. Sometimes, just giving people the space to be able to talk about their feelings can help.” If visitors do find their emotions are triggered by his garden, he hopes they will leave feeling a sense of pride in their resilience. “I have had times in my life when I’ve been really lonely and lost. And you don’t forget that.” It was a long time ago, he says, when he was a young man, trying to make it in the world and feeling a lot of self-loathing and low self-esteem. He doesn’t often talk about it. “It was horrible and I don’t want to go back there. But I also know that, for years, it gave me a fire in my belly that I drew on every day as a fuel: ‘How can I rise above this struggle? How can I be stronger?’” To convey this difficult emotional journey that many callers to Samaritans must go on, and the difference that time and perspective can make, the back of each rough slab of worthless concrete in Hawkes’s garden has been lovingly polished, carved and inlaid with gold. “As you pass them, you see that the very obstacles which appeared frightening and difficult are actually things that are very precious – things that, on reflection, you might want to hold on to later.” This also serves as an analogy about how precious Samaritans volunteers perceive the lives of their callers to be: “It’s a metaphor about taking people, who consider their life not worth living, and saying, ‘Right now, you’re important enough for me to listen to you. I’m going to listen to everything you tell me. And I care.’” At the end of the interview, he makes a decision. He invites me, quietly, to talk about myself. I tell him about my mum. He listens, and he listens. And I cry. Samaritans Listening Garden, designed by Darren Hawkes, is at Chelsea Flower Show until 27 May.

Those shortages have led to a surge in people growing their own, according to the Royal Horticultural Society, and that trend will be reflected at the Chelsea flower show from 22 May. Those attending the show, put on by the RHS, may be just as likely to see a plump tomato as a symmetrical rose because gardeners are incorporating edible plants into their designs. “We have seen a big increase in interest in growing your own fruit and vegetables, both from our members and people using the RHS website for advice,” said Nikki Barker, a senior horticultural adviser at the RHS. “As well as providing lovely fresh produce to eat at home, it’s likely there are multiple reasons behind more people wanting to grow their own, including recent shortages and higher prices.” Gardens at the show featuring edible plants include the School Food Matters garden, which has child-friendly paths and plants to allow children to forage for their own fresh food. Plants include radishes, beans, beetroot and quince. Two gardens inspired by the one at Chelsea will be relocated to the Alec Reed primary school in Ealing, west London, and The Beacon CE primary school in Liverpool, so children there can experience a kitchen garden filled with fresh fruit and vegetables. Meanwhile, the Restorative Balcony garden will show how to grow edible plants in a small space while providing food for pollinators. Plants include thyme, rosemary and chives. Another aimed at those who have small spaces is the Platform garden, which is inspired by Overground platforms in London, and is supposed to show how urban spaces could be used to grow community food. Crops include tarragon, wild strawberry, mizuna lettuce and sage. First-time Great Pavilion exhibitors Caley Bros are bringing mushrooms to Chelsea and have seen a 500% increase in sales of their grow kits since last year. The London Square Community garden was made in consultation with residents of the Doddington Estate in Battersea, who had created a half-acre community space using donated plants – a green oasis between the tower blocks. Gardeners have chosen a selection of fruit and veg ideally suited to a diverse range of African-Caribbean, Asian and European dishes, reflecting the heritage of those who live in the estate. The garden will be relocated to the Doddington Estate after Chelsea. Sheila Das, a garden manager at RHS Wisley, said that growing your own fruit and vegetables could help people connect more to what they eat. “Growing edibles isn’t just about saving money,” she explained. “It’s about the relationship that you have with your food. The whole of the food production system is quite ugly, and our food isn’t clean, but when you grow it yourself, and you know what’s happened to it, that relationship is brilliant.” Barker advised growing vegetables which have a reliable, heavy crop to make it more cost-effective: “Many plants, including chillis and tomatoes, produce a heavy crop, have many uses and are easy to store, so save money in the long run. There are also benefits for the environment as you have control over chemical usage and can eat more seasonally. “As more and more new varieties come on to the market, including cucamelons and kalettes, growing your own is a really fun way to get gardening, and there is something to suit any space and taste.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/21/readers-reply-why-do-americans-use-the-term-victorian","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T13:00:27Z","webTitle":"Readers reply: why do Americans use the term ‘Victorian’?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/21/readers-reply-why-do-americans-use-the-term-victorian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/21/readers-reply-why-do-americans-use-the-term-victorian","fields":{"headline":"Readers reply: why do Americans use the term ‘Victorian’?","bodyText":"Why do Americans use the term “Victorian”? Victoria came to the British throne in 1837, more than 60 years after the US declared independence. Tim Howell, Newquay Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply One answer is: they do and they don’t. American history that happened along the north Atlantic coast is commonly referred to as taking place “in Victorian times”, but any history that happened west of the Rockies is usually discussed as “in the old west”. Depending on what time in Victoria’s reign is under discussion, history happening in the south-east might be discussed as “in the run-up to the civil war” or “during Reconstruction”. When they do call American history Victorian, the reason is that Americans might have declared independence in the legal sense, but at the time the British empire was still far and away the most important political entity in the English-speaking world. American literature, social mores, fashion, theatre, industry, science and politics were all deeply shaped on a daily basis by what was happening in London. Especially during the run of weak, corrupt presidents during the Gilded Age, it was more useful and intuitive for Americans to refer to what they thought of as the centre of civilisation. catseyemousehole I recall being surprised to hear San Francisco’s Painted Ladies being described as Victorian. The reason may be that the city wasn’t the old west, but settled in part by Europeans - not necessarily British - who had arrived by ship rather than by wagon train across the continent. jno50 Generally speaking, in the US, we use the term Victorian for events, both historical and cultural, that occurred during her reign. During that period, there were 18 US presidents, who were in office for between six months and eight years, so one can hardly define these timeframes as an era. Also, considering nearly a quarter of the population were subjects of the British empire at that time, I imagine that it became a relatively commonly understood term. Peridot Because it’s shorthand for the bulk of the 19th century, even in Europe. Victoria’s reign was so long and saw so many changes – and not just in Britain or the British colonies. She was also probably the last head of state to project a global image for so long. Plus, Victorian is an architectural, fashion and artistic style. AliHargreaves61 As a term to describe the art and architecture of an era, it’s an easier umbrella term than the vast range of international ornate styles that were popular during Victoria’s reign: all the revival styles such as pre-Raphaelite, neo-gothic, neo-Byzantine, Arts and Crafts etc. Its other meanings – prudishness, hypocrisy, or a society where enormous poverty exists alongside extreme wealth – are sadly as relevant to certain quarters of American and British society today as they were in the 19th century. appealforsanity I don’t know that it’s used very much at all in many parts of the US, but generally it’s in reference to a style of architecture or design, possibly certain fashions. Certainly, in the north-east, there would in this era still be a great deal of direct trade and interaction between Britain and the US, and quite a lot of cross-pollination, so to speak, particularly among wealthier families, in terms of sending their adult children (sons, mainly) either east or west across the ditch for purposes of education, apprenticeship and oversight of family businesses, cementing of social connections. shangers Most Americans who use the adjective Victorian apply it to literature (especially British literature), and do so accurately to place it in time, or to an aesthetic reminiscent of the time. The vast majority of Americans never use the term at all. There are many reasons for this. The most palatable one: literature classes for American children are (despite what you may read about the authoritarian censorship horrors in Florida) increasingly inclusive, with an effort to read more women, non-heterosexual, non-white writers. quiettess Progressive/leftwing north-east American here. I think when it is used – not very often, where I’m from – the term we’re searching for is “puritan”. Quips like: “That’s so Victorian,” are very casual, fleeting and so vaguely refer to a time that we assume was much less progressive for women and brutal in many ways, for example the ways diseases and surgeries were handled. barndotghost We will talk about Victorian attitudes or morals in reference to American mores, but it’s often a bit derogatory, as in a fondness for covering table limbs with fabric. And refusing to acknowledge that tables and chairs have legs. AspasiasUli We use Victorian to label a set of social mores that we believe were prominent in the British Empire during the mid-19th century, and that “better” American society emulated. It stands in contrast to modernity, the contrast captured by Cole Porter: In olden days, a glimpse of stocking Was looked on as something shocking But now, God knows Anything goes.” 1cjcarpenter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/treasury-analysing-whether-removal-of-tampon-tax-has-lowered-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T13:00:27Z","webTitle":"Concerns over price rises for period products despite removal of tampon tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/treasury-analysing-whether-removal-of-tampon-tax-has-lowered-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/treasury-analysing-whether-removal-of-tampon-tax-has-lowered-prices","fields":{"headline":"Concerns over price rises for period products despite removal of tampon tax","bodyText":"The Treasury is analysing whether the removal of the “tampon tax” – trumpeted last week by Rishi Sunak as one of the benefits of Brexit – has helped lower prices at all, amid concerns the saving is not being passed on by retailers to women. Responding to a written question from the Labour MP Ruth Cadbury, the government said a tax reduction was able to “contribute to the conditions for price reductions” and it was “looking into whether this important zero-rating is being passed on by retailers to women as intended”. Sunak scrapped the 5% VAT rate on tampons when he was chancellor, with the change kicking in on 1 January 2021. Last year, the Guardian reported stores were thought to have banked £10m a year from the tax change. A new snapshot for the last 12 months shows prices have risen again, in many cases by much more than the 10% rate of inflation. A pack of 20 supermarket own-label tampons is now £1.16, up from 91p a year ago. This works out as a 27% increase, based on the average price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons, according to the data firm Assosia. Meanwhile, at £2.38 for a pack of 18, a box of Tampax Compak Super Plus tampons costs 35p, 17% more than in May 2022. When it comes to pads, a pack of eight to 10 Bodyform Ultra Goodnight pads costs 21p – or 16% – more at £1.51, while a 14-pack of Always Sensitive is up by 3p at 98p. Some products are cheaper. The price of a 14-pack of supermarket own-label ultra regular pads is down by 3p to 63p. Laura Coryton, who started the Stop Taxing Periods campaign that helped bring about the policy change, said the 300,000 people who signed her petition to end tampon tax “wanted to make period products more accessible”. “They didn’t want to make supermarkets richer.” Coryton has started a new petition calling on retailers to pass on any savings from the tampon tax to women. On his way to the G7 summit, Sunak cited cheaper period products and beer – a new alcohol duty regime will come into being this summer – as among the “very tangible benefits of Brexit”. However, in the past year the cost of nearly everything, including beer and tampons, has gone up. Cadbury suggested his comments showed “how out of touch he is about the cost of living crisis”, adding the rising cost of period products is “having a huge impact”. Researchers at the not-for-profit advisory firm Tax Policy Associates, which produced research last year showing how retailers benefited, compared tampon price changes with those of 13 similar products, including tissues and nappies, for several years before the tax was removed and up until March 2022, when inflation started to accelerate. Its founder, Dan Neidle, said its analysis showed that, at most, tampon prices were cut by about 1%, with the majority of the benefit, worth about £10m a year, retained by retailers. Neidle suggested that if you wanted to make a vital product more affordable to people on lower incomes it was “much better to distribute it free to those in need than cut VAT”. “Otherwise we’re just using taxpayer funds to boost retailers’ profits.” A government spokesperson said: “Having left the EU, we have kept our promise to scrap the tampon tax to make sanitary products more affordable. We urge retailers to pass the savings on to shoppers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/21/artist-hurvin-anderson-royal-academy-salon-paintings-hepworth-wakefield-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T13:00:27Z","webTitle":"Artist Hurvin Anderson: ‘I’m always nervous about the word identity.

I try not to use it’","bodyText":"Hurvin Anderson lives and works in the middle of nowhere. His wife, Alice (also his studio manager), has to pick me up from the station because taxis can never find the place. Their Cambridgeshire home, which they share with their three young children, is the kind that “home inspiration” Instagram accounts would eat up. It has a spiral staircase, expansive windows looking out on to endless greenery and a room that is an actual circle. Next door to the large property is Anderson’s equally impressive purpose-built studio on land where an old farm building once sat. “It’s just somewhere to work,” Anderson says in a rather humble manner for an artist once described by the Turner prize judges (he was nominated in 2017) as “an outstanding British painter whose art speaks to our current political moment with questions about identity and belonging”. Anderson used to have a studio in south London but the travelling back and forth became too time-consuming. Still, he has a love-hate relationship with the new one. “It’s a bit too close to home,” he says. “But I’m able to work in longer spells. It was hard getting back from London. It became impractical with the kids.” We sit in the bright airy studio surrounded by objects – plants, sketches of figures, a map of Jamaica, mirrors, posters and paintings in progress. Anderson talks slowly and in a way that reads as nervous, but he’s warm and smiley and thinks carefully about his responses. He is wearing jeans and a dark blue hoodie and, at 58, has the face of someone much younger; a greying beard and are the only signs of his age. He’s been making art for 25 years and has exhibited all over the world, including, in recent years, in two major British group shows: Tate Britain’s Life Between Islands and the touring exhibition British Art Show 9. Just last week he was named a Royal Academician and now, he’s getting ready for his own exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield entitled Salon Paintings. On show will be work from his best known series depicting barbershops, a selection of his drawings and more experimental work, plus a room curated by Anderson of work by British painters including Michael Andrews, Sonia Boyce and Denzil Forrester. So what is the fascination with barbershops? Anderson began painting them in 2007 after his father took him to a Jamaican barbershop in a converted attic in Birmingham. “When I first saw the space, it was actually more about the mirrors. I walked in. It was quite still. Guys were waiting. People were cutting hair. Then you’d turn around 90 degrees and there’s two mirrors behind you. It’s an odd atmosphere to work in. To have so much reflection. To see yourself constantly.” He took photographs of the salon and used them as a basis for his colourful, semi-abstract works, featuring, variously, figures, barber’s chairs, bottles, machines, and walls of mirrors and posters. The imagery found on barbershop walls fascinated him too. “Hairstyles, of course, but also football teams, newspaper articles. It gave another twist somehow. “A lot has been said about the conversations that go on in barbershops,” he adds, and incorporating the posters “was a way of bringing these conversations into the paintings.” The colours and aesthetic of the barbershops, he tells me, were a way for those from the Caribbean to feel more at home in England. Talking about his actual childhood home, he says, “There’s a photograph of [the interior of] our house and it’s just wood. My dad had gotten this wooden wallpaper. I never knew why until I went to Jamaica and saw some of the places that people lived in. I thought: ‘Oh. It’s a way of bringing some of that back here.’” * * * Anderson was born in Handsworth, an inner-city area in Birmingham, in 1965. His mother was a seamstress, his father a welder, and they had migrated to the UK from Jamaica as part of the Windrush generation. Hurvin was the youngest of eight children and the only one to be born in England. His family were supportive of his creativity. His mother put his drawings up around the house. “They didn’t say no,” he says. “I knew other people around who were creative, so it wasn’t frowned upon.” After school he didn’t pursue an art career straight away, trying his hand at other things first. One of them was setting up a recording studio but, he reflects, “when something isn’t for you, the routes never seem open to you”; another was doing graphic design projects and painting murals around Birmingham with a couple of friends on the Enterprise Allowance scheme (a Margaret Thatcher initiative that gave £40 a week (equivalent to earnings of about £150 a week today) to unemployed people to set up their own business). When that didn’t work out he spent a year working as a surveyor, measuring up premises and calculating their property tax, but he was starting to think about doing an art foundation course. He was 25 by the time he enrolled at Birmingham Polytechnic. “I had a friend called Brian and we were doing an illustration course. He said to me: ‘I think you’re more of a fine artist than an illustrator.’” That was the trigger for Anderson, who went on to study at the Wimbledon College of Art and the Royal College of Art. As well as the barbershop paintings, Anderson is known for his vibrant landscape works. These rapturous scenes of greens and blues draw on an idea of the Caribbean that is part reality, part imagination. “You heard so much about these places when you were growing up. You wanted to experience it. You oddly feel like you know it more than you know Britain,” he says. “I’m always nervous about the word identity. I try not to use it, but I’m fascinated with owning somewhere, or feeling like somewhere is yours. I live in the countryside but have not yet found a way to be drawn into the landscape here. Whereas when I go to Jamaica or the Caribbean, there’s a bit of me that wants to bring it back.” It’s partly the distance that keeps Anderson returning to the Caribbean in his work. “When it’s further away, it’s more interesting. There’s a romance to it.” In 2021, Anderson exhibited an arresting new series depicting an abandoned hotel complex in Jamaica at Thomas Dane Gallery in London. The paintings show geometric concrete structures overwhelmed by forestation. His preoccupation with these ruined landscapes began in 2017 when he and his wife and young children were on a beach in Jamaica “releasing turtles” and suddenly noticed some abandoned buildings. “We walked to this beach that was slightly inhospitable. You could hear the rushing of the sea against the hills and the shear of the rock. We walked along and saw these disused hotels.” The buildings were overgrown with greenery but further on, they could see that new hotels were also being built. “They didn’t even bother to knock the old ones down. They just left them there.” These deserted hotels represent the fallacy of paradise and speak to the exoticism and tourism that plagues Jamaica. “When I was very young, I would stay with my sister. But when people go back [to Jamaica] now, they don’t stay with family. They go to resorts. It does feel like a shift.” Still, he found a certain beauty in these abandoned sites. “I was interested in that clash between nature and the modern. All of these concrete structures, and then nature taking it back.” There was a sense, he says, of, “‘You can do what you like for now, but we’ll take it all back.’” Looking at Anderson’s work, it’s clear that he wants to evoke feelings rather than convey facts. “For me, there was always something false about the photorealistic,” he says. “Each time [I paint], I want to acknowledge to the viewer that this is made up. There is truth in there, but also elements of fiction.” When it comes to his materials and techniques, Anderson typically starts with acrylic and then works on top with oil. “I enjoy the spontaneity of acrylics. They dry quickly. You can move quickly. I want that speed. You want to be able to play a little and move things around. But you can find yourself getting too involved in the painting, because you can do so much. Oils are a different creature,” he says. “I see why historically, it’s the thing to conquer. You have to be much more sure.” * * * Anderson’s career is a working-class success story; his achievements a feat many would have deemed impossible. I ask if he’s considered “special” in his family and he rejects the notion immediately. “No. I think everyone is a success in their own right,” he says, referring to his siblings. Many of them are now retired, but one works as a carpenter, another in nursing, and another is a chef in a school. He says his success is also partly down to the era when he started out. Higher university fees and higher living costs are only some of the deterrents stopping young people from pursuing a career in art today. I bring up Structurally F–cked, a report published by Industria and a-n (the Artists Information Company) in March, which calculated that artists who responded to their survey and had been contracted to deliver projects by publicly funded galleries in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland for a fixed sum were being paid a median income of just £2.60 per hour. “I wonder, if I was coming through now – would I have taken that leap?” says Anderson. “Your rent might have been expensive [back then], but maybe travel was cheap. You would work part-time and you were able to cover [your outgoings]. You weren’t able to save but you could make a living, whereas now, I’m not sure if that holds.” Arguably, things are slowly changing in terms of race and representation in the art world. Lubaina Himid won the Turner prize in 2017, the year Anderson was also nominated; and Sonia Boyce represented the UK at the Venice Biennale in 2022. But the landscape was very white even just 10 years ago. “Then, you’d look around and see that the music industry was there for Black people as a way to get through. In terms of fine art [that wasn’t the case]. But we were here and we had a voice.” The rise of the British Black Arts Movement and the landmark 1989 exhibition The Other Story (which featured work by Himid, Frank Bowling and Rasheed Araeen and transferred from the Hayward to Wolverhampton Art Gallery in 1990) were pivotal moments for him. “Those were quite key small bombs going off in terms of possibility.” Still, the heights that Anderson has reached today were unimaginable to him back then. In 2021, his painting Audition, depicting a large swimming pool scene and painted in 1998, sold for £7.4m – five times its estimate. It became the fourth most expensive painting ever sold by a living Black artist. “You kind of tune out in a way,” he says referring to his groundbreaking sales, but “I don’t want to pretend that I’m not aware.” One might imagine that Anderson received a fat cheque off the back of that sale, but that wasn’t the case. In the UK, an artist gets royalties on a sliding scale that starts at 4% for a resale of up to £50,000, and decreases to 0.25% when the price exceeds £500,000, with a ceiling of £12,500 on the total payment. “It’s the market,” he says. “You make paintings. You make work for the ideas. But then there’s the business. And that’s where everything can get murky.” His new exhibition isn’t about that side of art. It’s a chance for him to explore his obsessions with the pastoral, and also, play with his approach to mark-making. “I use colour as quite a practical way to mark out the space – like with this pink and light blue,” he says, indicating a large painting featuring two men getting their hair cut, which will be the centrepiece of the Hepworth show, where he has used these two colours to differentiate between the mirror and the wall. His methods are influenced by the likes of William Coldstream and Euan Uglow, British painters who used colour in a similar way. Anderson’s approach to art feels both honest and earnest. His approach to his home life seems similar. When I ask what he does in his spare time, his reply is very wholesome. “It’s basically the kids.” He’s got an older daughter too, he tells me. “And I’ve got grandkids.” He paints with the young ones sometimes, but not too often. “I’m trying to steer them away,” he laughs. “There’s lots of other things out there that we should be doing.” Hurvin Anderson: Salon Paintings is at the Hepworth Wakefield from 26 May to 5 Nov, then will tour to Hastings Contemporary (17 Nov to 3 Mar 2024) and Kistefos, Norway in spring/summer 2024"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/21/hyperfatigue-is-the-big-thing-in-2023-but-what-we-really-need-are-50-words-for-tired","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T13:00:26Z","webTitle":"Yes, you’re tired.

But are you hungry tired, angry tired, resignation tired, stupid tired …?","bodyText":"A new tiredness has dropped. According to the market researchers Mintel, 2023 is the year of “hyperfatigue” – which seems to describe a state of continual physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. It’s nice of them to enrich our weariness one-upmanship with this concept, even if it sounds like something a French teenager would have said in the 90s; my computer even keeps trying to add an accent. But they aren’t wrong: tiredness – possibly, yes, hyperfatigue – is the malaise of our age. Everywhere is too light and too loud to sleep properly, and our animal brains are overwhelmed by rolling news of hundreds of global atrocities and dangers, TikTok, deepfakes and monitoring 48 WhatsApp groups. In a recent survey, 35% of people said they were too tired to make healthy changes to their diet and activity levels, suggesting many are in a vicious circle of fatigue-induced self-sabotage, leading to more fatigue. We’re too tired to tackle our tiredness, basically. But surely there must be better ways to describe what we’re experiencing? One word shouldn’t cover everything from a 50-mile bike ride, to five teething night feeds, to soul-crushing world-weariness. “Tired” is doing too much heavy lifting: used as a proxy for a whole paint chart of feelings, it’s going to tire itself out. We need 50 words for tired, expressing specific granular variations, and we need the geniuses who come up with nail varnish colour names to invent them, not market researchers: give me expressive; give me apposite. Here are some of the types of tiredness I want words for – and possibly colour-coded lanyards, which could spare us all a lot of strife. Heavy tired: Your face is sagging off your skull; your mouth has become stuck slightly open and you’re not strong enough to close it again, allowing a thin line of drool to escape intermittently. Your head is a cannonball, your eyelids little sandbags from which sand dribbles, foreshadowing your death. Your teeth are lead and even your hair feels heavy. Anxious tired: The only executive function still available to you is catastrophising: you’re getting fired; terrible things have befallen your loved ones; your partner is breaking up with you. Your fingers tingle with dread opening every email, even one from a deodorant brand saying they miss you, so here’s a 10% discount with code PIT10. Existentially tired: You’re only saying “I am so tired” because the English language doesn’t give you adequate ways to express your profound existential malaise. Jean-Paul Sartre would understand. Skinned-alive tired: It feels as if someone has taken a kitchen scourer to every inch of you, then kicked you downstairs. Everything is an assault: a ringing phone, ordering coffee, the printer (admittedly printers are an assault even after eight hours of dreamless sleep). Your own breathing is unbearable. You’d cry, but tears would feel too awful on your raw, bloodshot eyeballs. Hungry tired: Ideally, someone would make you a pillow, possibly a whole duvet, of carbs, but you’re forced to make do with anything you can cram into the toaster. Later you find yourself impatiently microwaving a kilo bag of oven chips and eating them still half frozen. Dessert is everything, including a box of coconut macaroons – best before: Jan 2012 – to which you may be allergic (you no longer care). Stupid tired: Your brain has been replaced with a single dried pea. Whee, listen to it roll! Angry tired: If your day had a soundtrack, it would be screaming Finnish death metal. You give off an aura of such unhinged rage that everyone tiptoes around you like you’re unexploded second world war ordnance. That just makes you angrier. Twin Peaks tired: Every place, person and task you encounter feels like a fairground ride designed by David Lynch. Someone asks you a simple question, but what comes out of your mouth sounds like Edward Lear, recited from inside a bowl of jelly. Everything is absurd: these are what, fingers? A “fork”? “Microsoft Excel”? Nope, meaningless. Resignation tired: If AI could take your job, you’d greet it with sobbing gratitude and helpful handover notes. That was today’s version here, but unfortunately AI didn’t show up, so you’re stuck with me. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It had felt as if every one of 10,000 roaring souls in the sold-out crowd was against Cameron and supporting Katie Taylor as she finally fought at home in Ireland for the first time in her professional career. Cameron’s face was bruised but she smiled as she absorbed the scale of her achievement in remaining the undisputed super-lightweight champion of the world after narrowly defeating Taylor in an enthralling contest. It was Taylor’s first defeat since turning pro in 2016 and Cameron deserves immense credit for beating a magnificent champion who had craved a successful homecoming. At the outset, Cameron’s nerve was examined like never before. But the 32-year-old from Northampton shook her head when it was suggested she must have felt very lonely in those moments when resounding booing for her was replaced by an exultant celebration of Taylor. The quiet woman from down the road in Bray walked slowly to the ring. Cameron stressed how calm she had felt and then, with a shrug, said: “It’s just noise. That’s all – noise. As soon as that bell goes, I do what I do.” Could she hear that deafening noise, which seemed to barely subside, once the fight began? There was another shake of the head. “It’s tunnel vision.” Her concentration had been so absolute that Cameron admitted she was unsure how the fight was being scored. In the end two judges gave the decision to her by six rounds to four, while the third saw it as a draw. “It was hard to call because when I’m fighting I’m not thinking how many rounds I’m winning,” Cameron said. “It’s just tunnel vision, throwing my hands and getting the job done.” When the draw was announced first, Cameron was “worried”. Her trainer, Jamie Moore, said: “I had it 7-3 but you can’t complain they scored it 6-4. I thought the draw was harsh.” Taylor, the undisputed lightweight champion, had called out Cameron in a bold move to set up the fight. Cameron is the champion in the weight class above and she is nearly five years younger than Taylor, with a three-inch advantage in both height and reach. “Katie definitely had the speed,” Cameron said of the many times when Taylor caught her with fast hands, “but I was the bigger girl with the heavier punches.” It was a typically pithy appraisal from Cameron, who prefers fighting to talking. Taylor, who turns 37 in July, has been exceptional for years but brutal fights have drained her. Cameron was right to stress that Taylor had “definitely” given her the hardest fight of her career. “Katie is a great fighter and great ambassador for the sport. You can’t help but respect her. She’s a nice woman, a great athlete, a great boxer and she has influenced so many.” Cameron lacks the understated charisma of Taylor, who has a nation behind her, and it is doubtful if even Northampton is agog after the champion’s seismic victory so far from home. Even amid the euphoria, Cameron looked embarrassed when asked if she is now the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. “She’s too modest,” Moore said. Modesty is not a word associated with Eddie Hearn, who promoted the contest and has been in Taylor’s corner since she turned pro. The rematch is simmering in Hearn’s mind and he pointed to Cameron. “She’s just beaten the pound-for-pound No 1.” “Exactly,” Moore said. “If Katie was the pound-for-pound No 1, which I believe she was, then surely this makes Chantelle the world’s new pound-for-pound No 1.” Claressa Shields, however, occupies that role. The American is the best female fighter on the planet. She also has charisma to burn and an extraordinary personal story. Cameron won’t be bothered by that. She knows she will never match Shields as an electrifying presence. Cameron also accepts she is very different to Taylor, who has inspired a country. Hearn praised Cameron for “never playing the victim” and understanding that “Katie was the star” in the buildup. Cameron had accepted that, even as the defending champion, she would walk to the ring first, for she was convinced she would beat Taylor. “The biggest fight in women’s boxing right now is Taylor-Cameron II,” Hearn said. “So we’ll find a way.” Cameron agreed. “Katie’s such a great boxer she’s going to want the rematch.” And then, even through her voice still sounded more muted than elated, Cameron added one last telling sentence to stress her new authority. “But now it’s on my terms.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2023/may/21/ladbrokes-owner-entain-dishonest-lobbying-gambling-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T12:47:42Z","webTitle":"Ladbrokes owner funded ‘dishonest’ lobbying against gambling reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/21/ladbrokes-owner-entain-dishonest-lobbying-gambling-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/21/ladbrokes-owner-entain-dishonest-lobbying-gambling-reforms","fields":{"headline":"Ladbrokes owner funded ‘dishonest’ lobbying against gambling reforms","bodyText":"The owner of Ladbrokes, Entain, has been accused of “dishonest” lobbying after it funded an operation mobilising people to complain to their MP about proposals to change gambling laws. The government last month unveiled plans for tighter regulation, including measures it said would make gambling safer but would also reduce revenue for brands such as Coral and PartyCasino, owned by Entain. At the time, Entain’s chief executive, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, said the company welcomed “an important step towards having a robust regulatory framework that is fit for the digital age and creates a level playing field for all operators”. But emails seen by the Guardian indicate that, despite supporting the white paper in public, Entain was funding a lobbying operation designed to water it down or overturn it. Days after the white paper was published, an organisation called the Players’ Panel, which claims to represent the interests of ordinary gamblers, wrote to people who had signed up to receive information about its work. “The government has decided to limit when and how much you can bet,” said the email. “This is going to significantly impact your ability to bet responsibly.” The Players’ Panel then urged the recipients to write to their MP opposing the reforms. As the Guardian has revealed previously, the group is funded and managed by Entain. At no point in the emails did the group disclose this, although the company’s name can be found on the group’s website. Members of the group who were invited to write to their MP were then provided with 10 letter templates, some targeted at individual elements of the government’s gambling white paper. One template referred to “a massive infringement on my personal freedom” and suggested that the MP could take up the issue with the gambling minister, Lucy Frazer. “It isn’t fair, it isn’t right and it isn’t British,” another concluded. Other templates ask MPs to intervene to stop specific proposals such as limits on online slot machine stakes, tougher affordability checks designed to prevent unsustainable losses and restrictions on “free” spins. The templates describe the white paper as a “negative step” that would “do more harm than good”, apparently contradicting Entain’s public stance on the proposals. Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party parliamentary group on gambling harm, said the lobbying effort was “shameful”. “These emails reveal their true colours as they immediately try to undermine the proposals using covert and dishonest tactics.” Lady Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: “Of course it’s legitimate for the public to lobby MPs on upcoming legislation. “But for members of parliament – and members of the public – to be kept in the dark over which well-funded gambling firm is behind lobbying efforts such as template emails is pretty underhand. In fact, it stinks.” A former leader of the Conservative party, Iain Duncan Smith, said the distribution of email templates showed a “level of dishonesty”. “At no stage do these emails point out that it’s a lobbying exercise by a company,” he added. “They’re trying to hide behind constituents rather than coming clean about their own self-interest.” Entain refused to say how much of the Players’ Panel funding it provided and whether any of its staff were involved in writing the templates. It said in a statement: “It is hugely important that everyday punters have an active say in the consultation process that has been launched as part of the Gambling Act review, and especially those elements of the review that could impact a recreational past-time [sic] that is enjoyed by millions of people across the country. “We do not see any contradiction between our welcoming of the review and our encouragement of our customers to make their voices heard in what is an important and necessary debate.” Entain added that members of the Players’ Panel, some of whom have written articles about gambling regulation on the group’s website, were unpaid volunteers who did not receive any benefit from the company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/labour-accused-of-meddling-after-vetoing-local-authority-coalition-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T12:37:31Z","webTitle":"Labour accused of meddling after vetoing local authority coalition plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/labour-accused-of-meddling-after-vetoing-local-authority-coalition-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/labour-accused-of-meddling-after-vetoing-local-authority-coalition-plans","fields":{"headline":"Labour accused of meddling after vetoing local authority coalition plans","bodyText":"Labour faces accusations of overcentralised meddling after the party’s national executive vetoed planned coalitions with the Liberal Democrats or Greens in a series of formerly Conservative-held local authorities. While it is longstanding Labour policy that local parties need a green light from the national executive committee (NEC) before forming coalitions, some activists say attempts to block deals risk allowing Conservatives to regain control instead. In one council, Hertsmere, just north of London, where the Tories lost power for the first time since 1999 in this month’s elections, Labour councillors are threatening to sit as independents if the NEC continues to veto a deal with the Lib Dems. “This has been a Tory area for the last 24 years, and we’ve worked so hard to change that,” one local Labour source in the Hertfordshire district said. “It’s quite insulting now to be told we can’t get the benefits.” A similar stalemate at Cherwell council in Oxfordshire, where the NEC is refusing to allow the Labour group to govern with the Lib Dems and Greens, has prompted speculation it could end up returning to Tory control. There have been similar vetoes at two other formerly Conservative-run local authorities that are now in no overall control, Lewes in East Sussex and Canterbury in Kent. Several local Labour sources told the Guardian they believed the party was being overly rigid and interventionist. It comes after the NEC announced it would appoint the next leader of Birmingham council, following an internal report that said the Labour group was riven by factions. In a notably positive set of local election results on 4 May, Labour won control of 22 new councils, with a further 12 shifting to no overall control, many having previously been Conservative-run. Among the latter group was Hertsmere, where from the Tories’ pre-election position of holding 29 of the 39 council seats they plummeted to 16, fewer than the combined total of 14 for Labour and nine Lib Dems. But plans for a Labour-Lib Dem coalition are in deadlock after the NEC vetoed it over apparent claims about a pre-election pact between the parties, something rejected by local Labour sources. A number of Labour councillors are understood to be considering resigning from the party to sit as independents if the NEC does not back down. In Cherwell, formerly the last Conservative-run council in Oxfordshire, the Tories’ post-election total of 20 councillors is fewer than the 12 for Labour, 10 Lib Dems and three Greens. But plans for a coalition are at a stalemate after the NEC refused to allow the local Labour party to sign up to a deal with both the Lib Dems and Greens. A Labour source said the party’s policy was to make pacts with the fewest number of parties needed to form a majority. The complication in Cherwell is that the Lib Dems and Greens, as well as one independent councillor, are grouped into the so-called Progressive Oxfordshire Alliance, and so will not accept the NEC’s insistence on a Lib Dem-only deal. A first meeting of the new council removed the existing Tory leader but could not agree a replacement. One council source said that if the NEC did not back down the Conservatives might govern as a minority: “The Tories in charge again isn’t what people voted for, but there has to be an administration at some point.” In Lewes, the Greens, who became the biggest party after an election in which the Tories were wiped out, say their plans for an all-party administration involving both the Lib Dems and Labour had reached agreement but was blocked by Labour’s NEC. Labour councillors in Canterbury, where they are the biggest party, have been allowed to govern with the Lib Dems, but the NEC stopped the participation of the Greens. Neal Lawson, the head of the cross-party campaign group Compass, called for the party to show more flexibility. He said: “No Labour councillors should be blocked from forming anti-Tory alliances. Protecting the interests of local voters must come before party tribalism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/21/facebook-to-be-fined-648m-for-mishandling-user-information","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T12:36:10Z","webTitle":"Facebook to be fined £648m for mishandling user information","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/21/facebook-to-be-fined-648m-for-mishandling-user-information","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/21/facebook-to-be-fined-648m-for-mishandling-user-information","fields":{"headline":"Facebook to be fined £648m for mishandling user information","bodyText":"Facebook is to be fined more than €746m (£648m) and ordered to suspend data transfers to the US as an Irish regulator prepares to punish the social media network for its handling of user information. The fine, first reported by Bloomberg and expected to be confirmed as soon as Monday, will set a record for a breach of the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), beating the €746m levied on Amazon by Luxembourg in 2021. The decision by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which is the lead privacy regulator for Facebook and its owner Meta across the EU, is also expected to pause transfers of data from Facebook’s European users to the US. The ruling is unlikely to take effect immediately. Meta is expected to be given a grace period to comply with the decision, which could push any suspension into the autumn, and the company is expected to appeal against the decision. The ruling relates to a legal challenge brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that European users’ data is not sufficiently protected from US intelligence agencies when it is transferred across the Atlantic. Writing in 2020, Meta’s policy chief, Nick Clegg, said suspending data transfers on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) – a mechanism used by Facebook and others – could have “a far-reaching effect on businesses that rely on SCCs and on the online services many people and businesses rely on”. In Meta’s most recent quarterly results, the company said that without SCCs or “other alternative means of data transfers” it would “likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe”. Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a campaigner for stronger protection of internet users’ data, said a financial punishment exceeding €746m would not be enough if Facebook did not fundamentally change its user data-reliant business model. “A billion-euro parking ticket is of no consequence to a company that earns many more billions by parking illegally,” he said. The Irish data watchdog has fined Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, a total of nearly €1bn since September 2021. It also regulates Apple, Google, TikTok and other technology platforms whose EU headquarters are in Ireland. In November last year, Meta was fined €265m (£230m) by the watchdog after a breach that resulted in the details of more than 500 million users being published online. That came weeks after a €405m fine for letting teenagers set up Instagram accounts that publicly displayed their phone numbers and email addresses. Any suspension would be rendered meaningless if the US and EU implement a new data transfer agreement, which has been agreed at a political level. A Meta spokesperson said: “This case relates to a historic conflict of EU and US law, which is in the process of being resolved via the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework. We welcome the progress that policymakers have made towards ensuring the continued transfer of data across borders and await the regulator’s final decision on this matter.” The latest problems for Meta emerged after the group reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue last month of $28bn. Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, has been attempting to shift away from social media and develop the metaverse – its virtual reality program. The billions spent on those efforts caused concern among investors as Meta has also struggled to compete with the rise of TikTok, which has proved particularly popular among younger people. The company, meanwhile, has made mass layoffs as part of a planned “year of efficiency” that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, announced in February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2023/may/21/jess-phillips-interview-homes-health-birmingham-lunch-chippy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T12:00:26Z","webTitle":"Jess Phillips: ‘People rely on someone they love to die to afford a place to live’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/21/jess-phillips-interview-homes-health-birmingham-lunch-chippy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2023/may/21/jess-phillips-interview-homes-health-birmingham-lunch-chippy","fields":{"headline":"Jess Phillips: ‘People now rely on someone they love to die so they can afford somewhere to live’","bodyText":"Bedders is a precinct fish and chip shop beside a busy traffic island in Small Heath in Birmingham. It is not quite in Jess Phillips’s constituency, but she hopes she might claim it in the next round of boundary changes. Sitting in its back room, with a plate of cod, chips and mushy peas and a cup of builder’s tea in front of her, the MP is explaining to me why she feels she has a family stake in the place. “My nan and grandad lived round the corner,” she says. “And we would always come here when I was growing up. After my nan died at 92 in 2005, Grandad Fred – her second husband – would come and do his shopping at Asda over the road and then in here for his dinner. They would look after him. He’d been wounded in Burma during the war, but was fit as anything – in his 80s, he’d be up a ladder, always in his suit and tie, clearing his gutters. One time though, crossing the road to here, he was knocked down by a car and shattered his pelvis. After that, one particular woman, Janet, who used to work here, if she hadn’t seen him for a few days would take a bag of chips round to his house and check he was all right. When he died, he had a little bit of money left in his savings and he left a third of it to Bedders fish and chip shop and to Janet.” Phillips is, understandably, therefore right at home here. While we eat, a few people come over to give her a thumbs up, or to wonder if she can help with parking issues or anxieties about housing or schools or health. She knows their stories, speaks their language. Watching her in action, even over lunch, is to have your faith restored in what big-hearted, plain-speaking local representation might look like. “I never wanted to just be a Labour MP,” she tells me. “I wanted to be the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley. The only good bit of my job is this bit. It is the thing that gives you life for the rest of it.” She doesn’t doubt that MPs can be effective in places other than where they grew up, but she has a head start. “I always start in the middle of the conversation.” She’s on an Easter break from parliament. Getting enthusiastically stuck into her chips, she suggests April is the cruellest month for her always on-off diet regimes. It’s not only a cupboard full of chocolate eggs, but also Ramadan, which in her patch means a round of invites to fast-breaking Iftar suppers at sundown. “This time of year I tend to put on a ton of weight,” she says, “because I’m obviously not fasting, but still eating a massive dinner every night. Tonight it’s the Bangladeshi community. I was on no carbs the first night of Ramadan, but the school I was at made such an effort and the food was so good, it seemed rude not to.” Come Eid, she insists, she is back on a thousand calories a day. I know her area a bit myself. My own grandparents also lived a mile away, and my parents met when they worked in the offices of the now demolished Lucas factory which once employed about half of Phillips’s constituents. We compare notes on the changes. In many ways, the city centre has had a major “glow up” in recent years, Phillips says, with redevelopment and the (distant) prospect of HS2, but the effects haven’t been felt this far from it. What she has heard from people visiting her weekly surgery in the past couple of years is more extreme than anything she’d known before. “There’s always been some serious poverty around here,” she says. “But the Yardley my parents grew up in is completely different to the situation now. My mum’s mum was a single mother dinner lady. But my mum went off to university and they didn’t lie awake worrying about how to pay the bills. My dad’s dad was a postman. I used to think that they were rich, mainly because they had a hostess trolley with a hunting scene on it. There was never much money, but they had a council house and stability.” Now, she says, housing has become an endemic problem, with knock-on effects for health, crime and employment. “There are thousands of families on every waiting list. Evictions are back after the pandemic with a vengeance. You can still buy a big Victorian house round here for under 200 grand. Private landlords whack them full of vulnerable people, and the taxpayer pays for the consequences.” But in common with the crises in health and criminal justice and education, none of this gets any interest at all from the government. “They can bring in three or four bills about how loud you can shout at a protest,” she says, “but the fact that £100m of taxpayers money, just in Birmingham, is being spent on this terrible exploitative accommodation never gets a mention.” Phillips, like all gifted politicians, moves in and out of this kind of outrage easily. She never forgets that life has its lightness as well as its struggles. She grew up in a Labour household – her dad was a teacher, her mum was an NHS administrator who became chair of South Birmingham mental health trust. The youngest of four, she insisted on going to grammar school, against her parents’ principles. “At the time I think my dad was so pissed off with the Tory government bringing in the national curriculum that they thought ‘sod it’. And also I was absolutely determined. I liked taking tests.” She married her boyfriend from school, a lift engineer, and had the first of her two sons at 22. She talks in cheerful bursts about her family. “My husband likes building things,” she says, with a smile. “His idea of a hot date might still be to take me to a ball-bearing factory, or a place where they make casters. He knows how to treat a lady.” A prime ambition of her sons, she suggests, is to feed her false information, that she might trot out on Question Time. “They will tell me the cost of living crisis means they have no Bunsen burners at school,” she says. “Things that are not true. My eldest son recently altered my Wikipedia page to say I liked to eat Quavers in the bath…” The generational rootedness keeps her sane, you guess. She’s only been an MP since 2015, which means she’s only known opposition and car-crash crises. On the day we meet, the controversial Labour advert about the state of the justice system is in the news. The ad said: “Do you think adults convicted of sex offences against children should be in prison? Rishi Sunak doesn’t. Under the Tories 4,500 adults convicted of sexually assaulting children under 16 served no prison time.” What does she make of it? “Just before I came here, I had a woman come in to see me with her barrister,” she says. “She is on disability benefits, paid for by the taxpayer at a rate higher than Rishi pays on his millions, because she has had no rape trial. She first came forward when she was 13, about abuse she had suffered earlier in childhood. She has now waited years for the criminal justice system to put her alleged abuser on trial. At the same time he is free to walk the streets. I want Rishi Sunak to explain why that is acceptable. The advert is nowhere near angry enough.” Does she not think the personal attack on the prime minister will license the same in reverse next year? “You think they need a licence?” she says. “I have spent my entire career being accused of propping up [grooming gangs] in Rotherham. All that pearl-clutching drives me mad…” She’s finished her fish and chips now but she’s just getting going on how this government has failed the country across the board. She was 14, she says, when Tony Blair became Labour leader. “It’s not that long ago, but I was able to buy my first house when I was 20,” she says. “My son is 18. He might as well piss in the wind as imagine that. We are getting to the point where people in their 20s and 30s are relying on someone they love to die so they can afford somewhere to live.” When she does her rounds campaigning on the doorstep these days, she says, one phrase often comes to mind: “Do you remember when things used to get better?” I can almost feel a song coming on, I say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
