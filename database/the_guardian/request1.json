The news came after it was announced on Friday that Allan would step down as chair of Tesco at the supermarket’s annual general meeting on 16 June. Four allegations about Allan emerged during the Guardian’s investigation into the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) – the UK’s foremost business lobbying group. Allan was president of the organisation between 2018 and 2020 and then vice-president until October 2021. Allan has denied three of the four claims made against him. Barratt stressed that it has not received any complaints about Allan during his tenure at the construction firm. The company said it was “in the best interests of Barratt to accelerate the planned transition to the new chairman of the board to prevent the ongoing impact of the allegations against John from becoming disruptive to the company”. Allan blamed the board’s decision to end his tenure early on “anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations” of misconduct against him, “which I vehemently deny”. Barratt said Allan would be replaced by the non-executive director and chair-designate Caroline Silver, a previous chair at the consumer goods business PZ Cussons who remains an independent non-executive director at Tesco. Silver was announced as Barratt’s chair-designate in January, but had not been expected to join the company until 1 June, before succeeding Allan as chair on 6 September. Jock Lennox, Barratt’s senior independent director, thanked Allan for his tenure, saying: “The board is grateful to John for his nine years of service to Barratt. He leaves the company in a strong financial and operational position.” On 9 May, the Guardian reported that Allan allegedly touched the bottom of a senior member of Tesco staff in June 2022, at the company’s last AGM. It was also claimed he touched the bottom of a member of staff at the CBI at its annual dinner in May 2019, when he was the organisation’s president. Sources alleged that Allan, 74, made inappropriate remarks on those occasions as well as separate, similar comments to two other female members of CBI staff in November 2019 and in 2021 respectively. Some of the women said they were offended by the alleged actions and considered his behaviour to be sexual harassment. Allan has admitted making a comment about a CBI staffer’s appearance that she found to be offensive in 2019. Allan apologised for the remark after discussion with the group’s then director general, Carolyn Fairbairn. A spokesperson for Allan said the other three claims were “simply untrue”. Allan said: “It is with regret that at the request of the board I am stepping down as chairman of Barratt Developments plc as of 30 June 2023, ahead of finishing my tenure in early September as planned. “My early departure from Barratt is a result of the anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations made against me, as reported in the Guardian which I vehemently deny.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-latest-news-belgorod-kremlin-russian-pm-china","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T08:25:32Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Belgorod governor urges residents not to return to area attacked by anti-Kremlin militia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-latest-news-belgorod-kremlin-russian-pm-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-latest-news-belgorod-kremlin-russian-pm-china","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Belgorod governor urges residents not to return to area attacked by anti-Kremlin militia","bodyText":"Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has reported that the city of Toretsk has been struck this morning. He wrote: This morning, the Russians struck Toretsk – fortunately, without casualties. The school in which the point of invincibility is located, an extension to the temple and a high-rise building within a radius of 100 metres from the epicenter were damaged. According to preliminary information, the enemy used aerial bombs. The claims have not been independently verified. 23 May is celebrated as a national day for Ukrainian marines, and the president has posted some images of himself meeting service personnel on his social media channels. In a post, Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote: Our defenders. Frontline. Today I am here to congratulate our warriors on the day of the Ukrainian marines. Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Richard Dannatt, former chief of the general staff of the British armed forces has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. He told viewers that he felt there was a good chance that Russian morale in the army could crack if a Ukrainian counteroffensive started with gains. He told viewers: They shouldn’t launch it before they’re ready. Quite rightly, they’re integrating the weapons and the advice and the equipment and the training that the west has been giving them. But I’m quite certain that at the moment of their choosing, and I think the time is getting quite close now, and at a place of their choosing, and that’s entirely up to them, I think they have the chance, if they can strike some decisive blows on the Russians, that they could have significant effect. Now, that doesn’t mean to say the war is going to be over in a few days and weeks. D-day on 6 June 1944 was the start of the Normandy campaign, but it lasted for quite some time. But I think we will see some decisive strikes, which could be potentially spectacularly successful. Because, think of it from the Russian soldiers point of view. Most of them don’t want to be there. They are poorly trained, poorly equipped, poorly clothed, poorly led. Frankly their morale could crack, and that’s what the Ukrainians really need to achieve. Because once a soldier, once an army thinks it’s beaten, frankly, it is beaten. Germany is looking into options to support a coalition of countries that plan to train Ukrainian pilots in flying F-16 fighter jets, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said on Tuesday. Reuters reports he added that any potential German contribution could be minor only, as Germany itself does not own any of the US-built jets. Ukrainian forces still control the south-western edge of the city of Bakhmut and fighting in the city itself has decreased, deputy Ukrainian defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed on Tuesday. Reuters reports she wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Kyiv’s forces had made some progress “on the flanks to the north and south of Bakhmut” and that Russian forces, which say they have taken the city itself, were continuing to clear areas they control. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that there has been an interruption in power supplies in Kherson as a result of Russian military action. Citing the head of the city region, Roman Mrochko, it writes: In Kherson, electricity supply was temporarily stopped in Korabel microdistrict. Energy workers are repairing the reserve line damaged by the shelling of the Russian troops. Water supply interruptions are possible. After the completion of the works, electricity will be supplied stably. The claims have not been independently verified. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of defence, has been speaking to Times Radio in the UK, and has said Ukraine is confident that the incident in Belgorod will not be the last time insurrection is seen within Russian borders. He told listeners: It is quite surprising to us that it has taken so long for Russian insurgents and Russian partisans to become more active in terms of trying to get rid of the terrorist regime which is inflicting death and destruction on Ukraine, which is isolating Russia internationally. Over 200,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Apparently the breaking point has been reached. Why is it happening now? Because Ukrainian armed forces have exposed that Russia is a paper tiger. We have exposed that Russia can and should be beaten on the battlefield. This is what we are doing in Ukraine. And we are confident that this has encouraged Russian partisans and those Russian citizens who hope to change something, and don’t want to be part of this crime of aggression. Russians who don’t want to be associated with this terrorism. Who don’t want their children to, you know, live with this eternal shame and disgrace because of what a group of people in the Kremlin are doing to Ukraine and the world. Sak distanced Ukraine from direct involvement with the partisans, but said they shared similar aims: I think the objective of those activities has been articulated yesterday by the people who have committed them. They have said they want to demilitarise that part of Russia. They want the war to go away from their territory. And this is in line actually with our objectives. Because we believe that for Ukraine to be safe and for Europe to be safe, after we defeat Russia on the battlefield we will need to all establish a demilitarised zone of some form in parts of Russia. Ukraine’s general staff has issued its situation update, claiming that Russia struck three regions of Ukraine yesterday with missiles. It writes: Russia carried out 20 missile strikes against Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv oblasts, using cruise missiles, Iskander-M ballistic missiles, and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles over the past day. Furthermore, Russia launched 48 airstrikes using Shahed drones, and targeted both civilian and military targets with up to 90 strikes using multiple-launch rocket systems Shellings resulted in a yet unspecified number of injuries among civilians, as well as damages to residential buildings, kindergartens, and other civilian infrastructure. There were over 30 combat engagements with the Russian military in the directions of Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Marinka. Ukraine’s defences downed four cruise missiles Kh-101/Kh-555, one Mi-24 attack helicopter, 25 Shahed drones, and nine reconnaissance drones. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has posted an update to Telegram on the wounded civilians caught up in the fighting inside Russia’s border after Monday’s incursion. He wrote: The couple was taken to the city hospital No 2. The woman has shrapnel wounds of the lower extremities, the state of traumatic shock is severe. The man with abdominal wounds is in a state of moderate severity. Now they are in the emergency department under the close supervision of doctors. All necessary medical assistance is provided. The claims have not been independently verified. Earlier the governor urged residents to stay away, stating that works to clear the scene were ongoing. Here is a little more detail from the most recent update on the situation in Belgorod, via governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. It appears authorities have still not gained control of the situation. About two hours ago, Gladkov urged residents not to return to the area, writing on Telegram: On the situation in the Grayvoron district. The cleaning of the territory by the ministry of defence together with law enforcement agencies continues. We will immediately notify residents, and I will publish on my social networks, when it is safe [to return]. Unfortunately, a woman born in 1941 died yesterday during evacuation measures. Most sincere condolences to loved ones. Anything you need, of course, we will help. I understand that no one can bring back a loved one. There is information that in those settlements that the enemy entered, there are two wounded civilians. So far, the security forces have not been able to reach them. That is the top priority this morning. I hope that we will be able to evacuate them as soon as possible and deliver them to a medical facility. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update, in which it says, “Between 19 and 22 May 2023, Russian security forces highly likely clashed with partisans in at least three locations within Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, near the Ukrainian border,” and that, “The identity of the partisans remains unconfirmed, but Russian anti-regime groups claimed responsibility.” A top Russian official who faces sanctions in the west over Moscow’s war on Ukraine visited Saudi Arabia early Tuesday and held talks with his counterpart in the kingdom, AP reports, citing Saudi state media. Russian interior minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev’s visit to Riyadh came days after Zelenskiy addressed an Arab League summit held in Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea port city of Jeddah on Friday. The visits underline how the kingdom and Gulf Arab states, traditionally the security clients of the US, have been maintaining their relations with Moscow amid the Ukraine war. The state-run Saudi Press Agency said Kolokoltsev met with Saudi interior minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud. “During the session, they discussed ways to enhance security cooperation paths between the two countries’ ministries of interior, in addition to discussing a number of issues of common interest,” the report said, without elaborating. Russian media did not immediately report on the visit. Reuters reports that the US State Department on Monday said Russia’s Wagner Group is trying to obscure its efforts to acquire military equipment for use in Ukraine, adding that Washington has been informed the mercenary force is seeking to move those acquisitions through Mali to aid Russia in its war. Wagner is willing to use false paperwork for such transactions, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at a regular news briefing. “There are indications that Wagner has been attempting to purchase military systems from foreign suppliers and route these weapons through Mali as a third party,” Miller said. “We have not seen as of yet any indications that these acquisitions have been finalized or executed, but we are monitoring the situation closely.” Miller said Washington has imposed sanctions on a number of people and entities that support Wagner’s military operations, and said the United States would have more to share soon. Reuters could not immediately reach Mali’s government for comment. The Institute for the Study of War has taken a look at the response to the attacks in Belgorod among Russian war bloggers. “While the majority of milbloggers responded with relatively varied concern, anxiety, and anger, the information space did not coalesce around one coherent response, which indicates first and foremost that the attack took Russian commentators by surprise, the US think tank writes. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has arrived in China, Moscow’s foreign ministry said, for a visit in which he will meet with President Xi Jinping and ink a series of deals on infrastructure and trade, AFP reports. Mishustin arrived late Monday in Shanghai, the ministry said, where he was greeted at the airport by Moscow’s ambassador to China Igor Morgulov and Beijing’s top diplomat to Russia Zhang Hanhui. He will take part in a Russian-Chinese Business Forum and visit a petrochemical research institute in Shanghai, the Kremlin said, as well as hold talks with “representatives of Russian business circles”. Mishustin will then travel to Beijing, where he will meet with Xi and Premier Li Qiang, Russian state media TASS has said. Belgorod governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has just posted an update on Telegram. He has urged Grayvoron residents not to return to their homes – “It is not worth it yet”, he says. Gladkov added that there have been “no civilian deaths” as a result of the attacks. “There are no civilian deaths to date. All necessary actions on the part of law enforcement agencies are being carried out. We are waiting for the completion of the counter-terrorist operation that was announced yesterday,” he wrote. Fighting broke out along the Russian border with Ukraine on Monday after self-described Russian partisan forces claimed to have overrun a border village within Russia for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, said it had crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Footage of the raid, purportedly from a border checkpoint in Grayvoron, showed casualties including a Russian officer lying face down in a pool of blood next to Russian passports and other documents scattered on the floor. The video also showed armoured vehicles appearing to overrun the post. The Belgorod governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said eight people were wounded after Grayvoron came under Ukrainian artillery fire, news agencies reported. Most residents had left the area but the situation remained “tense”, he said. Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces claimed to have overrun a border village within Russia for the first time in the war. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed and work was under way to drive out the “saboteurs”, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, said it had crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Another anti-Kremlin militia, the Russian Volunteer Corps, which is led by a prominent Russian nationalist, also said it had taken part in the raid. Late on Monday it released video footage showing what it said was a fighter inspecting a captured armoured vehicle. The growing chaos in the Belgorod region, where local authorities announced a “counterterrorist regime” on Monday evening, was a rare case where Russian villages have come face-to-face with a conflict that their army has unleashed across Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border. Our full story is here: Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: After fighting broke out along the Russian border with Ukraine – with self-described Russian partisan forces claiming to have overrun a border village within Russia for the first time in the war – Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed and work was under way to drive out the “saboteurs”, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. And Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has arrived in China, Moscow’s foreign ministry said, for a visit in which he will meet with President Xi Jinping and ink a series of deals on infrastructure and trade. Here are the other key recent developments: Twelve northern European countries met to discuss stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. Defence ministers from the Northern Group met in Poland on Monday where talks described as “very good” by the Polish defence minister were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine’s air force said on Telegram, “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons on Monday. The Labour leader also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets” and said “whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” The United Nations expressed concern on Monday that Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Pivdennyi had not received any ships since 2 May under a deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertiliser. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric did not say who was to blame for the lack of ships travelling to the port, near Odesa. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/may/23/australia-politics-news-live-narendra-modi-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-parliament-senate-estimates-snowy-hydro","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T08:23:03Z","webTitle":"Spy boss says terrorism threat lower – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/23/australia-politics-news-live-narendra-modi-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-parliament-senate-estimates-snowy-hydro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/23/australia-politics-news-live-narendra-modi-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-parliament-senate-estimates-snowy-hydro","fields":{"headline":"Spy boss says terrorism threat lower – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today – thanks so much for joining us. Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas handed down his ninth and “most difficult” budget today. You can read the full details here. Included in the budget was the announcement that native forest logging will end across Victoria in December, six years earlier than previously planned. The federal government was pressed at Senate estimates as to why a public servant who held top jobs at two departments responsible for robodebt was given a plum $900,000-a-year job in June 2022 as an Aukus adviser. Penny Wong responded that evidence revealed during the robodebt royal commission went “beyond what [she] would’ve anticipated” The police officer who Tasered 95-year-old Claire Nowland at an aged care facility in Cooma last week has been suspended from duty with pay. Offshore processing on Nauru will cost Australia more than $400m this year, despite there being only 22 refugees and asylum seekers left at the Pacific Island’s regional processing centre. Qantas is on track to deliver a record net profit of up to $2.48bn this financial year amid surging travel demand, representing a sharp turnaround for the national carrier. Affordable rental properties in Australian capital cities are at a “record low”, with the number of properties listed for under $400 a week halving over the past year. Australian and Indian PMs set for Indian gala in Sydney A rally at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney to celebrate Australia’s large and vibrant Indian community is kicking off shortly, with prime minister Anthony Albanese due to speak at around 6.45pm before introducing Indian PM Narendra Modi. It is the Indian leader’s first visit to Australia since 2014 and the event is expected to draw around 20,000 people. Celebrations have already begun, with performers taking to the stage. Catch up on today’s biggest headlines so far with this wrap from my colleague Antoun Issa: Moves in the ministries In a mini-shuffle to the Albanese ministry, Patrick Gorman will be appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister for public service, known as assistant minister for the public service. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister to the prime minister. Meanwhile, Andrew Leigh has been appointed as parliamentary secretary to the minister for employment and workplace relations, known as assistant minister for employment. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister for competition, charities and treasury. [continued from last post] Waters later asked questions about the threat the development may pose to Larrakia cultural heritage and whether satisfactory consultation with Larrakia people had occurred. The department agreed it was “open to the minister” (Tanya Plibersek) to conclude the Northern Territory government needed to provide more information if she was not satisfied adequate consultation had occurred. Waters also asked if the federal government should be taking a more “proactive approach” to cultural heritage in the wake of the Juukan Gorge inquiry and whether the strategic assessment of the Middle Arm development should be paused until national cultural heritage laws were reformed. The assistant climate change and energy minister, Jenny McAllister, said she could not comment about projects that were still under consideration. Darwin Harbour project scrutinised Another update on the proposed Middle Arm development from earlier today in the environment estimates hearing. The Albanese government is taking a $1.5bn stake in the project on Darwin Harbour. The Greens senator Larissa Waters pursued a long line of questioning about what industries will have facilities at the site and the standard of consultation with Darwin’s traditional owners, the Larrakia people. This follows reporting by Guardian Australia that the precinct, dubbed a sustainable development hub, is seen as “a key enabler” for the export of gas from the Beetaloo Basin and would improve the feasibility of offshore carbon capture and storage projects. Waters read from another document – written during the previous term of government – released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information. That document says the precinct would provide a “world class hub for gas production and manufacturing” by 2030. Waters wanted to know what aspect of the precinct that description is captured under. The department said: That would be captured under the low emissions petrochemicals where they’re looking at potentially doing ethylene, urea, ammonia. ‘The time to act is now’, Stella Assange says Stella Assange was speaking after a meeting in Canberra with the Bring Julian Assange Home parliamentary group, a cross-party grouping whose co-chairs recently held talks with the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy. Assange said that showed that the US realised the attempt to extradite Julian Assange was becoming a problem in the diplomatic relationship: I think that’s encouraging that the Biden administration understands that this is a problem for Australia, and it’s coming in the way of their relationship with Australia and that the Australian people want a resolution to this case. And of course, it is the Australian people who will be paying for the Aukus arrangement over the next 30 years, so this is not something that can be ignored. Stella Assange said there had been “a sea change in the mood here in Australia”. She called for ongoing constructive engagement between the Australian government and the US and the UK. The timing was “critical” because the US was about to enter its election cycle and the UK high court could issue its final decision on extradition within months: So the time to act is now … and the Australian government is crucial to finding a path through which all parties can find a resolution to this. Stella Assange declined to criticise the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for not meeting with her this week, after the independent MP Andrew Wilkie raised it in question time yesterday. She said it “wasn’t really on my agenda” as she was in Canberra primarily to address the National Press Club, before tomorrow’s rally in Sydney that had been timed to coincide with the now-cancelled Quad summit. Assange’s wife says top Australian envoy set to visit him again at Belmarsh Stella Assange has confirmed that her husband, WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange, is likely to receive further visits in Belmarsh prison in London by the Australian high commissioner to the UK, Stephen Smith. She dropped by the Guardian Australia office in the press gallery at Parliament House today and said it was “significant that it was the high commissioner and not just a consular official who visited Julian” in prison last month: The day that the high commissioner visited, Julian was supposed to receive a visit from the top two representatives of Reporters Without Borders and they were rejected by the prison. It’s clear that what Julian needs from the Australian government is diplomatic support. It’s not a question about, you know, the administrative situation within the prison, it’s the fact that he’s in prison in the first place. Julian has done nothing wrong. He shouldn’t have spent a single day in prison. He has been accused of acts of journalism – and if journalism is a crime, then there are a bunch of criminals in this press gallery … I think the signals are very clear. The high commissioner visited Julian and he’s going to visit him again. Julian Assange, an Australian citizen, remains in Belmarsh prison as he fights a US attempt to extradite him to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables. Cruise passenger dies while swimming on Mystery Island Carnival Cruise Line has confirmed that a passenger has died while swimming on Mystery Island in Vanuatu, during an apparent medical episode. In a statement, a spokesperson said: Carnival Cruise Line is deeply saddened by the death of a guest on Mystery Island, following what appears to be a medical situation whilst swimming. Our care team are supporting the guest’s family along with other guests during this difficult time. The Carnival Splendour cruise ship departed from Sydney on May 15 and is due to arrive back in Sydney tomorrow. Voice debate should look beyond party politics, MP says On the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, NSW Liberal senator Holly Hughes is asked about opposition leader Peter Dutton’s comments in parliament yesterday that an Indigenous voice to parliament is Orwellian and would divide Australians. She said the debate was already leading to division: Noel Pearson in particular, every time he comes out and speaks about it, he accuses anyone who asks the question – not even, not someone who is saying they object to it – they’re a racist, they’re a Judas. Labor MP Josh Burns responded: I don’t think we should loose sight in the political comings and goings. It is not about the Labor party, or the Labor government or the Liberal party, it is about what are we doing for the first Australians. Burns also pointed to Stan Grant’s speech on Q+A from last night as an indication of how people should conduct themselves: On the topic on the way in which we engage in political debates, [Stan Grant] last night gave a pretty powerful reminder of the way in which we need to be conducting ourselves. [He] gave us a moment where we can reflect on how we talk about issues, and how we interact with each other with respect. I think it’s incumbent on all of us to make sure we are elevating this debate and doing it respectfully. Burgess on the ‘hive of spies’ Asio chief Mike Burgess is being asked about his infamous comments about disrupting a “hive of spies”, and why those spies were not prosecuted. Greens senator David Shoebridge wonders why there are not criminal prosecutions, for example, when there are plots to lure Australians overseas and kill them. Burgess said sometimes the most effective solution is removal, not prosecution: One way that spying can occur in this country is there would be people posted to this country under diplomatic cover, who actually are not diplomats – they are spies. And when we discover that, we call it out and we remove them from this country by letting their visa lapse [expelling them] from this country. The key thing in the case of the hive of spies was the most effective way of reducing that harm was to have them removed from the country quietly and effectively. The outcome was achieved. Shoebridge is doing his best to get Burgess to comment on this story about Daniel Duggan, but Burgess is not having a bar of it. The Nationals’ member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, has a spray at the Victorian government’s plan to phase out native forest logging shortly before question time. He said: In my 15 years as a member of parliament I’ve never been more disgusted in a government decision than I am today. The Dan Andrews government has kicked every hardworking native timber industry family in the guts today and not one of those opposite has raised a single word of protest. People and wildlife die in poorly managed forests. Dan Andrews has a plan to shut down the native timber industry in 2024. It’s a plan to kill country towns, it’s a plan to kill wildlife and a plan to kill Australian jobs. This is a Dan-made disaster which will devastate our communities and take a generation to recover from … If the Greens are cheering you’ve made the wrong decision. Police arrest man after stabbing in Airport West, Melbourne Victorian Police have arrested a man after a woman was stabbed at Airport West in Melbourne this afternoon. Investigators have been told a man attacked a woman at a business on Louis Street around 1.30pm. A 55-year-old woman sustained suspected stab wounds and was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. Investigators located a 34-year-old Essendon man nearby who was then arrested. He is currently assisting police with their enquiries. A crime scene has been set up while police work to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident. Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, is in Papua New Guinea for the US-Pacific Islands Dialogue and has shared some images on social media from his visit. Many thanks to Amy for taking us through the morning! I’ll be with you for the remainder of the day, let’s get into it. Emily Wind will take you through the evening – the house will sit late to continue the referendum legislation debate, so expect some tired MPs tomorrow morning. Thank you to everyone who joined along with me today – it was long and you were all troopers and I could not get through QT without you. I will be back early tomorrow morning for the third day of Politics Live – until then, please, take care of you. Ax Anthony Albanese is about to head to Sydney (if he hasn’t already) for his 6pm community event with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. About 20,000 people are expected to attend. Modi has spent the day holding meetings with business leaders. He will hold his official bilateral with Albanese tomorrow morning. Union says Victorian logging decision could cost hundreds of jobs The union for timber industry workers has blasted the Andrews government for ending native forest logging earlier than expected. In Tuesday’s budget, the Andrews government revealed it would bring forward the end date of native logging to the start of next year rather than the end of the decade. It comes after court decisions which found the state-owned timber agency VicForests had not adequately protected endangered species. Michael O’Connnor, national secretary of the CFMEU, said it was a decision “driven by Spring Street” that failed to consult the industry. It’s a shame that he [premier Daniel Andrews] only governs for Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. If you’re in any other part of the state, you don’t get a look in. O’Connor said hundreds of jobs could be lost from the decision. ‘Big step forward’ in bringing leadbeater’s possum back from brink A small update from environment estimates about a very small possum. Every estimates hearing for years, the Greens senator Janet Rice has asked the department what has happened to the overdue recovery plan for the leadbeater’s possum. This question is particularly relevant today given one of the main threats to the critically endangered possum has been native forest logging in Victoria, which the Andrews government has announced will end in January. Debate over forestry led to a plan to prevent the extinction of the leadbeater’s possum stalling for years. Environment officials have come prepared today with an answer to this question and say they are pleased to report the draft plan is finally ready and has gone to the threatened species scientific committee for their review. A “very big step forward”, they say. Australian extremists are “inspired” by mass shootings overseas and neo-Nazi attempts to recruit people have been “amplified”, but the terrorism threat is lower, Asio’s Mike Burgess has told Senate estimates. But it still means it’s possible. He also explained that far right groups were “smarter” and not advocating terror attacks publicly, so fewer of them were listed as terrorist groups. After questions about connections between anti-trans activists and neo-Nazis, Liberal senator Alex Antic wanted to know if Asio was aware of threats from “violent” trans activists. Burgess said: Not from my perspective. There was a question on this during question time from Andrew Wilkie – but it won’t be the last one. As the indexation date approaches, more and more people are pushing for it to be scrapped. Asio weighs ‘threat’ to voice referendum Spy chief Mike Burgess said Asio was keeping an eye on the upcoming voice referendum: We look at all major things and minor things in society that actually could potentially represent a threat to security. [The voice referendum] is a significant event. And we continually look at that situation. We have done a recent assessment where we look at the possible threat to the referendum at this stage. We are not seeing indications of people planning a terrorist attack as part of that. That’s something that we constantly look at, noting the terrorism threat level is still probable. Separately, Burgess said the visible increase in neo-Nazi activity (which I covered in the post below) was because they were more “emboldened” and also trying to recruit people. “Their actions are awful but lawful,” he said, but added: There’s a small element of that group that do and may well take action to accelerate the downfall of society as they see it, but it may well be they’re looking to build their base so they can improve their influence and engage through normal political discourse and have an influence to their satisfaction through other means, which of course has happened in history. Greens senator David Shoebridge is trying to draw Burgess out on a connection between anti-trans activists and neo Nazis, but not having much luck. So the ministry doesn’t expand, but some of the responsibilities of ministers will be shared with existing assistant ministers (which is just a fancy way of saying parliamentary secretary) because existing workloads were too much. Ministry shifts announced Those ministry changes which were flagged in the Labor caucus meeting have been officially announced: Patrick Gorman MP will be appointed as parliamentary secretary to the minister for the public service, known as assistant minister for the public service. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister to the prime minister. Dr Andrew Leigh MP will be appointed as parliamentary secretary to the minister for employment and workplace relations, known as assistant minister for employment. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister for competition, charities and treasury. Dr Leigh will be appointed to administer the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in addition to the Department of the Treasury. Senator Anthony Chisholm will continue as assistant minister for regional development, however, his appointment will change from parliamentary secretary to the minister for regional development, local government and territories to the parliamentary secretary to the minister for infrastructure, transport, regional development and local government. Senator Chisholm’s appointment as assistant minister for education will not change. (cont from previous post) Smith and Farrell then engaged in a bit of a quarrel about Labor’s record on successfully delivering referendums, Smith pointing to the pulled 2013 referendum on local government (when Albanese himself was local government minister) and noting that the last successful referendum from Labor was in 1946. “If PM Bob Hawke and PM Gough Whitlam couldn’t deliver referendum outcomes for the Labor party and for their Labor governments, why does PM Albanese think that he should be able to?” Smith said. “Given that he already has a track record of failing to deliver local government recognition?” Farrell shot back: You’ve fallen into the same trap as all of his critics, that is you constantly underestimate him. Can I give you a bit of advice, senator Smith? Please don’t underestimate this man. Smith posed one final question, asking if the government would consider a Yes vote of 60% a success – noting that would mean 40% of people voted no. Committee chair Louise Pratt cut him off and moved to the next question before Farrell could properly answer. Farrell defends PM in referendum stoush Trade minister Don Farrell has given a strident defence of PM Anthony Albanese, telling a Liberal senator “please don’t underestimate this man” in a heated debate around the referendum. Liberal senator Dean Smith took the Australian Electoral Commission down a detailed line of questioning about the possible date of the referendum, asking the AEC to rule in or out certain dates the vote could possibly be held on. Knocking out school holidays, and Saturdays at the end of parliament weeks, Smith proposed that the only suitable dates for the referendum would be in mid-October or early November (coincidentally, we’ve heard mid-October is most likely at this stage). Smith, at one stage, commented that most referendums start out with high support that is then eroded away, hypothesising Labor would want to hold this vote earlier rather than later. Farrell, the special minister of state, later rejected this analysis, claiming some referendums decades ago had bucked this trend, pointing to a referendum in 1977. Smith said: The world has changed considerably since 1977. (continued in next post) Asio chief warns on spy recruiting “It’s easy for people to get sucked in,” spy chief Mike Burgess says, warning Australians travelling overseas to be wary of spies trying to cultivate a relationship with them. Australian Harry Harding came forward last week saying he thought he was being groomed while working in China. Burgess, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director general of security, declined to comment on that specific case but said Australians overseas in general “need to be concerned that they might be unwittingly drawn into unlawful acts in terms of providing information”. He said: Remember, the spies don’t always rock up to you and present themselves as: ‘hey, I’m a spy, I’d like you to do this for me’. In some cases, they may well do that, depending on the individual they’re approaching. So people just need to be on the lookout for suspicious or unusual and persistent approaches, and [if someone asks you to] provide insights into something, or give [them] access to something, you might want to think about why they’re asking you for that. He also said while Nazi symbolism was more visible, it had at one point comprised 50% of Asio’s investigations, but was now back down to 30%. He gave this breakdown of national security threats: It is approximately 70% religiously motivated violent extremism, specifically Sunni extremism. The remainder, 30%, is ideologically motivated, violent extremism and most of that is nationalist and racist, violent extremism, which is sometimes also called far right or other kinds of descriptions [such as neo-Nazis]. It’s a really extreme right wing. Nazis have been a thing in this country for a long time. Pesutto blasts Andrews government ‘mismanagement’ Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto says the state is paying the price of the “mismanagement” and “incompetence” of the Andrews government. Pesutto said no Victorian would be spared the pain of the budget, which focuses on repaying the state’s record debt accumulated during the pandemic. Every Victorian will pay some part of the price for Labor’s incompetence. Opposition treasurer spokesperson Brad Roswell slammed the decision to no longer exempting high-fee private schools from payroll. He equated it to creating a “hit list” of private schools and said it would lead to higher fees for parents. S&amp;P Global ratings said today’s budget showed the fiscal recovery “will be a slow and long process”. The projected cash surplus by 2025 would be the first since 2019. Still, “[d]espite some positive developments, Victoria’s fiscal outlook remains weak compared with other Australian states”, said Anthony Walker, an S&amp;P analyst. By 2024, we expect Victoria’s gross debt as a proportion of revenues to be about 200% of operating revenues or three times more than it was at the start of the pandemic.” Still today’s budget provides “some headroom” for the state’s ‘AA’ rating, implying it will be left alone for now. It’s worth noting, though, that states and territory debt ratings won’t stray too far from the federal government’s level because ratings agencies assume Canberra will step in if any state’s finances were really in a tailspin. Victoria’s economy by numbers As Victoria accounts for about a quarter of the Australian economy, it’s worth noting how that state is faring after the Andrews government’s ninth budget landed today. (See the main story here and winners and losers here, by Benita Kolovos and Adeshola Ore.) For one thing, Victoria’s economic performance has been lagging the nation lately, with growth (as measured by gross state product) at 2.75% for the current year, versus national GDP expansion of 3.25%. From here on, the trajectories should be similar, according to forecasts in the federal and state budgets. The state’s consumer inflation rate will end this fiscal year at 7%, vs a national average of 6%. Price rises, though, are projected to slow at a similar rate for Victoria and the nation, reaching 4.25% and 3.25%, respectively, by June 2024. After that, the CPI will also coalesce. Victoria’s jobless rate (3.9% in April vs 3.7% nationally) will generally be higher than the national average for most of the coming years (with the exception of 2024-25). By 2026-27, the unemployment rate will be 4.75%, notably higher than the national average of 4.25% then, at least according to the budgets’ forecasts. Ratings agencies, though, are interested in Victoria’s debt path as it absorbs the state’s big build program even if some project delays or cancellation. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on how the government is making Australia better and then ends question time. I think we have all had enough today. Bridget Archer asks Stephen Jones (the assistant treasurer): The Westpac consumer sentiment index reveals some 60% of the falling consumer sentiment in May is attributed to the federal budget. Middle Australia is hurting. Why does Labor keep making it worse? Jones: We’re proud of the budget we delivered 10 days ago, a budget that delivers for all, and on election commitments, that ensures that with a hard head we’re able to deliver in 12 months what this mob over here couldn’t deliver in nine long years. That is, a budget which is bringing the finances back under control. Because we did bring the finances back under control, something that they promised to do for over eight years but couldn’t deliver on. We’re able to be a budget that also has a big heart. A big heart to ensure that we can fix the mess that they left us on Medicare, because when we came into government, Medicare had been flogged to within an inch of its life. We are tripling the payments for bulk billing to ensure that those who most need it are able to get to see a doctor. We’re making medicines more affordable. We’re making childcare more affordable. As the minister for aged care has just demonstrated in a master class of how to respond to the ridiculousness from those opposite, we are ensuring that not only are residents in aged care getting the treatment that they need, but the people who look after them are getting the pay that they deserve. Step after step after step, the budget that we have delivered is ensuring we’re delivering on our promises, building more sustainable finances, but also building a fairer Australia. It’s something that mob on that side couldn’t do in eight tawdry long years. Annnnd Michael Sukkar is booted out of the chamber under 94A. Seems like the Queenslanders are not having it at all today. Wells: I agree the whole of Australia wants us to fix aged care. I agree the whole of Australia went to the election last year and voted for a government to take the aged care crisis seriously. I agree the whole of Australia considered the two offerings from each of the two parties of government and said: we trust Labor to address this crisis and to try to lift the standard of aged care in this country. Having had 15 long months with the final report of the royal commission into aged care, having chosen to address only nine of 148 recommendations, the opposition raises the 24/7 nursing policy – they don’t have a stance on a 24/7 policy. They don’t have a position on 24/7 nurses… They didn’t fund it or roll it out, address the workforce crisis that formed on their watch. I’ve been addressing a workforce crisis that stems from 2017, $2.5 billion worth of funding cuts that I chose to make that set in place a rolling crisis of neglect, addressed by a royal commission and even now they walk into this chamber and say, oh, we see you are urgently acting to address the crisis. How dare you do it so quickly? How dare you act so quickly, we’re worried it’s too fast. Unbelievable. Wells continues: A workforce crisis formed on their watch that has taken 12 months to address through working on migration settings with the minister for immigration, for home affairs, for skills, for education, for health, the prime minister, the treasurer. Every single minister has had to spend time cleaning up their mess, to address the crisis in aged care. They seriously walked in today to say you’re doing it too fast, you’re cleaning up the mess too quickly. How dare you try to address a crisis in an urgent manner. Unbelievable. Yet, here we are after 12 months, with them having learned nothing. Melissa Price tries to make a point of order on relevance but she underestimates just how annoyed Anika Wells actually is with this question. Former Morrison minster Melissa Price wants to know from aged care minister Anika Wells: Already 23 aged care homes have closed under this government, compared to 300 opening under the former Coalition government. The Albanese government decision to [bring forward] the royal commission’s recommendations has imposed rigid constraints on the sector. Will the government now make a commitment to expanding the exemption criteria until the current workforce crisis has been addressed? (The Tveeder transcription changes aged care minister to the menace of aged care, which shows AI is alive to the vibe of Price’s question.) Wells is not having it today: I cannot believe those opposite, of all weeks, would choose this week to try and lecture the government on management and funding of the aged care system. And to suggest, to dare criticise us for trying to pull every single lever we have at our disposal to try and lift the standard of aged care as quickly as humanly possible. To walk into this chamber and criticise us for trying to take that action to lift the standard of care for residents is unfathomable, that they have learned nothing after neglecting the sector for nine long years, to walk in now and criticise the people left cleaning up their mess. Independent MP Zali Steggall also asks about the seriousness of this government acting on climate, given coal mines are still being approved contrary to science, and Anthony Albanese gives pretty much what is the rote answer – the government is serious about climate action and is investing in renewables to make the transition. Offsets for habitat destruction in focus Over in the estimates hearing for the environment department, the independent senator David Pocock has been asking officials to provide a clear answer about whether the government’s proposed nature market will allow for the purchase of biodiversity certificates to be used as offsets for habitat destruction. The answer to that question is yes. Officials are going to great lengths to emphasise that using the market for offsetting won’t be allowed to occur until a new national standard for offsetting has been legislated through reforms to Australia’s national environmental laws. The assistant minister for climate change and energy, Jenny McAllister, says: Certificates could be used as offsets if they comply with the offsets standard. The offsets standard is yet to be developed and will be subject to significant consultation It is not necessarily the case that certificates will meet that standard. And they are separate benchmarks if you will. Some may be certificates that will be established for one purpose, but in another where an entity is seeking to meet an offset standard is a separate test. Pocock asks if it is the case that there will be more demand for offsets under the scheme than there will be from companies voluntarily purchasing certificates in the market. The department says it doesn’t have an answer to that. Julie Collins answers Michael Sukkar’s question with what the Albanese government is doing in the housing space and finishes with: We want this fund to get through the Senate and every day of delay is at the fault of those in your party and of the Greens party. These are homes for people who need it most. These homes for women and children escaping family violence. Homes for older women at risk of hopelessness. Homes for our veterans that are at risk of homelessness. We want to get more homes on the ground more quickly and you were standing the way of that*. We are about to go [announce] our national housing homelessness plan. The other side [need to] to get out of the way when it comes to the housing Australia Future Fund. We have a comprehensive ambitious plan. Being supported by every state territory housing minister. Being supported by the advocate bodies. Supported by the HIA. By the Master builders Association. Our Housing Australia Future Fund has been supported by everyone, except for those opposite. It is being supported because it is a good idea to get more investment into housing but across the country. *I understand that this is designed to pull at the heart strings and to try and get public pressure to build, but people should not be used as pawns in political stand offs by any side. If the government wanted to get things moving for these people, it could compromise to get the Greens support. It works both ways. The Liberal MP for Deakin, Michael Sukkar, continues the “big Australia” scare campaign with: The government’s own budget papers say a further 1.5 million people will come to Australia over five years. But Labor’s half-baked Australia Future Fund will only provide 30,000 homes over that same five-year period. Where will the other 1.47 million people live? OK. The Coalition is against the fund and has voted against it. First, because it was inflationary, and now because it doesn’t provide enough homes. So bit of a contradiction there. Two – temporary migration was forecast to be higher under the Coalition’s budget papers. And the reason was the same: because there has been a bounce after the borders re-opened – people left Australia and didn’t come back in. Three – not all temporary migrants live in standalone houses. International students tend to live in student accomodation, backpackers in backpacker accomodation. Four – slams head on desk. Victorian Labor is ‘hurting people’, Greens say Greens finance spokesperson Sam Hibbins is speaking outside parliament post-budget: Everyday Victorians, who are already struggling, are going to be worse off under this budget. Despite there being a cost of living crisis, despite housing affordability being out of control, Labor – instead of choosing to help people in need – are actually hurting people. While supportive of the tax measures introduced, Hibbins is disappointed that in the pursuit of a surplus the government is making public sector cuts and not providing renters and others doing it tough with support: What we took to this budget was to tax profiteering corporations in order to fund helping people in need, to address the big challenges like the housing crisis, like the cost of living crisis. They’ve only done half the job – and make no mistake, should the budget get back into surplus, it will be off the back of workers. Victorian tenants ‘could face rent increases’ under budget The property council is warning Victorians tenants could face rental hikes due to a budget measure that will increase land taxes for investors. Under the state budget, handed down on Tuesday afternoon, property investors will face additional land tax charges. Cath Evans, Victoria executive director of the property council, said the changes would mean some investors would pay land tax for the first time. But she backed the abolishment of stamp duty for commercial and industrial properties in favour of an annual land tax. Let’s go back to the Victorian budget while Brendan O’Connor takes a dixer on fee-free tafe (more than 150,000 people having taken it up so far, as we reported earlier today) Industry groups have blasted the Andrews government for hitting large businesses with a new levy to help pay back record debt accumulated during the pandemic. Paul Guerra, chief executive of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the government was planning to use big businesses and property owners “as an ATM.” Peak industry body, Australian Industry Group, said businesses could look to invest internationally or in other states over Victoria. Tim Piper, Victorian head of the body, said the budget lacks “imagination and would be troubling for many businesses. Business has been used as a cash cow and businesses bearing the burden for a lot of the costs that are being imposed on the Victorian community at the moment. Clare continues: More generally, HECS helped millions and millions of Australians get to university and get a university degree. When I was a little kid, only about 7% of Australians had a university degree. When most of us were knee high to a grasshopper, very few Australians had a university degree. We are a different country today. Almost one in two Australians in their 30s has a university degree and a big part of that is because of HECS, which helped to fund and increase in the number of students going to university. That’s not true everywhere. In the member’s electorate, it’s only 30%. Where I grew up in Cabramatta, it’s about the same. In the member for McMahon only 25% in their 30s have a university degree. In the Treasurer’s electorate, it’s lower still, only about 19%, lower in the bush. It’s an order of magnitude less for our Indigenous brothers and sisters, only 7% have a university degree. This is what we’ve got to fix. The cost of university degrees is important, the cost of living is important, but the cost of those kids from those communities missing out is important, too. This is what we’ve got to fix. This at its core is what the Universities Accord will be all about. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie wants to know from Jason Clare: Minister, you would recall last year I challenged you about sky-rocketing HECS-HELP indexation and you committed to have the universities Accord Panel look at it. Ten months later charges are set to rise further by a record.1%. Minister m the circumstances, will you freeze the indexation, at left until the Universities Accord final report is delivered in September? Clare says: I made a commitment to get the accord team to look at that and they’re doing that. The accord team will report at the end of June with its interim report and provide a final report to me at the end of December. The short answer to your question is no. We have made no change to HECS in the budget. What we’ve done is provide extra support to students through an increase in Youth Allowance and AusStudy and an increase in rental assistance, which will help a lot of students with the cost of living. Minister for employment says Labor determined to close labour unequal pay loophole There is a dixer about same job same pay to Tony Burke, which gives the Liberal MP Andrew Wallace an opportunity to ask “Why do you hate subbies, Burkie” across the chamber. A reminder that the base pay to be a politician is over $212,000. Burke: There was a headline there today and it began with the words ‘Union admits ...’ I thought oh no, when you see the word ‘admits’, this will be trouble. ‘Admits Labor policy aims to drive up pay’. They’ve got us. Labor policy aims to drive up pay. That’s exactly why we’re determined to close the labour loophole and it’s exactly why those opposite are so determined to key the loophole. They’ve never seen a tax loophole that they didn’t want to keep forever and never seen a loophole that drives down wages that they didn’t want to defend just as earn evidently. The manager of opposition business described this as a made-up issue. That’s his description for it. Well, it’s not a made-up issue if you are a casual working side by side being paid less. It’s not a made-up issue for two workers with the same expertise, on the same job, with the same classification, one being paid less than the other. For them it’s not a made-up issue. For the mine works dealing with this it’s not a made-up issue. For the government that’s determined to act, this is a loophole we’re determined to close. PM says no cuts to Melbourne airport rail line in budget papers The Liberal MP for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie, wants to know: In the May budget the government made further cuts to infrastructure and referred hundreds of congestion busting projects to yet another infrastructure review. Yet the government’s own budget papers say a further 1.5 million people will come to Australia over five years. Why is this government putting at risk projects like the Melbourne airport rail line, where work is now halted? (We all know the facts about the 1.5m number right? I don’t need to post it again?) Anthony Albanese: I’m very pleased to get a question about infrastructure from the member for Flinders. She has had a look at the budget papers, there are no cuts in the budget papers. The dollars remain attached. You have a look at the budget papers and whoever gave you that question, I think the tactics committee need to reconsider their strategy, as the Treasurer said – the next level from asking me questions about infrastructure will be me questions about South Sydney Rugby league football club. (The joke being it’s two topics Albanese knows a lot about.) There is a back and forth over whether Madeleine King was reading from a document as she gave her dixer answer or not and whether she should table it if she was. Which I am absolutely sure voters really care about. There is a dixer on the climate tech pact signed between the US and Australia, but you would be better off reading this from Daniel Hurst: Anthony Albanese doesn’t read out Daniel Hurst’s factcheck. He answers by referring to some of the decisions made under the Coalition, including the Leppington triangle deal. Paul Fletcher is not happy: The question is relevance, about the motorway, not about local government and projects. I would have thought this PM of all people should know the difference between local infrastructure and major road and rail. Albanese says the Labor government is actually funding projects, while the Coalition didn’t. Fact checking the Coalition on their ‘1.5 million over 5 years’ immigration attack line (again) Paul Fletcher wants to know: In the May Budget, the government made cuts to infrastructure and record hundreds of congested busting project to get another review. But the budget papers show a further 1.5 million people* will come to Australia over five years. Why is this government putting [off] projects like upgrades to the M5 Motorway and the Western Sydney Airport Metrorail?” *taps the fact check sign* Net overseas migration is forecast to be 400,000 in 2022-23, followed by 315,000 the next year and 260,000 in each of the following three years. The Coalition has added these together to come up with the “1.5 million immigrants” figure. The budget papers explain that these figures are part of a post-pandemic catch-up and are driven by “a rapid recovery in the stock of international students, skilled temporary visa holders and working holiday makers”. At the same time, the budget says, “very low temporary migrant arrivals during the pandemic now means fewer departures – those who did not arrive cannot now leave”: The budget explains: The elevated forecast for net overseas migration in 2023–24 is largely driven by fewer temporary migrants departing Australia than usual, rather than a greater number of people arriving. Total net overseas migration “is not expected to catch up to the level forecast prior to the pandemic until 2029–30” and the total population is still expected to be 750,000 people smaller in June 2031 compared with pre-pandemic forecasts. Marles argues Coalition culture made ‘grand defence announcements on the basis of absolutely nothing’ The defence minister, Richard Marles, uses a dixer to run through his greatest hits on the former Coalition government over defence policy. He argues it has been “a transformational 12 months for our nation’s security”. He contends Australia had been “drifting through a sea of broken relationships” under the former government, but the Albanese government had improved Australia’s standing in the world, including with allies while also starting the process of stabilising the relationship with China. Marles says there was a culture under the former government of “grand defence announcements on the basis of absolutely nothing”. The opposition leader and former defence minister, Peter Dutton, appears to have been riled by this line of attack. He gets up to say “it would be relevant” to mention Aukus, which was initiated under the Coalition. Regional development minister confirms freight and recovery program will continue The former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack, known internationally as a kava ambassador, has a question for Kristy McBain, the minister for regional development: Will the minister guarantee the life-saving freight and recovery program will remain in existence? McBain: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Very important question. Simple answer, yes. Tanya Plibersek runs through the laundry list of what she says Labor is doing to protect the environment, but it doesn’t answer the question about approving new coal mines. Greens response to Victorian budget The Victorian Greens say struggling households have been left behind in the Andrews government’s state budget handed down on Tuesday. The budget focuses on repaying the state’s record debt accumulated during Covid by introducing a 10-year levy on big businesses. Victorians with an investment property will also be hit with a new tax and the government will slash the state’s public service jobs by as many as 4,000 roles. But there is minimal cost-of-living relief for Victorians. Samantha Ratnam, leader of the Victorian Greens said the Andrews government said the government had failed to fix the state’s revenue problems. Short-term measures won’t fix the housing crisis. In fact, this Labor government is funnelling four times more into the racing industry than new spending on people in housing stress or experiencing homelessness. Labor response to Greens question on climate change is to blame the Greens The Greens MP for Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown asks Tanya Plibersek: … you approved a new export coal mine in Queensland that would reportedly produce 500,000 tons of coal year and destroy [native] habitat. Why is Labor approving new coal mines in the middle of the climate emergency and how many more coal and gas projects will you approve in the coming months? Plibersek opens with: I want to say how proud I am to be part of a government acting on climate change. The first government to take serious action on climate change and it has been really instructive watching those of the crossbench line up with the Liberals and Nationals all too often to prevent and delay that action. The Guardian’s Paul Karp hears the Greens leader Adam Bandt say: “Are you serious?! Are you absolutely serious?!” in response. So it’s got off to a great start. Albanese’s response to ‘word salad’ question from opposition Here is what Anthony Albanese said in response. Annotations in brackets by me: Mr Speaker, that mess of a question was messier than the last government. They workshop these things in a meeting and come out and put it in writing. That word salad that I’m asked about. [There are a bunch of interjections] To return to the issue of middle Australia: our commitments that we made. We promised that 1.2 million families would pay less for childcare. Are we delivering that? We promised Australians would pay less for their medicines. Are we delivering that? [the caucus says ‘yes’ on cue] We promised to boost bulk billing, and to strengthen Medicare, are we delivering that? [you know the drill] We promised to rebuild manufacturing and establish a National Reconstruction Fund. Are we delivering that? [and again] We promised a royal commission on robodebt and, boy, have we delivered that. We promised to increase the minimum wage. Was that delivered? [yes again] We promised to look after aged care workers, was that delivered? [sigh] We promised to lift wages, was that delivered? [bigger sigh] We promised to have climate change targets of 43% by 2030, and net zero by 2050. Was that delivered? [Please make it stop] We promised to have a safeguard mechanism was that delivered? [cries under the desk] The truth is we on this side did the hard work in opposition to develop policy, to implement in government. Policies deliberately aimed at middle Australia, to make a difference after the wreck that we replaced, who were more concerned with themselves and ever since the election, are more concerned with themselves still. The opposition leader, of course, has a meeting tomorrow. He may well not be here at 2:00. I look forward to that. Fact-checking Sussan Ley and the Coalition on 1.5 million people immigrating over the next five years Sussan Ley is up with the next non-government question and ooohhh boy. The words ‘middle Australia’ somehow made it into the budget talking points last week but the problem is they were forgotten from the budget itself. The word infrastructure didn’t even make it into the talking points, let alone the Treasurer’s speech. Now the PM is going to bring in a further 1.5 million people over five years and at the same time [is] cutting infrastructure and raising taxes. Middle Australia is hurting and why does Labor keep making it worse? Before we get to Anthony Albanese’s answer, here is Guardian Australia reporter Daniel Hurst’s fact check on the “1.5m people over five years”talking point the Coalition has been using (Dan had it ready to go because it has got a bit of a workout since the budget was handed down). Dan: The budget doesn’t set this as a target or a policy as such – it outlines forecasts for “net overseas migration”. Net overseas migration is forecast to be 400,000 in 2022-23, followed by 315,000 the next year and 260,000 in each of the following three years. The Coalition has added these together to come up with the “1.5 million immigrants” figure. The budget papers explain that these figures are part of a post-pandemic catch-up and are driven by “a rapid recovery in the stock of international students, skilled temporary visa holders and working holiday makers”. At the same time, the budget says, “very low temporary migrant arrivals during the pandemic now means fewer departures – those who did not arrive cannot now leave”: The budget explains: The elevated forecast for net overseas migration in 2023–24 is largely driven by fewer temporary migrants departing Australia than usual, rather than a greater number of people arriving. Total net overseas migration “is not expected to catch up to the level forecast prior to the pandemic until 2029–30” and the total population is still expected to be 750,000 people smaller in June 2031 compared with pre-pandemic forecasts. The Coalition’s shadow ministry bench is looking a little bare this QT – Angus Taylor, Dan Tehan and Jason Wood have not made it into the chamber as yet. Social services industry responds to Victorian budget Victoria’s peak social services body says the state budget has delivered a “mixed bag” but helps shield struggling households from tough decisions. Emma King, head of the Victorian council of social services, said it was a tough budget, pointing to cuts to employment services and energy concessions. But she pointed to the funding injections for helping teenagers at risk of dropping out of schools and reducing Aboriginal children in out-of-home care as positive measures. While we’re repaying the Covid debt, this [budget is] largely sparing vulnerable Victorians. The first dixer (a government MP asking a government minister a question, which is usually written by the either the minister’s office or the tactics committee) is on the Indian prime minister Modi’s visit. Everyone loves Modi is the general vibe of Albanese’s answer. Question time is about to begin – but first we have to get through the airing of the grievances/MP amateur stand up known as the 90-second statements. … And we are now straight into it with the latest version of “why does (middle) Australia always suffer under a Labor government” which is the Coalition’s latest obsession. Anthony Albanese reads through the usual laundry list: I am asked about middle Australia. It cares about the wages. Wages are increasing under this government. Middle Australia cares about their kids getting access to cheaper childcare. I tell you what middle Australia cares about, particularly in the regions, they care about manufacturing jobs, that’s what middle Australia cares about. I tell you what middle Australia cares about, they want to go to the doctor for free and receive bulk billing and 11 million Australians in middle Australia will be able to do that as a result of this government’s actions. I tell you what middle Australia cares about, they want to pay less for medicines and under our government they will. Middle Australia cares about – when it comes to aged care workers, 250,000 will receive a pay increase. That’s what middle Australia cares about. They [the Coalition] are so out of touch, they only talk to each other about themselves – they should get out there and talk to middle Australia about what their concerns are. Perhaps it was better Japan’s PM Fumio Kishida isn’t visiting Australia this week as there might be a few awkward hydrogen conversations. Back in April, we flagged here that Japan’s $500m plan to use Victorian brown coal to produce hydrogen had some big challenges to clear. Not least of them was a reluctance by the Japanese consortium to secure offtake agreements that would last more than about a couple of years. In other words, after a short period they could walk away and source the hydrogen from somewhere else, leaving Victorians to find new customers (and also deal with the captured carbon emissions). The 2023-24 federal budget dealt one blow to the plans by not offering any more money to the $50m the commonwealth had already tipped in. Guardian Australia understands the debate within the Victorian government was quite willing, with the treasurer, Tim Pallas (with encouragement from media outlets such as the AFR), the main proponent for tipping in more funds. The consortium had hoped the feds and Vics would double their $100m subsidy. Anyway, the 2023-24 Victorian budget had allocated zero money for the project, which we have to assume puts it literally on the back burner. Government has spent over $2.6bn in disaster recovery payments over last year The government has paid out more than $2.6bn for natural disaster recovery in the past year, the emergency management minister, Murray Watt, has told Senate estimates. That includes about $1.5bn in disaster recovery payments and allowances for individuals. Watt said: This is money paid directly into the pockets of people doing it tough as a result of a disaster. We’ve also paid out more than $590m for projects that build community resilience through commonwealth programs. OK, we are now less than 20 minutes away from the next question time, so go grab what you need to get through the next hour and a bit. I won’t judge. The head of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Paul Guerra, says the state government’s budget – which includes a “Covid debt repayment” levy for big business – will “directly impact jobs and investment”. He says in a statement: The government says this is the plan to pay off the ‘COVID credit card debt’ but they’re doing that by using medium to large businesses and property owners as an ATM over the next 10 years. It’s certainly a departure from the ‘all in it together’ approach taken throughout the pandemic and this will directly impact jobs and investment in Victoria. There are some positive initiatives including funding for manufacturing, major events, exports, renewable energy and training. The Victorian Chamber also welcomes the stamp duty reform and the payroll tax offsets for smaller enterprises, but this Budget will be remembered for job cuts and tax hikes. Government denies Chinese media reports Australia opposes Taiwanese membership to regional trade agreement The Australian government says it has not shifted position on a major regional trade pact, after a report today claimed that the trade minister, Don Farrell, had told his Chinese counterpart that Australia did not support Taiwan’s membership. Both China and Taiwan – the self-governed democracy that Beijing claims as a wayward province – are seeking to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Australian government’s longstanding position is that its initial focus is on the UK’s entry to the CPTPP, and that any other applicants would need to demonstrate high standards. That is a signal that, at a minimum, Beijing must remove trade impediments on a range of Australian export sectors before it could even be considered. Any new entrants must also be accepted unanimously by all existing CPTPP members, which is seen as a high barrier to entry. The issue is back in the spotlight because the South China Morning Post today quoted anonymous sources as saying that Beijing had sought “a clear commitment from Australia, preferably public” that Canberra would support China’s bid to join the CPTPP and “deny Taiwan’s membership” during Farrell’s trip to Beijing earlier this month. The most contentious element of the SCMP report is the claim that Farrell told Beijing that Australia “did not support the Taiwanese membership”. Guardian Australia understands the CPTPP was raised by the Chinese side during the meeting, and that Beijing reiterated its publicly stated opposition to Taiwan acceding to the deal. The Chinese government also requested that China be the next applicant considered for entry to the CPTPP. But a source said today that Farrell had not made any comments about Taiwan. Farrell issued a statement today regarding his recent meeting in Beijing with the Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao. Farrell said: On the matter of CPTPP accessions, I indicated that the membership was currently focussed on finalising the United Kingdom’s accession. I reiterated that any economy that sought to accede to the CPTPP must have a demonstrated track record of complying with trade agreements. I also indicated that Australia would work with the CPTPP membership to consider all accession applications on a consensus basis. AEC says guidance on referendum pamphlet submissions to be sent to politicians next week The AEC says it is working with politicians to prepare the referendum pamphlet, which will go to all households. Commissioner Tom Rogers told Senate estimates that the AEC would write to all politicians in the next week with information about the process, which would include guidance on points like fonts and formatting. Answering technical questions about how the formatting will need to be done, and what the AEC will do, Rogers said: “whatever you give us is going in that booklet”. The pamphlet will be delivered to all homes, and be available online plus at polling places. The pamphlet will be translated into a number of languages, including dozens of Indigenous languages. For some languages which are oral-only, the AEC is working on audio files to share the info in the pamphlet. Monique Ryan welcomes decision to end native logging by end of 2023 Independent Kooyong MP Dr Monique Ryan has also welcomed the decision by the Victorian government to bring forward the end to native forest logging to the end of this year, congratulating “the many volunteers, environmental organisations, community groups, and political candidates who have worked tirelessly for many years to achieve this end”: Together, we have saved our beautiful Victorian native forests. Victoria’s native forests are unlike any other. They have historic beauty, and hold an extraordinary diversity of fungi, plant and animal life. According to the experts, the decision to end native forest logging six years earlier than planned is akin to preventing the carbon emissions from 730,000 cars every year. Preserving these carbon stores is a vital part of our efforts to move to a strong, clean economy of the future. Ryan is also a fan of the $200m transition package for workers. Success has many fathers – or, in this instance, fathers and mothers. Among the many voices who’ve called for this change in recent years are the two recent state independent candidates from my own community – Sophie Torney of Kew, and Melissa Lowe, from Hawthorn. … Today is a really happy day for all Victorians who care for our forests, our environment, and our climate. We’ll keep working together to protect these assets – for ourselves and for our children. For those who just want the numbers on the Victorian budget: Infrastructure department says it has had no contact with Larrakia people over Middle Arm hub [continued from previous post] The department also says it has had no contact with the Larrakia people who have raised concerns about the project and says that responsibility and any commentary about what industries would use the site lies with the Northern Territory government. The independent senator David Pocock asks whether the department or ministers met with anyone on the federal lobbyist register about the project and where the change in branding for the development to a “sustainable” precinct came from. Both of those questions were taken on notice. Greens and independents question process behind NT’s Middle Arm development In an estimates hearing for the infrastructure department today, Greens and independent senators have been asking what process was used before the government decided it would take a $1.5bn equity stake in the Northern Territory’s proposed Middle Arm development. Guardian Australia has reported on concerns about the project’s potential impacts on Larrakia cultural heritage and a document sent to the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, that states the project is seen as a “key enabler” for the export of Beetaloo gas. Both major parties committed to funding the project before the last federal election but officials today have been keen to emphasise the decision was made through a cabinet process by the previous government and in the Albanese government’s October budget “that $1.5bn was not removed”. The Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne asks: Would it be fair to say there hasn’t been a substantive process that has been gone through in the department? The department’s response is not particularly illuminating. I think it would be better to say we provided advice into a cabinet for that process that we can’t speak to. Further details on Victorian budget A little bit more from the Victorian budget; Payroll tax exemptions will also be removed for about 110 high-fee private schools, which will raise $348m in the 2023/24 financial year. The government will also double the levy paid by overseas property investors to 4%, and lift betting taxes from 10% to 15% of wagering revenue, in line with New South Wales. The government has also identified $2.1bn in savings over four years, including reducing the public service by 3,000-4,000 workers – described as a return to “pre-pandemic levels” – and scaling back the use of labour hire and consultancy firms. The budget, however, has allocated funding to every election commitment made during the November election campaign. As already reported, it also brings forward the end date to native timber logging in the state from 2030 to 2024. Albanese to party room: there’s ‘plenty of work ahead for us’ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, addressed Labor caucus earlier today, one year on from when he and four colleagues were sworn in as ministers of the new government. Albanese said: We should never take for granted that we have the opportunity to be in government. As long as we stay disciplined, united and focused we can stay in this room. People see us as an adult government with a sense of purpose, that is disciplined, and doing its job ... We’ve been determined to deliver on our commitments. The key thing people remember from the budget is its tripling of bulk billing incentives. Albanese referred to Labor’s housing policies, listing elements including the increase in rental assistance, and the housing Australia future fund “which the Coalition and the Greens are holding back”. Albanese paid tribute to Penny Wong and Pat Conroy for their international work re-engaging with the Pacific, particularly on climate change. He said “action on climate change is the entry fee for credibility at international meetings”. Albanese referred to the visit by the Indian prime minister Modi, and the US president, Joe Biden, needing to stay home due to debt ceiling issues. While unfortunate, Albanese said there was a “domestic and international interest in avoiding a US default”. Albaese said he was proud of where Labor up to but not complacent. “There’s no hubris, plenty of work ahead of us,” he said. Victorian treasurer introduces new levies to help pay down ‘Covid debt’ Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, has handed down his ninth budget in parliament, which introduces two new levies that are expected to raise $8.6bn over the next four years, in an effort to pay down the state’s $31.5bn of “Covid debt”. From July, businesses that pay more than $10m in wages nationally – 5% of the state’s employers – will pay a “Covid debt levy” via a payroll tax surcharge of 0.5% for their Victorian employees. Businesses with national payrolls above $100m pay a 1% surcharge. From January 2024, Victorians who pay a land tax will be hit with an additional annual fee of $500 for total landholdings worth between $50,000 and 100,000 and $975 for land worth between $100,000 and $300,000. For most land worth more than $300,000, an additional hike of 0.1% of total land values will be charged. Family homes will be exempt from the changes, which Pallas said will affect 860,000 landowners who will pay an average of $1,300 in additional taxes annually. He has told parliament: We know some did better out of the pandemic than others - and it’s only fair that those that did well contribute to the repayment effort ... business profits are up 24% over the past three years compared with the previous three. Land values have increased 84% in the past 10 years. We’ve structured the repayment plan in a way that’s responsible and proportionate to those with an ability to pay. Emergency management agency head agrees climate change is causing overlapping fire seasons Climate change means the northern and southern hemisphere fire seasons are increasingly overlapping, Senate estimates has heard. The Greens senator Nick McKim asked the National Emergency Management Agency about the ongoing availability of resources to tackle fires, particularly in remote areas of Tasmania. Australia currently leases some helicopters from countries in the northern hemisphere. McKim asked NEMA’s commissioner, Brendan Moon, if he accepted that the higher fire risk periods between the northern and southern hemispheres were starting to overlap “to a greater degree than they did previously as a result of global warming”. He responded: There’s absolutely no doubt that there’s an overlap there, and we’re exploring what that means. Queensland removes bill that stopped UN officials from visiting detention facilities last year The Queensland government has passed a bill to remove legislative barriers that prohibited UN officials from visiting places of detention during their visit to Australia last year. A UN anti-torture subcommittee suspended its tour of Australian detention facilities in October after Guardian Australia revealed Queensland refused access to some mental health facilities that hold people charged with crimes, while NSW blocked inspectors from entering all of its detention facilities. The former attorney general Shannon Fentiman said in parliament in March the bill was “another commitment ... to uphold human rights in Queensland”. It recognises that the observance of human rights is the most effective and safe way to manage custodial environments. Fentiman said access to the facilities had been limited to preserve people’s “safety and privacy” but the subcommittee was offered the opportunity to interview staff offsite and request information before their arrival. NSW now remains the only Australian jurisdiction to refuse entry to inspectors. While the housing future fund debate continues between Labor and the Greens, this was a particularly awkward moment for Labor’s Higgins MP, Dr Michelle Ananda-Rajah, last night on the ABC’s Q&amp;A. AEC outlines yes and no essay guidelines for voice referendum pamphlets (Continued from previous post) The first questions, from the shadow special minister of state, Jane Hume, was on the official information pamphlets - which include essays written by politicians who vote yes and no in parliament. Rogers said if the AEC doesn’t receive one of the essays on time (within the 28-day window), the pamphlet will go out with only one case – while if an essay arrives without meeting the guidelines (ie if it was over 2,000 words) it would be rejected “in its entirety”. Laws governing the referendum do not state what process should be used to write the essays, but Guardian Australian understands the government is considering setting up large parliamentary committees to write the essays by consensus. Rogers said the AEC would deal with the essays when they come in, after being generated through “whatever parliamentary process”. Rogers said the AEC would make no alterations to an essay (even to correct spelling mistakes) and wouldn’t make editorial decisions like changing bold headings. AEC commissioner raises concerns on online harm and violence against poll workers The Australian Electoral Commission has raised concerns about violence against poll workers in the leadup to the voice referendum. In evidence to Senate estimates, the AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers, said 2023 represented “the most challenging, unpredictable, complex and yet exciting epoch in the AEC’s history”, noting domestic and global challenges around the electoral process. Against a backdrop of increasing threats to electoral integrity, escalating electoral costs, supply chain disruptions, recruitment challenges and ageing systems, the AEC continues to prepare for a referendum and the next general election, whenever that may be, and at least one byelection. The information ecosystem was entirely different at the time of the last referendum, with no social media. We’re already seeing an increase in disinformation on social media, and a regrettable increase in threatening commentary. We’re adapting our approach to manage this for the referendum, including protecting our own staff from online harm. We’re seeing a more unpredictable information environment every day, requiring us to navigate far more challenges than ever before. Pay ‘No 1’ issue driving early education staff losses, SA royal commission hears Jim Chalmers was asked about whether the government will step in and raise child care wages yesterday and he said that first the multi-employer bargaining process had to be given a chance to get underway. AAP reports on the South Australian royal commission into child care with the commission being told poor pay rates being one of the reasons for a the continued exodus from the sector. United Workers Union’s executive director of early learning, Helen Gibbons, said pay wasn’t the only issue driving the loss of more than 30% of staff each year, but it remained the most important. “It’s not just about being able to pay their bills, it’s also about how they feel valued by the community,” Gibbons told South Australia’s royal commission into early childhood education and care on Tuesday. “How much you’re paid is a really concrete expression of how much the community values the work that you do. “I really want to stress that that is the key driver, absolutely the No 1 issue. Our educators tell us very clearly that if you don’t fix that, you don’t fix the sector.” Lengthy debate on referendum legislation to push out House sitting times There are another 81 MPs who want to speak on the referendum legislation bill, which comes on top of the 20 who spoke yesterday. That means to get through them all, the house is going to have to sit later (they have been trying to do “family friendly” hours but that is not going to work this week). Tony Burke told the chamber, in asking to amend the hours it sits: … that means tonight and tomorrow night the debate will continue until 10pm. If you are listed to speak on the adjournment, those speeches will still happen between 7:30 and 8pm tonight and tomorrow night. And there is still no intention that we have a vote on the bill itself until next week. So there will be some late nights ahead for house MPs. Senators, who have not had a sitting week where there hasn’t been some sort of change and extension of hours, are trying to muster up some sympathy for their house colleagues, I’m sure. Elsewhere, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared again that his party would oppose the referendum bill in parliament – despite Peter Dutton previously saying the Liberals were inclined to support it, and allow the referendum to occur. Littleproud admitted “mistakes were made” during British settlement in relation to Indigenous Australians, but believed Australians would be “stronger working together with Indigenous Australians rather than apart”. Littleproud also called for a “respectful” debate around the voice. Dutton did not mention the voice in the Coalition party room, nor the official information pamphlet. Shadow defence minister calls for Aukus joint standing committee Back in the Coalition meeting, the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, renewed his calls for the government to set up a parliamentary joint standing committee on Aukus, saying there was the need for a “clearing house” for legislation around the military pact. In the meeting, Hastie discussed a government bill on nuclear naval propulsion to back up the nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired under the Aukus deal. Hastie said there was a strategic need for the Coalition to back this bill, raising concerns about some on the crossbench opposing it. In that debate, there was talk about the Aukus committee Hastie previously proposed in a letter to the defence minister, Richard Marles, last year. In February, Hastie said the Aukus committee would send an important signal to the US and the UK “that this parliament is serious about seeing Aukus through, through multiple governments”. The government has not taken up that suggestion, Hastie noted. Final bids on failed solar project Sun Cable to be taken today Back in January, billionaires Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes fell out over their plans to develop giant solar farms in the Northern Territory to supply electricity via a cable to Singapore. The company that both had invested in, Sun Cable, was put into administration. The plan was always ambitious, requiring up as much as $30bn, with some of the economics looking challenging, as we noted in this piece. Anyway, the voluntary administrators are taking their final bids today (with the AFR today citing offers would land in the $100m range). FTI Consulting said the announcement about the winning bid will “potentially occur towards the end of this week to early next week”, a spokesperson said. It’s possible, of course, that neither Twiggy or MCB wins out and both will then share some of the spoils to limit their investment losses so far. (MCB’s Grok and Twiggy’s Squadron energy declined to comment on their bids.) A report out today by Bloomberg New Energy Finance finds Australia will need to invest as much as $US1.9tn ($A2.86tn) by 2050 if it is to reach its net zero emissions goals. That would need 800GW of solar and wind energy, or 21 times the 39GW we had at the end of 2022 (if we exclude a green hydrogen component, the requirement would be about 300GW). How far Australia gets towards that goal will depend on the success of companies like Sun Cable (with or without the cable), hence the interest in this week’s bidding. Queensland ends licences to shoot flying foxes This news may really upset Bob Katter (those of you didn’t cover Queensland politics for years may not know that Katter ran a campaign to “kill all flying foxes in urban areas” as a solution to stopping the spread of the Hendra virus – giving people permission to shoot flying foxes in their backyard was part of that). Well, now Queensland has become the last jurisdiction to end the issuing of licences to shoot flying foxes, with the outgoing environment minister, Meagan Scanlon, writing to the Humane Society International that she had “made the decision to move away from permitting the shooting of flying-foxes due to ongoing animal welfare concerns”. There will be a three-year phase out of the licences. The HSI statement says that “despite being protected under the Nature Conservation Act 1992, Damage Mitigation Permits (DMPs) were issued to orchardists in Queensland to shoot three species of flying-fox: the black flying-fox, little red flying-fox and grey-headed flying-fox, in an effort to reduce crop damage”. Not only was it inhumane and dangerous, it was also less effective than placing netting over the crops. The Greens are pushing for all native logging states to follow Victoria’s lead. Dutton stresses Coalition must work together to win Fadden byelection [continued from previous post] Dutton, addressing the room, had a renewed focus on the “working poor” in Australia, raising concerns about cost of living and energy prices, as well as industrial relations reforms mooted by the government. He noted popular public support for his proposed gambling ad ban. The government has criticised Dutton for not outlining more substantial policy ideas in his budget reply. Dutton told the room the Coalition “needn’t rush to failure” in dashing out new policies, saying more policies would come “in due course” – noting the need for their ideas to be considered, costed and ready to be debated. Robert, who formalised his retirement from politics last week, will be replaced in a byelection for the Gold Coast seat of Fadden in July. You may remember the last byelection triggered by a retiring opposition member didn’t go so well for Peter Dutton - so the opposition leader stressed the Coalition needed to work together to ensure they didn’t lose this one too. Peter Dutton has told the Coalition he doesn’t want to “rush to failure” by putting out too many policies early in his term as opposition leader, and told his troops they need to “work together as a team” to win the Fadden byelection and hold Stuart Robert’s seat. The Coalition partyroom met this morning in Canberra, their first get-together since Dutton’s budget reply speech two weeks ago. Nationals leader David Littleproud addressed the meeting to praise the “vision and principles” outlined in Dutton’s speech, criticising the government’s budget as a “welfare budget” that he claimed would push inflation up (many leading economists and the treasury department disagree). Littleproud claimed the regions were “being done over” by the government’s infrastructure funding audit. One Coalition member, contributing to the meeting, suggested getting local mayors and other community groups involved in a campaign to oppose the mooted changes to infrastructure funding, which the opposition claims will see smaller regional projects axed (remember, this audit is being done to make sure all the Coalition’s projects announced in government actually meet criteria and weren’t just pork-barrelling ventures – or as infrastructure minister Catherine King described them, “press release projects”) Greens senator Janet Rice calls on Albanese government to bring forward ban on native forest logging The Greens forests spokesperson and Victorian senator Janet Rice wants the Albanese government to follow Victoria’s lead in bringing forward the ban on native forests and stop all native forest logging: Native forest logging is a dying industry and there’s no way around it. If Labor bring on the Greens bill to a vote, we can immediately ban all native forest logging across the country. The Regional Forest Agreements have allowed reckless destruction of native forests for decades across Australia, pushed native wildlife to the brink of extinction, destroyed First Nations heritage, endangered our water supplies, heightened bushfire risk, and made the climate crisis worse. The government has a responsibility to stop this destruction, protect native forests and fix our broken environment laws. The Greens are ready to work with the Albanese government on a national ban on native forest logging, ensure a just transition for forestry workers and protect what remains of our precious native forests.” Australia ‘deeply invested’ in freedom of navigation in South China Sea: Marles Earlier this morning, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, was asked if China’s military buildup kept him up at night. After a back and forth about what China’s motivations were, he said: Well, the point really is we can have a long conversation about that and you’ll get different views on it. But the real point is this: it engages our interest. If you look at the South China Sea, for example, that is a body of water which matters deeply to us. Why? Because most of our trade goes through the South China Sea. And yes, a lot of that trade is to China itself. But all of our trade to Japan, all of our trade to Korea, two of our top five trading partners, goes through the South China Sea. So, we as a nation are deeply invested in the rules of the road applying there – freedom of navigation, freedom of overflight. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea matters to Australia and our way of life, our prosperity, as it applies in the South China Sea and, of course, everywhere else. That is what is part of how we are seeing a much more complex strategic landscape which we need to posture for. And that’s what we’re doing. And that’s at the heart of the defence strategic review, the government’s response to it. It is why we seek to have, for example, long range nuclear-powered submarines. Guardian Australia’s 10th birthday event at the Seymour Centre You can hear from Luke Henriques-Gomes, our social affairs and inequality editor, at our 10th birthday event at the Seymour Centre this Thursday (along with a cast of other superstar reporters and editors at the Guardian) He’ll be talking about reporting on things like this: A taxpayer-funded employability course is under fire after jobseekers complained that much of the compulsory training involved being shown irrelevant, inappropriate and, at-times, bizarre YouTube videos. Under contracts signed by the Coalition last year, the federal government will pay private providers about $500m over five years to run Employability Skills Training (EST) courses as part of the commonwealth’s $7bn Workforce Australia program. On its website, the department says the program offers “practical support” and “helps you become job-ready by providing intensive pre-employment training”. Illicit tobacco market growing, ABF tells Senate estimates The Australian Border Force has seized 73% more cigarettes compared with the same time last year, while for both loose leaf tobacco and cigarettes there has been a 10.5% increase in terms of duty evaded. Criminal syndicates have increasingly become involved in the illicit tobacco market because it’s profitable, and the penalties compared to drug smuggling are lower, Senate estimates has heard. PM to announce workload changes for ministers Looks like there are some workload changes coming for the ministry – there were extra staff allocated for MPs (not just ministers) in the budget, but this looks like a wider acknowledgment that the workload is unsustainable. The Victorian government is set to announce that it will ban native forest logging from the start of next year, reflecting a widely held belief that the industry is not environmentally or economically viable. The announcement, expected in today’s state budget, will bring forward the previous commitment to phase out native forest logging by 2030 and include transition funding for affected workers and communities. It follows the state’s forests being hit by devastating bushfires in 2019-20, reducing the area available for logging, and court decisions finding the state-owned timber agency VicForests had not adequately protected endangered species. Expectations the end was near have grown in recent months. VicForests stopped logging in November after the supreme court judged it had failed to protect the greater glider and yellow-bellied glider. In February, the Maryvale Mill in the Latrobe Valley, the state’s biggest, ended production of office paper in the state, blaming a lack of timber supply. VicForests had already reported a loss of more than $50m last financial year. It is expected the government will announce at least $200m in extra transition funding. The decision is unlikely to be welcomed in parts of regional Victoria that are home to native forest workers. Critics say plantations are not yet in place at a scale that can replace native forest timber. It will be celebrated by the state’s conservation movement, which has fought a decades-long battle to create new national parks and protect forests from clearfelling. Robodebt official given $900,000-a-year Aukus role before royal commission, says Wong The robodebt royal commission will hand down its report on 7 June for those wondering. Paul Karp has an update on Kathryn Campbell’s new role as a defence adviser: Penny Wong has given a qualified defence of a decision to appoint a public servant who held the top jobs at the two departments responsible for robodebt to a plum role as an adviser on Aukus. The foreign minister told Senate estimates that the decision had been made before the royal commission began and evidence that has since come out went “beyond what [she] would’ve anticipated”. Kathryn Campbell was given the $900,000-a-year job in June 2022, leaving her role as the head of the foreign affairs department. The prime minister’s office and department published a transcript which omitted a key part of a journalist’s question about whether the government will call a royal commission into Covid. The omission from the transcript of a 15 May press conference in Adelaide has the effect of qualifying Anthony Albanese’s answer that the government will “examine it” to commit Labor only to consider “some kind of inquiry” but not specifically a royal commission. Under Albanese and his predecessor Scott Morrison, the Australian government has been pressed to call a royal commission into the response to Covid, including by a Senate inquiry chaired by the now finance minister Katy Gallagher when Labor was in opposition. The call is supported by the former independent senator Rex Patrick and a number of Labor, crossbench and Coalition senators. On 15 May, a journalist asked Albanese: “You have committed to some kind of inquiry like a royal commission into Australia’s handling of Covid, but there was nothing on this in the budget. When do you plan on calling one?” But the transcript, distributed by the prime minister’s office and published by the department, rendered the question: “You have committed to some kind of inquiry into Australia’s handling of Covid, but there was nothing on this budget. When you plan on doing that?” Albanese replied: “Covid is still amongst us. What I’ve said is that when we are confident that we’re through those issues, then we’ll examine it.” Guardian Australia understands the question may not have been clearly audible from the on-site recording, but the prime minister’s office declined to provide it. The question follows numerous instances of Albanese committing to an “examination” of Covid, but not specifically endorsing the Senate committee’s call for a royal commission. On 16 August Albanese told reporters that he has “said consistently that once we were through the pandemic, it would be inconceivable, regardless of who won the election in May, that you would not have a proper examination of the circumstances around the handling of the pandemic”. ACIJ calls for sanctions in response to targeting of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh This morning, Richard Marles dodged questions on whether Anthony Albanese should raise the treatment of Muslims and minorities in India with Narendra Modi, but the Australian Centre for International Justice has made a submission (and a follow-up submission) to Penny Wong asking for action on what it says are ongoing human rights violations in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. From its statement: Our 75-page submission, prepared in consultation with affected members of the diaspora, set out evidence of the individuals’ respective involvement in violations of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It focused on systematic campaigns carried out by members of the Uttar Pradesh police, in which Muslims (a religious minority in India) were disproportionately targeted. The submission argued that domestic accountability for these abuses is highly unlikely and that efforts by survivors and the families of victims to seek justice in India have been met with intimidation, threats and harassment by police. The ACIJ wants Australia to use is Magnitsky human rights sanctions regime to sanction those it says are responsible for what is happening in Uttar Pradesh. Albanese will join Modi at a community event in Sydney this evening, with a bilateral meeting to be held tomorrow at Admiralty House. “We don’t just lock people up and forget about them,” home affairs secretary Michael Pezzullo has told senate estimates. Greens senator Nick McKim immediately replied: You certainly do. They were discussing comments from UN special rapporteur on torture, Anne Edwards, who said it was “inhumane” to detain people indefinitely. Pezzullo said there were “terminus points” for all refugees and asylum seekers, including trying to send them back to their country of origin, and that no one was detained “potentially eternally”. The department took on notice a request for more details on the length of time people are being detained for. Party rooms meeting before house sits at midday Senators are busy with estimates hearings, but the house won’t sit until midday. That’s for the party room meetings to occur, which means Tuesday morning is usually a little quiet at this time of the day, as most MPs are locked away hearing about how great everything their party is doing and how terrible the other parties are. Legislation gets discussed, concerns are raised, and updates on policy are given. Then the media are called in for a background briefing to hear what went on. Security pact between US and PNG a ‘very positive’ thing, says Marles If you didn’t see this yesterday, the US has signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea. As AAP reports, Richard Marles says Australia sees that as a positive step: The fact that America is walking down this path is something that we certainly see as being very positive and we will continue to work with PNG in terms of developing our own friends. More than 200 asylum seekers turned away by Operation Sovereign Borders in past year, Senate estimates hears Eight boats holding more than 200 asylum seekers have been turned back under Operation Sovereign Borders in the past year. OSB commander, rear admiral Justin Jones, said: Over the last year we’ve had eight boats and 209 people attempt journeys to Australia – all have been successfully resolved … returned to their place of origin safely and in accordance with Australia’s domestic and international legal obligations. The socioeconomic crisis in Sri Lanka and other global and regional factors have led to an increased “tempo” of asylum seeker boats, he said, and people smugglers would continue targeting vulnerable people, spreading misinformation and “outright lies” to increase demand for their services. As Senate estimates has also turned its attention to “on-water matters”, home affairs secretary Michael Pezzullo was asked about reports that 41 asylum seekers had been picked up and returned to Sri Lanka in April. It’s a longstanding practice … we don’t discuss operational matters pertaining to Operation Sovereign Borders except in so far as we have a monthly reporting cycle. He suggested that the media sometimes got the wrong end of the stick and that people may have, for example, been picked up from a trawler that got into trouble (but he wasn’t talking about any specific on-water matter). Officials told estimates there were no planned upgrades to security on Christmas Island (the topic of another report) but that OSB was always prepared for more arrivals. Qantas is on track to deliver a record net profit of up to $2.48bn this financial year amid surging travel demand, representing a sharp turnaround for the national carrier. The forecast full year result to 30 June is underpinned by a flying schedule that is now more profitable than before the pandemic, Qantas disclosed in a market update on Tuesday morning. The result could be almost $1bn higher than its prior record in 2018, which came in at $1.6bn. Qantas’s profit margins have been helped by huge demand for domestic and international flights, high ticket prices and various cost savings. Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said lower jet fuel prices were helping put downward pressure on fares, although he noted there was still excess demand. The industry remains capacity constrained and the travel category remains strong, so there’s still a mismatch between supply and demand that’s likely to persist for some time, especially for international flying. Many airlines are now recording bumper profits due in part to pent-up demand and high fares, after recording years of pandemic-disrupted losses. Qantas’s chief financial officer, Vanessa Hudson, will take over from Joyce as the airline’s chief executive in November. Monash University backs Indigenous voice to parliament Monash University has become the latest university to back the voice to parliament with the launch of a series of speaker sessions on the upcoming referendum. The series, launching this week, features prominent Indigenous Australians and legal experts including Wiradjuri and Wailwan woman and senior lawyer Teela Reid, Whadjuk Noongar woman and commentator Narelda Jacobs and Prof Luke Beck. The vice-chancellor of Monash, Prof Margaret Gardner, said the university council unanimously supported the Uluru Statement of the Heart. We are committed to actively engaging in conversations and actions that promote a more equitable and inclusive society for all Australians.” Prof Tristan Kennedy, the pro vice-chancellor and a Noongar man, said facilitating an informed discourse in the lead up to the referendum was crucial. Higher education institutions have a responsibility and are in a privileged position to facilitate robust conversations about matters like this that affect everyone in the community, that’s what I see Monash University being able to do in 2023. Universities Australia, the peak body for the sector, has withheld from actively backing the yes campaign, but a number of tertiary institutions have come out to announce their support. Among them are Charles Darwin University, ANU, UNSW, the University of Wollongong, Swinburne and Curtin University, with others remaining in negotiation over their institutional positions. ‘Significant uptick’ in cocaine seizures, says border force commissioner ABF commissioner Michael Outram has confirmed a “significant uptick” in cocaine seizures, with 100 companies and 1,000 employees of “concern” when it comes to smuggling. Outram was responding to last night’s Four Corners episode “Cocaine Nation”, which featured an underworld whistleblower’s claims about Mexican and South American cartels importing tonnes of drugs into Australia. He said: What we’ve identified through undertaking Operation Jardine over the last year and a half is probably about 100 companies that deeply concern us – they’re operating at the border in different contexts within airports, seaports, the supply chain, customs brokerages … depots, warehouses, etc. And [there are] about 1,000 employees that concern us. Outram said the ABF was “pretty stretched” tackling the issue and that he was concerned people would think ABF officers were involved, although he conceded the force was not “immune” to corruption: I would never say that any organisation is impenetrable particularly when you think of the depths of the pockets that organised crime has. So I’ve been very cautious [but] no organisation is immune, including mine. Border force continued trial of Chinese-made drones after US and ADF stopped, estimates hears The Australian border force continued a trial of drones made by Chinese company DJI for several days because the “risks were low and manageable”, commissioner Michael Outram told Senate estimates this morning. The US stopped using DJI drones because of their links to the Chinese military, and the Australian defence force stopped using them on 5 May. Outram said he initially continued a trial because the ABF has a different security classification and was using them for things such as spotting illegal tobacco crops. But on 8 May, after further briefings, he suspended the trial “out of an abundance of caution” because it had become a “whole-of-government issue”. More than 150,000 taking up fee-free Tafe, says skills minister The skills minister, Brendan O’Connor, says more than 150,000 people have taken up the government’s offer of fee-free Tafe so far: More than 65,000 students in NSW Over 26,000 in both Victoria and Queensland More than 12,000 people with disability Almost 35,000 jobseekers Nationwide, almost 30% of all enrolments have been in courses related to the care sector – an area of high priority. Qantas forecasts before-tax profits of about $2.4bn for financial year I am sure all of you will be as shocked by this news as I was – Qantas is reporting a before tax profit of about $2.4bn. That follows its $1.4bn half year profit. Qantas says “continued strong travel demand and completion of its three-year recovery program” are the main drivers of the financial year “underlying profit before tax of between $2,425 million and $2,475 million”. It has headlined: Estimated underlying profit before tax of $2,425 million-$2,475 million for FY23. Net debt of $2,700 million-$2,900 million expected at 30 June 2023. Fuel prices, costs associated with operational buffer and fares all moderating. On-market buy-back increased by up to $100 million. On-track to share benefits of recovery with employees. Shocked. NT government knew it could not reduce climate risk when it greenlit ‘carbon bomb’ gas production in Beetaloo Basin Meanwhile, Lisa Cox has an update on the Beetaloo Basin: New documents reveal the Northern Territory government knew it could not meet a key recommendation to reduce the climate risk of its planned massive expansion of gas production, and asked the Albanese government for help. Federal climate change officials in turn admitted Australia did not have any existing policies that would meet the recommendation in full. Advocates say the documents are proof the Northern Territory government lied when it claimed all the conditions were in place to give the green light to gas production in the Beetaloo Basin, an area of vast shale reserves 500km south-east of Darwin. It looks like estimates is going really well: Hourly wage gap between casual and permanent workers highest on record at 28%, ACTU research shows AAP has looked at some Australian Council of Trade Unions research showing the pay gap between permanent and casual workers: Australia’s casual workers are getting paid significantly less than their permanent counterparts, with the hourly pay gap reaching an all-time high. Casuals generally earn $11.59 less an hour than permanent workers, or an hourly rate of $28.95 against $40.54, a pay gap of 28%, ACTU research shows. The pay differential is the highest on record. Employees with the same skill level or occupation had a smaller pay gap of between $3.55 and $3.84 an hour, equating to a discrepancy of about 11%. The union noted the gap existed despite casuals receiving a pay loading of up to 25% and it called for the Albanese government to scrap “Morrison-era changes to the law”. The government should also introduce a commonsense definition of casual work as part of its industrial relations reforms because too many jobs were casual “in name only”, it said. Gambling reform alliance CEO praises Zoe Daniel’s ad ban bill amid ‘white hot public anger’ against betting industry The Alliance for Gambling Reform has welcomed Goldstein independent MP Zoe Daniel’s private member’s bill to ban the broadcast of gambling ads. The government has tried to put the issue on ice by saying it is waiting for the review it ordered of online gambling ads to come back first (there is a small component of the review which will take in broadcast ads). But CEO of the gambling reform alliance, Carol Bennett, said Daniel’s bill showed “a political leadership” she hoped the government would follow. “There is white hot public anger at the tsunami of gambling ads that are on our screens. Parents are furious that they are not able to protect their children from a gambling industry that is both ruthless and predatory and which targets young people.” But Bennett also hoped any forthcoming ban would go further than even Daniel’s bill: But as good as this bill is, it does not go far enough, there must also be urgent government action to ban gambling ads on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and Snapchat. Nearly half of those seeking Australian homelessness charity’s help have jobs but can’t pay soaring rents If you haven’t seen this report from Jordyn Beazley on who is accessing help from Mission Australia, it is well worth your time: Four in 10 people who sought help from a major homelessness charity in the past three years were employed but could not meet skyrocketing rents, according to a report by Mission Australia. The report comes as the demand for the organisation’s homelessness services, mainly based in New South Wales, jumped by 26% to 7,378 people between January 2020 to December last year. The number of people seeking help who were already homeless increased by 50% in three years to more than 3,500 people – mainly due to inadequate supply or affordable housing, the report said. No case ‘zeroed in’ on inclusion of ‘executive government’ in referendum, Leeser says Does Julian Leeser accept that his proposal to remove “executive government” from the question will not get ahead? Leeser: Well, look, obviously the bill is going to pass the House of Representatives in the next fortnight where the government has the majority and the government is sticking with its wording – at least that’s what the minister said yesterday – but it’s quite a few more weeks to run in the Senate. The reason I have put this forward is not that I don’t believe that the voice should be able to advise the executive. But when I read and paid attention to the full sweep of the debate yesterday, the no case is zeroed in on this point. And I think having that second clause in there is making it more difficult for Australians to vote yes. And I want to see the yes case win and win handsomely and I think the best, best way for it to win is to try and encourage as many Australians as possible to vote yes. And I think we can achieve that and achieve a strong voice by amending that second clause. Leeser dodges question on Linda Burney’s ‘misinformation and disinformation’ comments on Dutton The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney said Dutton’s claims were “misinformation and disinformation”. Does Julian Leeser agree? Leeser dodges the question: I think it’s important that the yes case and the no case each put their best arguments forward. I’ve always said one of the reasons I’m on the yes case and not the no case is that I’ve always thought that it was a reasonable thing to have this body and have a body that is specifically designed to improve the policy outcomes for Aboriginal people for two reasons, firstly, because they’re the only people that we make laws about on the basis of their race. And secondly, because this is a wonderful country where, you know, by global standards, our social and economic indicators, the best in the world, but we have a gap that Aboriginal people face and we haven’t been able to close that gap. And I believe consulting people on the laws and policies that affect them, will help us improve. We’re addressing things like Indigenous homelessness, employment, housing, safety, education and economic advancement. That’s why I think this is a good thing. Leeser: ATSI people the only group for whom laws are made ‘on the basis of their race’, making voice a ‘reasonable’ move The interview moves on and Julian Leeser is asked about party leader Peter Dutton’s comments in his speech yesterday that the voice would “re-racialise” Australia. Leeser, who stepped away from the shadow frontbench so he could campaign for the yes vote, said: I’m not going to be responsible for commenting on other people’s comments. I’m going to responsible for the words that I say. I think that the voice will play an important role in Australia and it will play an important role because we know that you make better public policy when you consult people that are directly affected by the laws and policies that are made about them. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the only people that we make laws about on the basis of their race. It’s therefore a reasonable thing that they should be consulted about the effect of those laws and policies. And that’s why we’re having the voice – it recognises Aboriginal people and it provides for a permanent institution for consultation and that should lead to better public policymaking. ‘Everybody has a responsibility’ to improve public debate, Leeser says when asked about mainstream media Asked again about the responsibility of the media – mainstream media – Julian Leeser says: Well, I think everybody has a responsibility to lift the standard of public debate in this country. And I think I always try and conduct myself in a way where we play the ball and not the person, and I think that that’s a really important principle. And I’m really sad that it’s had this effect on Stan [Grant]. I’ve reached out to him personally, and I hope we see him resuming his public role again soon. Which again doesn’t address the substantive issue at the heart of the question. The media can be notoriously bad at taking on board criticism or responding as needed (and yes, I am part of the media I am talking about). It doesn’t help when politicians are also not willing to call out when lines are crossed. Julian Leeser ‘shocked’ at social media comments directed at Stan Grant The former shadow attorney general Julian Leeser was next up on ABC radio RN Breakfast where he too was asked about the treatment of Stan Grant. Leeser had been on the ABC panel which played ahead of the coronation and had already spoken out against the “unrelenting racism online”. Asked if he was worried about the media’s responsibility in conducting conversations around race and Indigenous people and history, Leeser said: Let me firstly say again, that I’ve been horrified at some of the things that have been said about Stan Grant, in fact, I said it the day after I’d appeared on that coronation panel with him. I was just shocked at some of the things that were being said about him on social media and he’s copped that sort of thing for a long time. He’s a good journalist. He’s a fair journalist and a fair man. And I think we all have to be better at having difficult conversations in our country and doing so in a respectful manner. And I said in the context of the coming referendum that it’s really important that both sides engage respectfully. It’s important that advocates for the yes case listen to the reasonable concerns of those who doubt, and advocates for the no case listen to the hopes and aspirations of Indigenous people that they think the voice can bring them. And I think that applies more broadly. We’ve got to have a more respectful conversation and I think sometimes social media commentary and so on doesn’t help that. Again, you’ll notice that the answer focuses on social media. And there are problems with social media, but the question was on “the media”. Victoria to introduce big business tax to help pay for Covid-19 debt Big business is set to be slugged with a new tax to help repay billions of dollars worth of emergency funds borrowed by the Victorian government at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Tuesday afternoon will hand down his ninth budget, which will detail a “Covid-19 debt repayment plan” that includes new revenue measures and savings to get the state’s borrowings under control. Guardian Australia has confirmed this will include a new levy on “big business” – though it remains unclear how many businesses will be eligible. It comes after Pallas introduced the mental health and wellbeing levy to pay for an overhaul of the state’s system in the budget two years ago, to fund reforms to the state’s mental health system. Marles encourages ‘sensitivity’ from both news organisations and social media users It took asking at least three times for Richard Marles to get to that answer. The inclusion of News Corp’s campaigns against particular journalists at the ABC has seemingly made some politicians uncomfortable. Justin Stevens, the ABC news boss has told News Corp and other media critics to focus on him: “I’m the person who’s responsible ultimately for the journalism and the decisions,” he said. “I’m saying, stop going after people for doing their jobs.” Before agreeing that some of the comments below stories about ABC presenters in publications like the Australian were “revolting”, Marles said: I think every news organisation and everybody who contributes to the public discourse and that includes those who engage in social media need to do so with a sense of sensitivity … and awareness about what people are saying and the way in which their voice is being heard. The conversation moves on to Stan Grant and whether Richard Marles agrees with some of the comments ABC news boss Justin Stevens has made about the criticism Grant experienced by organisations like News Corp and its “relentless campaign”. Marles is asked whether he has read some of the comments under articles about ABC staff which appear in newspapers like the Australian. Patricia Karvelas: Should those newspapers be dealing with the consequences and the commentary? I’ve read some of them I’ve read some of them about myself, too. They’re revolting. Marles: Look, I mean, they are revolting. It’s it’s an area in an age of social media where – where there are comments that are posted, well – anyone who engages in social media, I think we all need to do much better. And the answer the question about why I haven’t read all them is precisely because of the impact which one has when you do read them all. You know, I … do find it very troubling, is the short answer to the question. And I think this is a moment in Stan Grant’s decision for us all to have a long think about it. Australia-China relations ‘dramatically’ more stabilised than a year ago: Marles Should Anthony Albanese accept the invitation to visit Beijing if China hasn’t lifted its trade sanctions? Richard Marles: What we’re trying to do with China and really, this is the whole of this conversation – it is complex, and it is difficult. If people want to try and make something which is very complex and difficult more simple, it just isn’t. What we are trying to do is to stabilise the relationship. And as I say, we will work with China where we can, we will disagree with them where we must. That’s the philosophy that we are taking to stabilise. I think it’s a bit it is more stabilised than it was a year ago, … dramatically so, but it’s not stabilised in the complete vision you have for where you want it. Australia-China relationship ‘complex’ but is ‘a huge opportunity’, says Marles Richard Marles gave a speech overnight where he said Australia “must confront the inconvenient truths about China”. What did he mean by that? Well, the point I was really making is that the China is a is a very complex country, and our relationship with China is obviously correspondingly complex. And it’s not a relationship which can be defined with simplistic platitudes. I think if you wind the clock back a year or more, you know, we had a debate in this country, which was pretty simplistic and didn’t take into account all the nuance of what is a very complex situation. And we need to embrace all of that, you know, we really need to look at the entire picture. I mean, China is a huge opportunity for our country and remains such being our largest trading partner. The that facts has been at the heart of our economic growth over a number of decades. But should Australia raise its concerns? Richard Marles: Well, I mean, we have a very deep and open relationship with India, but I’m not about to go into all of those elements. Now. I’m sure that there will be a full conversation that that both prime ministers have tomorrow, but we want to emphasise that India is a democracy. It’s a country with whom we share values and we do want to see a much bigger growth in the way in which we engage with each other and [cooperate], both on a military level and in terms of our trade. Marles avoids question of whether PM will bring up India’s treatment of Muslims and other minorities with Modi Will Anthony Albanese address the treatment of Muslims and other minorities with Modi, as Joe Biden plans to do when the pair meet later in the year? Marles: I’m not about to go into all that will be spoken about in when the prime minister, our prime minister, meets Prime Minister Modi tomorrow. I think the fundamental point that we want to make is that is that we do have a strategic alignment based on a sense of shared values. I mean, ultimately, we are both democracies. And that very much underpins the way in which we see the world and why we have an interest in building the relationship. Marles confident of shared alignment with India despite silence on Russia India has not condemned Russia. Is Richard Marles confident India is strategically aligned with Australia? Marles: We are confident that India is strategically aligned with Australia and India is a democracy with whom we share values. So that’s that’s the fundamental principle, and we share an interest in having a free and open Indo-Pacific. India and Australia share ‘greater strategic alignment … than we really have at any point’: Marles The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast about Narendra Modi’s visit. The Indian prime minister arrived at about 8pm last night. He and Anthony Albanese will attend a community event in Sydney tonight, with a bilateral meeting planned for tomorrow morning. Marles: I think we have a greater strategic alignment with India today than we really have at any point in both of our country’s histories, and it really does afford the opportunity to take the relationship to the next level, as Prime Minister Modi has said … This is a real opportunity for us, because this year India becomes the largest country in the world by population. It is a growing, massive economy. There are great opportunities for us. And in a security sense, we do both share values and share strategic alignment; we have a real investment together in the rules of the international trade, the global rules based order; we share an ocean, we want to see open trade occurring in all of that. And so we really do have a joint interest in cooperating. For those who missed it last night, Stan Grant signed off from public life for some time, having received ongoing racial abuse for doing his job: Snowy Hydro’s tunnel borer, which has been stuck since 12 December just 70 metres into its work, should resume operations soon, Dennis Barnes, Snowy’s chief, told senate estimates on Monday night. Dubbed “Florence”, the 211 metre-long machine hit soft rock soon after it began the 17km-long tunnel that will be a key part of the giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro scheme. Work has been delayed while crews strengthened the rock around a sink hole that opened up in front of the borer and reached the surface. A separate plant to treat slurry rather than hard rock has had to be built sooner than expected, and should be commissioned by the end of May. Barnes said: Then we should be able to push forward with Florence slightly thereafter. After that, the borer will take “in the order of three years” to finish the tunnel. Barnes said earlier this month that Snowy 2.0 could be delayed by as long as two more years. That could take the commercial start date to 2029 or later, compared with an original target of July 2025. Barnes said the impacts of the delays and additional costs, and remedial efforts to speed up work, will be tallied later this year. The official costs – excluding transmission lines to link the plant to the main grid – are already estimated to be $5.9bn and critics expect them to exceed $10bn (assuming there aren’t other major challenges). Welcome to day two of the parliament sitting – and estimates – as the house continues to be dominated by the referendum legislation debate. Liberal MP Julian Leeser is still looking for support to remove ‘executive government’ from the question, but the government has shown no indications it believes any shift is necessary. There were more than 70 speakers on the list yesterday – although not too many Coalition MPs. One Liberal MP who did make a splash was Bridget Archer who directly countered claims made by her party leader, Peter Dutton who said the voice would divide Australia by racial lines. No, the voice won’t have veto power or act as a third chamber ... To claim otherwise is a deliberate and harmful misrepresentation of the facts, and I’m disappointed to have seen this wilfully perpetuated by some. Nor does the argument that this referendum is dividing the country by race make sense. Anthony Albanese has a busy day – he will be in parliament in Canberra for most of the day, but is then headed to Sydney for a 6pm community event with Narendra Modi in what is the Indian prime minister’s first visit to Australia since 2014. There are also party room meetings, more budget debate and of course, estimates where the Coalition senators are doing their best to drum up a couple of headlines. We will bring you all the news as it happens with me, Amy Remeikis, on the blog. Paul Karp, Daniel Hurst and Josh Butler are keeping the Canberra office buzzing with all you need to know, while the rest of the Guardian brains trust will bring you news from outside Capital Hill. It is at least a two-coffee morning.

It was never a particularly good comparison, because Portillo’s defeat was unexpected, whereas Raab’s is already priced in, but now the only thing it can refer to is the moment the Daily Telegraph dropped last night, with the story that Raab is standing down. Our version is here. Raab, who is only 49, has written a letter to the chair of the Conservative association in Esher and Walton, his constituency, saying that one of the factors behind his decision is “the pressure the job has placed on my young family”. He has two sons, aged 10 and eight. This may well be true. But at Westminster it will be taken for granted that he is announcing his decision to stand down now because he assumes he will lose his seat. His majority over the Liberal Democrats at the last election was just 2,743, and Esther and Walton is one of their top targets. If this were just a one off, it would not be so interesting. But, according to the Spectator’s tally, Raab is the 37th Conservative MP to announce they are standing down at the next general election. That is more than 10% of the parliamentary party – a much higher proportion than is normal at this stage of a general election. What’s more, 12 of the others are, like Raab, under 50. In the twentieth century it was unusual for an MP to leave the Commons voluntarily before reaching retirement age. Career patterns are changing, but that on its own does not explain what is happening (the Labour MPs who have announced that are standing down are all in their 60s, 70s or 80s), and it is hard not to conclude that Raab has joined a cohort of Tories who have given up hope their party will be in government after the next election. Responding to the Raab announcement, a Lib Dem spokesperson said: The local elections in May showed people are fed up with Conservative MPs taking them for granted. It’s not just Dominic Raab who should go, it’s this whole sleaze-ridden Conservative government. We will be fighting hard at the next election to finally give the people of Esher and Walton the strong local champion they deserve. And this is from Monica Harding, the Lib Dem candidate in Esher and Walton. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10am: Claire Coutinho, the children’s minister, gives evidence to the Commons education committee about special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision. 11am: Sunak speaks at the London defence conference. At 3.15pm John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, will be speaking. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion criticising the government for not abolishing or reforming the leasehold system; later there will be a debate on a Labour ‘humble address’ motion calling for the publication of data about the safety of school buildings in England.

Alun Michael, the South Wales police and crime commissioner (PCC), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there was a road traffic collision involving two teenagers on an off-road bike or scooter and that both had died. Police officers faced hours of “large-scale disorder” at the scene near Snowden Road in Ely on Monday with rioters throwing missiles including fireworks at them. Cars were set on fire as trouble flared through the night, involving scores of masked youths. Michael, whose role as PCC involves holding the police to account, said it appeared that incorrect rumours on social media that a police pursuit had led to the crash that killed the teenagers were behind the subsequent disorder. He said: “My understanding is that there was a road traffic accident involving two teenagers on an off-road bike or scooter and sadly they died. That’s an incident that’s being investigated in its own right. “That appeared to spark for reasons that are not clear the disorder in which something like a dozen officers were injured and the connection between the two is far from clear so obviously there’s going to be an investigation to establish what happened. “It appears there were rumours – and those rumours became rife – of a police chase which wasn’t the case. I think it illustrates the speed which rumours can go round with the activity that goes on social media these days and how things can get out of hand.” Michael said that while officers were injured, none of the injuries were life-threatening. He described Ely as an area that had “a lot of deprivation but it’s also a very warm community”. South Wales police later confirmed that the two teenage boys had died. A spokesperson said: “Shortly after 6pm yesterday we received a report of a serious road traffic collision on Snowden Road which resulted in the deaths of two teenage boys. “Police responded to this collision which had already occurred when officers arrived, and they remained on scene to manage a large-scale disorder until the early hours of this morning. Specially trained public order officers were also deployed, including officers from neighbouring police forces. “Several vehicles were set alight, property was damaged and police officers were injured during the incident.” Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis said: “First and foremost our thoughts are with families of the two boys who have died following the collision in Ely and with those affected by the disorder which followed. “These are scenes we do not expect to see in our communities, particularly a close-knit community such as Ely. We received a large number of calls from residents who were understandably frightened by the actions of this large group who were intent on causing crime and disorder. “The level of violence towards emergency services and the damage to property and vehicles was totally unacceptable. Our focus now is to fully investigate the circumstances of the collision and the appalling scenes that followed. “Arrests have been made in connection with the disorder and more will follow. We shall be maintaining an enhanced police presence throughout the week and into the weekend.” Shortly before 3am, rioters moved down Highmead Road in Ely, followed by police who were trying to disperse them. Police, including officers on horseback, were seen outside Ely police station in the early hours of Tuesday after suggestions it could be targeted. Scenes being livestreamed on YouTube showed young people throwing fireworks and other missiles at a line of police officers with riot shields who were blocking one end of the street. A fire was burning and a helicopter could be heard hovering overhead. Shortly before midnight a car was set on fire, while a second vehicle was overturned and set ablaze. One person was attacked due to rioters believing they were an undercover officer, according to one of the senior officers at the scene. The public were warned the road was closed between Wilson Road and Jackson Road and urged to avoid the area. The leader of Cardiff council, Huw Thomas, said: “My thoughts and deepest sympathies this morning are with the families of those young people. This sounds like a truly tragic event and the families, and all of us, need to understand what happened and why. “The best way we can achieve this is by letting the investigation begin as soon as possible. Any further trouble will only delay that investigation and cause more hurt to grieving families.” ”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/may/23/inflation-uk-budget-deficit-april-john-allan-barratt-bank-of-england-imf-economy-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T08:18:02Z","webTitle":"Inflation drives UK borrowing up to £25.6bn in April; John Allan to step down early as Barratt chair – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/23/inflation-uk-budget-deficit-april-john-allan-barratt-bank-of-england-imf-economy-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/may/23/inflation-uk-budget-deficit-april-john-allan-barratt-bank-of-england-imf-economy-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Inflation drives UK borrowing up to £25.6bn in April; John Allan to step down early as Barratt chair – business live","bodyText":"The government pulled in more money from inheritance tax last month. New data from HMRC show that inheritance tax receipts rose to £600m in April, which is £100m higher than a year ago. Alex Davies, CEO and Founder of Wealth Club said: “The 2023/24 tax year is looking likely to be yet another record-breaking year for inheritance tax. It really is a cash cow for HMRC. Currently, people can pass on up to £325,000 of their estate without them having to pay any IHT. Anything above £325,000 could be subject to up to 40% inheritance tax. The nil-rate band has stayed at the same level since April 2009, although asset prices (such as houses) have risen since. Dean Moore, Managing Director and Head of Wealth Planning at RBC Wealth Management, says the freeze on inheritance tax thresholds is pushing up IHT receipts. The burden of IHT on families is reaching unprecedented levels, with a projected record payment of £6.7 billion in the financial year 2022/23. This amount is more than double the £2.9 billion paid in 2011/12, and it is expected to further increase to £7.8 billion within the next five years. “The significant rise in IHT is primarily driven by sustained increases in property prices and the long-term freeze of the IHT threshold which is unchanged at £325,000 since 2009. Meanwhile, average house prices in London have increased from £245,000 to £532,000 over the same period. (Source: Land registry). “The current state of IHT places a substantial financial strain on the loved ones left behind after a person’s passing. In response, individuals are increasingly resorting to measures such as gifting, investing, donating, and insuring their money to minimise or avoid this tax. “Failing to promptly and effectively address the issue of IHT can lead to families facing overwhelming administrative and financial burdens during a time of already profound emotional stress. By adopting a proactive and incremental approach to IHT, the process can be made significantly easier, alleviating the strain on those who are grieving the loss of a loved one.” Here’s a handy chart from today’s April public finances, showing UK public sector borrowing as a proportion of GDP. As you can see, the Covid-19 pandemic pushed up borrowing in the 2020-21 financial year to 15%, the highest for 75 years. Shares in Pennon Group, which owns South West Water, have dropped over 2.5% this morning after regulators launched an enforcement probe into water leakage. Pennon told shareholders that Ofwat have announced an investigation into South West Water’s 2021/22 operational performance data relating to leakage and per capita consumption. Pennon says: This operational performance data was reported in South West Water’s Annual Performance Report 2021/22. This report is subject to rigorous assurance processes which include independent checks and balances carried out by external technical auditor. We will work openly and constructively with Ofwat to comply with the formal notice issued to South West Water as part of this investigation. Pennon shares are down 2.75% at 799.5p, trading at their lowest since the start of March, among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies. My colleague Nils Pratley has written about how the water industry is trying to avoid being held fully to account for the failures to invest properly over recent decades. Here’s a flavour: We want to be held to account …” said Ruth Kelly, the new public face of the English water companies, last week, briefly raising hopes of a moment of reckoning for the industry’s past (and current) sewage spills. Then the chair of Water UK clarified what her version of accountability covers. The companies wish to be held to account “… for putting it right”. The past 30 years, we were invited to think, should be considered an unfortunate chapter in which the industry, terribly unfortunately, didn’t give sewage spills enough attention while other investments were prioritised. That was the gist of her apology. “By and large, the water companies were carrying out their legal responsibilities but … what’s legal is not necessarily the right answer or what people expect,” she argued on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. One trusts this “by and large” claim provoked spluttering among officials at the Environment Agency and Ofwat. As Kelly must know, both regulatory bodies have been engaged for the past 18 months in an inquiry to determine whether the industry was, in essence, not treating as much sewage as it should have been at 2,000-plus treatment plants. Whether legal duties were met is very much a live question…. April’s public finances figures have got the new fiscal year off to “a shaky start”, say Capital Economics. After one month of the 2023/24 fiscal year, the Chancellor is already on track to overshoot the OBR’s full-year borrowing forecast of £132bn (5.1% of GDP) by about £3.2bn, says Ruth Gregory, their deputy chief UK economist. Gregory explains: Revisions to past data meant that public sector net borrowing in the 2022/23 financial year was revised down from £139.2bn (5.5% of GDP) to £137.1bn (5.4% of GDP). But the government borrowed more than expected in April. Borrowing was £25.6bn in April, bigger than the OBR forecast and consensus forecast of £22.4bn and £11.9bn above last April’s outturn. Given the recent resilience in the economy, weaker-than-expected receipts was a little surprising. At £69.7bn, total receipts were well below the £72.2bn the OBR forecast. A fair chunk of the overshoot also reflected higher total expenditure of £89.2bn (OBR forecast £83.5bn) as recent rises in RPI inflation (to which index-linked gilts are pegged) caused debt interest payments of £9.8bn, the highest April figure since records began in 1997 (the cost of energy support schemes was in line the OBR forecast). But, Capital Economics doubts this will prevent the Chancellor from embarking on a fiscal splurge ahead of the next election. Today’s public finances data shows that the UK national debt was almost as large as the country’s annual economic output. Public sector net debt at the end of April 2023 was £2,536.9bn or around 99.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). The current debt-to-GDP ratio is at levels last seen in the early 1960s. French billionaire Patrick Drahi has increased his stake in BT to more than 24%, but re-iterated that he does not intend to make a bid for the £15bn British telecoms giant. Drahi, who controls an 18% stake through subsidiary Altice UK, raised his position to 24.5% on Tuesday, my colleague Mark Sweney writes. The move comes days after BT announced a major restructuring to become a “leaner businesss” that will see workforce cut by as much as 55,000 by 2030. The cuts will come from a combination of natural attrition, cutting contractors at the end of the build phase rolling out fibre broadband and 5G mobile networks nationwide, and a move into AI which could replace about 10,000 jobs. The company said: “Altice UK has restated its position to the board of BT that it does not intend to make an offer for BT.” Drahi’s investment vehicle first bought a 12 per cent stake in BT in June 2021, increasing it to 18 per cent later that year. The UK government moved to examine Drahi’s stake under new tougher new powers to potential block the takeover of key national assets under the National Security &amp; Investments Act. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, tells us: Last week BT’s earnings sent shares sharply lower. Clearly Altice UK judged that now is an opportune moment to acquire further shares at an attractive price with the stock down several percent since last week. In June 2021, billionaire Drahi paid around £2.2 billion for a 12.1% stake in BT. In December that year, his company Altice UK raised the holding to 18% at a price tag of roughly another £1 billion. Last year the UK government gave the green light to Drahi’s stake building, ruling that it didn’t pose a national security threat. BT’s results last week highlighted the pressures facing the business with falling free cash flow and plans to slash 55,000 jobs. It has been dealing with costs pressures from inflation and energy bills as well as capital expenditure on its national fibre network rollout. Altice UK’s stake building provides a vote of confidence in BT but there are questions about what changes Drahi may want to implement to the business. Perhaps he could push for more aggressive cost cuts at BT. Grocery price inflation has fallen for the second month in a row – but is still adding an extra £833 to the average consumer’s annual bill, according to latest figures. Prices over the four weeks to May 14 were 17.2% higher than a year ago, down from April’s 17.3%, data firm Kantar reports this morning. Kantar points out that price rises are still incredibly high – 17.2% is the third fastest rate of grocery inflation reported since 2008. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar’s Worldpanel Division, explains: This could add an extra £833 to the average household’s annual grocery bill if consumers don’t shop in different ways Kantar also reports that the average cost of four pints of milk has come down by 8p since last month, but is still 30p higher than this time last year at £1.60. Several supermarket chains have trumpeted price cuts for milk recently. Kantar also reports that more consumers are turning to supermarket own-brand products in a bid to keep their bills under control. Sales of the cheapest own-label products soared by 15.2% over the past month, almost double the 8.3% increase seen for branded products. Although borrowing jumped in April, the UK actually borrowed less than previously thought in the previous financial year. The ONS revised down its estimate for the budget deficit in the 2022/23 financial year that ended in March to £137.1bn, down from £139.2bn previously. On this morning’s jump in UK borrowing, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt says: “It is right we borrowed billions to protect families and businesses against the impacts of the pandemic and Putin’s energy crisis. “But debt and borrowing remain too high now – which is why it’s one of our priorities to get debt falling. “We’ve taken difficult but necessary decisions to balance the nation’s books, and if we stick to our plan and get our economy growing, then debt is set to fall.” John Allan says he regrets having to step down early at Barratt. In a statement reported by PA Media, Allan said: “It is with regret that at the request of the board I am stepping down as chairman of Barratt Developments Plc as of June 30 2023, ahead of finishing my tenure in early September as planned. “My early departure from Barratt is a result of the anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations made against me, as reported in the Guardian which I vehemently deny.” Outgoing Tesco chairman John Allan is stepping down from his role chairing housebuilder Barratt Developments earlier than planned, at the request of the board. Barratt told the City this morning that Allan will step down as Chair of the Board and as a Director of the Company from 30 June 2023. Allan had been expected to step down in September, to be replaced by non-executive director Caroline Silver, but this plan – announced in January – has been brought forward. Barratt told shareholders that they had decided to speed up the transition to prevent allegations made against Allan from becoming disruptive to the company, saying: At the request of the Board, John Allan will step down as Chair of the Board and as a Director of the Company on 30 June 2023. The Board believes it is in the best interests of Barratt to accelerate the planned transition to the new Chair of the Board to prevent the ongoing impact of the allegations against John from becoming disruptive to the Company. Barratt added that it has not received any complaints about John Allan during his tenure at the company, which he joined in 2014. Last Friday, Tesco announced that Allan would step down in June, after the Guardian reported that Allan allegedly touched the bottom of a senior member of Tesco staff in June 2022, at the company’s last AGM. Four allegations about Allan emerged during the Guardian’s investigation into the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) – the UK’s foremost business lobbying group. Allan was president of the organisation between 2018 and 2020 and then vice-president until October 2021. He has denied three of the four claims made against him. He has admitted making a comment about a CBI staffer’s appearance that she found to be offensive in 2019, and apologised for the remark. Barratt senior independent director, Jock Lennox, says: “The Board is grateful to John for his nine years of service to Barratt. He leaves the Company in a strong financial and operational position, continuing to perform well in challenging market conditions.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain borrowed more than £25bn to balance the books last month, the second-highest borrowing for an April ever, and more than expected. Soaring inflation and the cost of capping energy bills drove up borrowing again, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Borrowing hit £25.6bn last month, which is £11.9bn higher than in April 2022, and the second highest since monthly records began in 1993 (behind April 2020, when the pandemic hit the economy). Economists polled by Reuters had predicted that public sector net borrowing, excluding the impact of state-owned bank, would have hit £19.75bn in April. Although public sector receipts rose by £900m in April compared with March, that was dwarfed by a £12.8bn rise in public sector spending. High inflation continued to drive up the cost of the national debt, as many government bonds are pegged to the rising cost of living. The interest payable on central government debt jumped to £9.8bn in April, a jump of £3.1bn compared with April 2022. Thas was due to the increase in the RPI measure of inflation. The ONS explains: Rises in the Retail Prices Index have increased the interest payable on index-linked gilts. This represents the third-highest interest payable in any month on record, behind the £20.0bn in June 2022 and the £18.0bn in December 2022. The UK’s energy support packages meant central government spent £3.9bn on subsidies, £1.8bn more than in the April 2022. Most of that increase was due to the cost of the Energy Price Guarantee for households and the Energy Bills Discount Scheme. Also coming up today The UK economy, and its policymakers, are in the spotlight today. A team from the International Monetary Fund are in London to give their annual healthcheck on Britain’s economy. The IMF will give its verdict after meetings with the Bank of England, the Treasury, independent watchdogs at the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Financial Conduct Authority. Last month the IMF forecast that UK GDP would shrink by 0.3% this year, the weakest of all major industrialised countries. But chancellor Jeremy Hunt has vowed to beat these forecasts, and earlier this month the Bank of England upgraded its own estimates due to a brightening economic outlook. Hunt, and IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva, will hold a press conference to discuss the report this morning, from 11.15am. MPs on the Treasury Committee will quiz top officials from the Bank of England this morning too. The Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, chief economist Huw Pill, and Monetary Policy Committee members Catherine Mann and Silvana Tenreyro will be questioned about this month’s interest rate rise to 4.5%, the highest since 2008. Huw Pill’s recent comment that British households and businesses “need to accept” they are poorer may come up too….

But unlike Inside Out and Soul’s pint-sized explainers of the psyche, there’s virtually no philosophical sprinkling on the cupcake here. Not that that will stop the young ’uns from gobbling it up anyway – but they might have enjoyed something more nutritious. The exam to become a fully accredited tooth fairy seems easy enough. As the would-be disco earworm at the start of My Fairy Troublemaker has it, “Sneak inside, take the tooth, make the toy, and disappear!” Cookie-scoffing, misbehaving Violetta (voiced by Jella Haase) is the only apprentice who fails to make the grade, unlike her swotty mate Yolando (Julian Mau). Stuck in her belief that she’s really “the most special tooth fairy ever”, she steals a gem that allows her access to the human world. But in hijacking Yolando’s assignment to obtain an incisor from city kid Sami (John Chadwick), she finds an ally in his older stepsister Maxie (Lisa-Marie Koroll) when she is trapped in our reality. Starting with a pretty annoying hero in Violetta, director Caroline Origer sets the bar low in terms of engaging the audience. Both Maxie, uncomfortable in her new family, and Violetta, in danger of turning into a flower the longer she is exiled, are outsiders. But the film is more confident reverting to babyish antics – Violetta’s chocolate fixation, Sami’s itching powder stunts – than anything emotional. Neither is the larger ecological theme tabled with any subtlety: nefarious developer Rick (Tim Grobe), who wants to demolish an urban greenhouse containing a tree holding the key to Violetta’s return, literally has a dollar-sign belt buckle. Luckily, the animation has the finesse the story doesn’t; competition for Pixar’s rhythm and texture on presumably a fraction of the budget. The elderly chief fairy’s silvery mane of dandelion seeds is a very nice touch. More delicacy and detail like that would have helped. • My Fairy Troublemaker is released in UK cinemas on 26 May, and available on digital platforms in Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2023/may/23/blood-of-the-virgin-by-sammy-harkham-review-to-live-and-cry-in-la","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"Blood of the Virgin by Sammy Harkham review – to live and cry in LA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/23/blood-of-the-virgin-by-sammy-harkham-review-to-live-and-cry-in-la","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/23/blood-of-the-virgin-by-sammy-harkham-review-to-live-and-cry-in-la","fields":{"headline":"Blood of the Virgin by Sammy Harkham review – to live and cry in LA","bodyText":"I mean it as a compliment when I say that Sammy Harkham’s Blood of the Virgin is a very nerdy kind of comic; if you’re a fan of cartoonists such as Joe Matt or Seth, and their intense feeling for lonely, hapless men, you’ll find plenty to enjoy here. Like some of their work, superficially it’s a nostalgic beast, one set mostly in the Los Angeles film industry. It’s 1971, the year of Dirty Harry, Diamonds Are Forever and The French Connection, though you’d never know it: in Harkham’s universe, the Hollywood sign is far, far away. But there’s a lot going on here besides. Its hero, Seymour, is a 27-year-old movie editor at an exploitation film company who also happens to be a Jewish Iraqi immigrant. If the book is about one man’s struggle to become an artist in a city that cares nothing for losers, it’s also about the Jewish experience in the period when thousands of Holocaust survivors were still around to tell their stories. It is, in other words, as much about inherited guilt as it is about rank ambition. Seymour, self-absorbed and chaotic, spends his days in the dark, splicing together the terrible B-movies churned out by his toad-like boss, Val. His days are long, and at the end of them, he goes home to a small baby, his first child, who’s apt to let neither one of his parents get any sleep. In the small rented house he shares with his wife, tension is sky-high, and not only because of Junior. Ida feels neglected by her husband, and as an Ashkenazi (her family’s roots are Hungarian), she ’s treated like an alien by Seymour’s relatives. Half the time, they refuse even to believe she is Jewish. While the couple dote on their son – “Put him between two slices of bread and eat him all up!” says Ida, when Seymour admits he could squeeze him half to death – they kvetch constantly, and eventually, Ida disappears to New Zealand to be with her silent, damaged parents. But perhaps it’s as well she’s away. Seymour is about to plunge head-first into a prolonged state of crisis. First, Val buys one of his scripts, Blood of the Virgin. Then he fires the movie’s director, at which point Seymour gets the chance to replace him. What follows is in some ways predictable: a tale of too-small budgets, wooden actors and constant interference from above (naturally, Harkham gives us a preview of part of the film in full colour, one of several stories within his story). What’s less predictable is Seymour’s response to it all. Is all this what he has longed for? Sometimes, he wonders. If Harkham’s portrayal of LA’s seedy, grindhouse scene is pitch-perfect – here are the parties and the valet parking, the cheapskate shortcuts and the abuse – it’s his Sephardic protagonist we see the more clearly: an outsider whose roots ground him and ensure he is the eternal stranger. Already praised by the great Art Spiegelman (Maus), this singular book has taken 14 years to complete – it appeared first in instalments, in Harkham’s own comic book series, Crickets – and it’s not hard to see why. With its flashbacks both to the Holocaust and to pre-Saddam Iraq, its scope is panoramic, even as its narrative is mostly (almost obsessively) focused on a world that is not only seamy, but also intensely parochial. I don’t know if Blood of the Virgin is, as some are saying, a masterpiece; it is a massive book in every way, and I’m still settling it in my mind.

One, because I thought he would, and should, play a few more years. He was still in game shape and could bring a veteran scoring presence to any team in the NBA. The second reason is because I am in the middle of the most consequential separation of my adult life with the woman I still consider my soul mate. Like with Anthony, or Melo, as he is known affectionately by his fans, there was no obvious inciting incident. Melo and the game seemed to drift apart and neither could give the other what they wanted. The same can be said for my former partner and me. The video he released showcasing his amazing journey from the gang-infested streets of Baltimore, to the mountaintop of Syracuse, to becoming the ninth leading scorer in NBA history broke me. I had yet to cry for the ending of my relationship, but Monday’s news brought it my grief to the fore: one of our favorite rituals was watching the NBA and cheering for the Knicks together. She was not a Knicks fan before we met. Our first date was watching the 2016 NBA finals at Hooters. Watching her cheer for LeBron James and the underdog Cleveland Cavaliers in the basking glow of a 100 televisions and over a pitcher of Miller Lite was the moment I fell in love with her. When we spoke for the first time on Monday morning, it was to discuss where I would be moving. I asked her if she would help me find an apartment, as she was so much better than me at finding a deal. As the tears welled in my eyes, I apologized and told her that I was trying to be strong but that my favorite player was retiring, pushing me past my breaking point. The first year we dated, Melo was still on the team, surrounded by players far inferior to him and under the misguided “leadership” of Phil Jackson, who disgraced Melo at every turn. Knowing how much both of them meant to me, she gifted me a loving and empathetic “I’m sorry.” My partner was there when Melo was traded from the Knicks to Oklahoma City. We watched his abrupt outing from there after just a season, then again, a failed fit in Houston. We cheered together for his resurgence in Portland. And then hoped he would finally win it all with his buddy LeBron in Los Angeles. There’s no hidden irony in Melo’s career ending the same day as our relationship. Like Melo, it had been fading for some time. The acknowledgment that neither Melo nor I would experience the intimacy of winning was an unspoken understanding. That Melo never won it all in the NBA was one of the reasons I defended him with such vigor. I have always loved an underdog story, and Melo’s was one of the best. The former Knicks forward and future Hall of Famer – who last played with the Lakers in the 2021 season – is finally retiring at 38 after 19 NBA seasons. I kept a signed copy of his book, Where Tomorrows Aren’t Promised, by my bedside. For those who have escaped poverty and are learning how to be, it was my Bible. Melo’s martial mistakes, chasing the bag, and “love him or hate him” persona resonated with me, perhaps too deeply. Knicks fans have a mantra, “One a Knick, always a Knick.” With Melo, it was more than that. He was the one player I would always go to war for. Even though he would never know I existed, it was enough I knew he did. I saw so much of my failures in him, magnified with millions and a platform. He was a player who never won it all and will be remembered on equal measure for his failings. In that, too, I relate. I might not have married the girl of my dreams, but I take solace in knowing I’m not the only one. Melo entered the NBA at the height of the one-man isolation circus. His off-the-dribble skill set fit perfectly in a league with Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Vince Carter, and Kobe Bryant as the face. But as the league evolved and superteams were formed in Boston, Miami, and Los Angeles, Melo chose the road alone, choosing the bag over free agency and teaming up with his 2003 draft class buddies, James and Dwyane Wade, in Miami. As the league continued to change, it left Melo behind. No longer were teams looking for the next great gunner, but instead, those who could plug and play within a team identity. No longer could you be the first option as a scorer. You had to play defense and make your teammates better. Those were two skills Melo never prioritized. His game had been enough. And why not? He had experienced winning the NCAA championship as a freshman at Syracuse while making the playoffs all eight seasons with the Denver Nuggets, who drafted him third overall. Like Melo, I, too, suffered from main-character syndrome. Growing up without any control over your circumstances, unable to escape trauma, poverty and environmental violence, can breed that kind of ego-centric mindset. As an adult, I willed my existence to serve my needs, giving me the power I never had as a child. It caused me to be selfish and bend the world around me to my needs. This type of thinking can whisk everyone around you into a chaotic frenzy. For Melo, it created four teammates standing idly by while he unleashed one of the greatest bags of offensive tricks ever seen. For me, it created two different relationships, one for each of our point-of-views. Ultimately, we went from a team to separate people, and nobody won. But Melo’s seemingly unbreakable charm, the almost angelic naivety that his way would always win, was my favorite attribute of his. It’s the one trait I made for myself. It could be called arrogance or gall. It could create heroes or brutes. These binary perceptions embody the two drastically different responses to Melo’s legacy, as they reflect the differing points of view when a relationship dissolves. As a Knicks fan who started watching in 2002, I have only known pain. So for me, Melo arrived in New York as an epiphany. An All-Star 10 times, seven of his selections, including the NBA’s scoring title in 2013, were in a Knicks jersey from 2011 through 2017, the prime of his career. As a Knick, Melo provided my only glimpse of success in two decades, averaging 24.7 points, seven rebounds, and 2.3 assists while making the All-Star team every season. Only eight other players have walked onto an NBA floor and scored more points than Melo. Only eight. This, as well as his three Olympic gold medals with Team USA, are just two of the reasons he was voted on the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team by his peers. Another reason is he never ran from the smoke. He took on every challenge by himself, for better or worse. Melo will be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when his time comes. But that won’t make up for how current coaches and executives have chosen to keep him out of the league. No one has stuck up for him, allowing him to go all season without a call, forcing him into a retirement outside of his own terms. There was no farewell tour or magic moment at the Garden. There was just a letter to those he loved that he was done. Melo was always the same, on and off the court. He never ran from the media, carrying a team, questions about his intentions, or difficult matchups. And like most of our lives, it didn’t turn out how he wanted. When I watched Melo on the court, I watched more than a player, but a fully realized person, flaws and all. Melo isn’t my favorite player just because of how good he was. He is my favorite player because he is the most relatable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2023/may/23/uk-food-price-inflation-shoppers-kantar","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T07:55:24Z","webTitle":"UK food price inflation at third-highest level since 2008","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/23/uk-food-price-inflation-shoppers-kantar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/23/uk-food-price-inflation-shoppers-kantar","fields":{"headline":"UK food price inflation at third-highest level since 2008","bodyText":"UK food price inflation remains at the third-highest level since the financial crisis, with the annual rate at which the cost of groceries is increasing at the elevated level of 17.2%, retail industry data shows. Prices barely eased during the four weeks to 14 May to only marginally below April’s 17.3% figure, according to the latest release from the analytics firm Kantar, representing the third-highest rate of grocery inflation since 2008. Even though the average cost of four pints of milk has come down by 8p since last month, it remains 30p higher than it was this time last year at £1.60. Stubbornly high food and drink prices have added an extra £833 a year to shoppers’ bills, Kantar found, unless consumers make changes to their usual habits to try to cut the cost. More consumers are turning to supermarket own-brand products, a trend also reported in April, in an attempt to keep their bills under control. Sales of the cheapest own-label products soared by 15.2% over the past month, almost double the 8.3% increase for branded products. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “The drop in grocery price inflation, which is down by 0.1 percentage points on last month’s figure, is without doubt welcome news for shoppers – but it is still incredibly high.” Shoppers flocked to the discount supermarkets, Aldi and Lidl, as they sought bargains. Aldi became the fastest-growing grocer over the past month as its sales increased by 24%, while sales at Lidl rose by 23.2%. However, Waitrose benefited from shoppers splashing out on extra treats before the coronation of King Charles. Its sales grew by 4.8%, the highest growth rate it has experienced for more than two years. Despite the pressure on household budgets, consumers spent an extra £218m on groceries during the week of the coronation, when there was a rise in sales of wine and quiche. Sales of sparkling wine shot up by 129%, and of still wine by 33%, as shoppers planned to raise a glass over the long weekend. “Lots of people seem to have got into the spirit of the royal occasion, grabbing their chance to have a go at the official coronation quiche recipe,” McKevitt said. “Sales of ingredients like chilled pastry surged by 89%, while fresh cream sales jumped by 80% and frozen broad beans by 57%.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/queensland-changes-laws-to-accommodate-un-prisons-inspectors","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T07:27:13Z","webTitle":"Queensland changes laws to accommodate UN prisons inspectors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/queensland-changes-laws-to-accommodate-un-prisons-inspectors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/queensland-changes-laws-to-accommodate-un-prisons-inspectors","fields":{"headline":"Queensland changes laws to accommodate UN prisons inspectors","bodyText":"The Queensland government has passed a bill to remove legislative barriers that prohibited UN officials from visiting places of detention during their visit to Australia last year. A UN anti-torture subcommittee suspended its tour of Australian detention facilities in October after Guardian Australia revealed Queensland refused access to some mental health facilities that hold people charged with crimes, while New South Wales blocked inspectors from entering all of its detention facilities. States and territory governments had known for five years that the inspections would occur and some had changed laws in advance to provide for access. The delegation’s head, Aisha Shujune Muhammad, criticised Queensland and NSW at the time for restricting UN officials’ access, citing a “lack of cooperation” and “limited understanding” by the states. The legislation passed without opposition on Tuesday. Queensland’s newly reappointed attorney general, Yvette D’Ath, said the bill furthers the government’s commitment “to upholding the humane treatment of people in detention”. D’Ath said access to the facilities had been limited to preserve people’s “safety and privacy” but the subcommittee was offered the opportunity to interview staff offsite and request information before their arrival. During debate of the bill earlier this month, the police minister, Mark Ryan, said the commonwealth government ratified the optional protocol to the convention against torture (Opcat) in 2017 “with very limited consultation with states and territories”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said Queensland authorities will retain the right “to temporarily prohibit or restrict the United Nations subcommittee’s delegations access to certain parts of the facility in certain circumstances”. An objection must be made on grounds of national defence, public safety, natural disaster or serious disorder in the place of detention, according to the bill’s explanatory notes. “This is to maintain security and good order or to conduct essential operations at those facilities,” Ryan said. Shadow assistant minister for justice, Laura Gerber, said the LNP supported the bill but criticised the delay of its passage. “The UN had to cancel their trip to Australia, putting us on par with Rwanda, because the state government could not get their act together,” she said during the debate. Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, was absent during the debate after testing positive to Covid-19 but expressed his support for the bill on his website. He did, however, question whether the new laws had really been required to grant access to UN inspectors. “I’m not convinced that this bill is more than political cover for the damage that decision did to the Queensland government’s reputation and this country’s reputation on human rights internationally,” he said in a statement. “The Government never explained to us exactly what ‘legislative barriers’ prohibited the subcommittee’s physical access to mental health and Forensic Disability Service facilities. “There is nothing in this bill that would prevent access being refused in a very similar manner on the subcommittee’s next visit; in fact it’s conceivable that access could be refused at even more facilities because of how broadly this is drafted.” Berkman said the bill should only restrict access by reference to the Opcat provisions, as was done by the ACT and Tasmania’s equivalent legislation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/australian-medias-racism-reckoning-indigenous-journalist-quits-over-unrelenting-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T07:20:29Z","webTitle":"Australian media’s racism reckoning: Indigenous journalist quits over ‘unrelenting’ abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/australian-medias-racism-reckoning-indigenous-journalist-quits-over-unrelenting-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/australian-medias-racism-reckoning-indigenous-journalist-quits-over-unrelenting-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Australian media’s racism reckoning: Indigenous journalist quits over ‘unrelenting’ abuse","bodyText":"It was a moment of reckoning. Stan Grant, one of Australia’s most prominent Indigenous journalists, stared down the barrel of a live camera, stony-faced and red-eyed, to explain why he was stepping away from his role hosting a flagship program at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It had been a little over two weeks since Grant, a Wiradjuri man, spoke about the impact of colonisation on Indigenous Australians during the ABC’s coverage of King Charles’s coronation. The comments prompted a torrent of vitriol, much of it energised by repeated criticisms in Rupert Murdoch’s Australian outlets. The inevitable racist abuse on social media that fell upon Grant and his family has been described as “grotesque” and “unrelenting”. It led Grant to announce his intention to step back from writing for ABC’s website and hosting its live discussion show, Q+A. It has also sparked renewed discussion in Australia about enduring racism, pernicious media influence, and accusations about the institutional timidity of Australia’s public broadcaster in defending its Indigenous staff. When Grant hosted the show for the last time on Monday night, he bared his soul to the half a million watching. He was not leaving because of racist abuse that he had received, but because, as part of the media, he felt he was “part of the problem”. “I’m not walking away for a while because of racism,” Grant said. “We get that far too often. I’m not walking away because of social media hatred. “I need a break from the media. I feel like I’m part of the problem. And I need to ask myself how, or if, we can do it better. “We in the media must ask if we are truly honouring a world worth living in. Too often, we are the poison in the bloodstream of our society. I fear the media does not have the love or the language to speak to the gentle spirits of our land.” A critical choice for Australia Grant’s hard truths come at a pivotal time in Australia’s history. The nation, which has long struggled to comprehend the evils done to First Nations peoples, is debating a change the constitution which would enshrine a new advisory body giving voice to Indigenous Australians on matters that affect them. The proposal, known as the voice, would act as an independent and permanent advisory body to Australia’s parliament and government on matters that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Australians are expected to go to the polls in late 2023 to vote in a referendum on whether the constitution should be altered to establish such a body. The debate has already become caustic. The conservative opposition has opted to oppose the voice, lamenting a lack of detail and what it claims would be the constitutional division of Australians on racial grounds. Opposition leader Peter Dutton went as far as claiming the referendum would wind back progress of the civil rights movement, represented “a symptom of the madness of identity politics”, and claimed it would “re-racialise our nation”. On Monday, just hours before Grant’s live address, Australia’s minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, gave a withering response. She accused Dutton of spreading “misinformation and scare campaigns” about the Indigenous voice. “We have just heard, in one speech, every bit of disinformation and misinformation and scare campaigns that exist in this debate,” she said. Grant on Monday offered a glimpse into the personal toll the recent media and social media barrage has taken on him. The broadcaster said he had seen the media “lie and distort my words” since the coronation, attempting to depict him as “hate-filled” and guilty of “maligning Australia”. He said he and his family had been directly targeted and threatened, his wife mocked for being married to a Wiradjuri man. “To those who have abused me and my family. I would just say if your aim was to hurt me, well you’ve succeeded, and I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m sorry that I must have given you so much cause to hate me so much, to target me and my family and to make threats against me. I’m sorry. “Sometimes we need to just take time out. Sometimes our souls are hurting and so it is for me. I’ve had to learn that endurance is not always strength. Sometimes strength is knowing when to say stop.” Denis Muller, a senior research fellow with the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Advancing Journalism, says Grant’s treatment is a “case study in how content on the professional mass media can fuel social media toxicity”. Grant did not accuse the mass media outlets directly of racism. He did not need to, according to Muller. “The professional mass media’s contribution to the racism he writes about is more subtle,” Muller wrote for The Conversation. “It is to be found, first, in the singling out of Grant from the other members of the ABC panel whose discussion as part of the ABC’s coronation coverage has led to the outrage driving Grant away.” “The professional mass media well understands the effects its work can have – for good or ill – on those engaged on social media. But it fails to give sufficient weight to this when making judgments about the portrayal of people who are vulnerable to being trolled: women, people of colour, ethnic and religious minorities.” ‘I am down right now. But I will get back up’ On the morning of Grant’s last appearance on Q+A, ABC staff rallied in support across the country. They carried signs that read “I stand with Stan” and “We reject racism”. The ABC’s head of news Justin Stevens spoke to the crowd of hundreds gathered outside the organisation’s headquarters in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo. He said it was time to draw a line in the sand. “The line in the sand is here, and we will not tolerate our staff being subjected to racial abuse, or any form of abuse. It must stop,” he said. “I would say, other sections of the media that play a part in facilitating, encouraging, or drawing attention to this … need to take a really good hard look at themselves and the role they play.” But ABC management have themselves faced criticism for taking too long to come to Grant’s aid. The line in the sand, critics say, should have been made clear long ago. Grant himself took aim at ABC management in the column first announcing his decision. “I am writing this because no one at the ABC – whose producers invited me on to their coronation coverage as a guest – has uttered one word of public support,” he said. It’s a problem that some believe has its roots in the lack of media diversity at the ABC and many of the nation’s media outlets. Osman Faruqi, a journalist who once worked at the ABC, wrote a scathing piece saying the public broadcaster’s failure to protect Grant reflected a “depressingly common trend non-white ABC staff have experienced for years”. “It might not be obvious to the average audience member, but there is a stark difference in how the ABC publicly defends some of its journalists compared to others, and this difference regularly cleaves on racial lines,” he wrote. Stevens, the ABC’s news chief, says he regrets not defending Grant earlier. He also took aim at News Corp Australia for its relentless campaign against the public broadcaster. Stevens accused News Corp of targeting the ABC because it was “trying to chip away [at] people’s sense of trust in what we do because we threaten their business model”. Despite the ABC’s delayed decision to rally to his cause, Grant has left the door open to returning. His message on Monday was delivered with an air of grace and optimism, despite all he has endured in recent weeks. “Sometimes we need to just take time out. Sometimes our souls are hurting and so it is for me. I’ve had to learn that endurance is not always strength. Sometimes strength is knowing when to say stop,” he said. “I am down right now, I am. But I will get back up. And you can come at me again, and I will meet you with the love of my people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2023/may/23/perhaps-one-day-this-whole-age-of-football-will-require-an-asterisk-manchester-city-premier-league-title","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Perhaps one day this whole age of football will require an asterisk | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/23/perhaps-one-day-this-whole-age-of-football-will-require-an-asterisk-manchester-city-premier-league-title","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2023/may/23/perhaps-one-day-this-whole-age-of-football-will-require-an-asterisk-manchester-city-premier-league-title","fields":{"headline":"Perhaps one day this whole age of football will require an asterisk","bodyText":"In 2008 Speedo introduced the LZR Racer, a body-length swimsuit lined with stiff polyurethane plastic panels that dramatically reduced drag in the water. Essentially it turned the swimmer into a smooth aerodynamic tube, trapping little pockets of air to improve buoyancy. The technology was introduced in time for the Beijing Olympics, where 23 world records were set by swimmers wearing the LZR. The impact on the sport was cataclysmic. Athletes who enjoyed the benefits of the new “super suit” described the sensation as like flying. Those who had signed deals with other manufacturers were faced with the choice of breaking their contracts or seeing their careers ruined. And, of course, the records continued to tumble. After Michael Phelps – wearing the LZR – was beaten at the 2009 world championships by the unknown Paul Biederman, wearing a successor suit made entirely of polyurethane – his coach Bob Bowman threatened to pull him out of swimming entirely. In the space of 17 months in 2008 and 2009, a total of 140 world records were set using the LZR. Fifteen still stand. As Bowman put it at the time: “We’ve lost all the history of the sport.” For some within swimming, the super-suit era remains something of a taboo these days, an embarrassing family secret, a period in the sport’s history that many would prefer to be consigned to oblivion. Yet some also idly wonder what swimming might have looked like had Fina (now World Aquatics) not chosen to ban plastic-based swimsuits, as it did in 2010. What might have happened if an entire sport had basically chosen to legitimise the pursuit of a grotesque advantage through whatever means possible? Perhaps, on reflection, it might have ended up looking a lot like football. “Lance Armstrong” started trending on Twitter for a while on Thursday morning, in the aftermath of Manchester City’s stunning Champions League triumph against Real Madrid. Which, while funny, doesn’t really work as a comparison for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is that City are yet to be found guilty of the 115 Premier League rule breaches of which they are accused, a process that should finally reach its conclusion some time towards the end of the Anthropocene, once City have finally run out of objections over the composition of the hearing panel, the temperature and furniture arrangement of the adjudication room, the colour of the flowers, and so on. But even then the Armstrong parallel feels wilfully obtuse. Pumping your body full of EPO and human growth hormone in a sport where the correlation between power output and success is almost a straight line is not really the same thing as false accounting in a complex ball sport. By the same token, everyone agrees that doping should be banned. Not everyone agrees that football club owners should be restricted in the amount they are allowed to spend. The more compelling analogy, for me, is with swimming’s super-suit era: a period of high drama but also high farce, and crucially defined not by a single high-profile case but a whole culture of lawless free‑for‑all, much of it residing in the endless grey area between what is legal and what is not. Because this is the slightly inconvenient part for those seeking to make a grisly exemplar of City: this is a sport where everyone is essentially trying to cheat all the time. Deceit and duplicity and bad intentions are built into virtually every facet of football, running through it like turds in a river. There’s the small stuff, like diving and time-wasting and trying to claim a corner you know you didn’t win. There’s the medium‑sized stuff, like tapping-up, or trying to get referees changed. And then there is the elite-tier cheating where you try to pervert the very fundamentals of the game itself, either by distorting the competitive ecosystem through obscene wealth or rounding up your mates and deciding to start a fancy new Super League. It’s a sliding scale, to be sure. But to a greater or lesser extent, everyone is engaged in it. The important point is that the physical existence of actual rules is to a large extent irrelevant. Football’s regulatory framework has never been remotely fit for purpose, which is one of the reasons a strong independent regulator is so urgently required. The key issue here is one of trust: the extent to which we as fans can trust what we’re watching. Barcelona and Real Madrid during the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo eras were funded by hundreds of millions in illegal state subsidies, mainly tax breaks and soft loans. The money that bankrolled Juventus’s era of dominance was seemingly conjured out of thin air, based on false player values. The regimes that fund City, Newcastle, Paris Saint‑Germain and perhaps Manchester United next are autocracies who believe less in the rule of law than the rule of getting whatever they want. Perhaps one day, like the super-suit world records, this whole age of football will require an asterisk. This title was won by manipulating referees. This Champions League was won by spending money you said didn’t exist. This Ballon d’Or belongs to a player whose club shouldn’t have been able to afford him. Perhaps one day we will look back on the reckless carbon era of football with a certain sense of shame, a weird experiment never to be repeated. For now, we continue to glide bewitchingly through our frictionless, padded, polyurethane-enhanced present."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/23/clothes-life-death-succession-grieving-pregnant-shiv-roy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Who says clothes aren’t a matter of life or death?

In Succession they’re both","bodyText":"In the days after my mother’s death, I spent a lot of time online looking for shoes to wear to her funeral. Not an obvious reaction to grief. But while I had a dress – a black one with pretty red peonies that I kept rolled up in my bag when her illness began to accelerate during the summer – we were in lockdown so the shops were shut, and I wasn’t going to wear Birkenstocks. Eventually, I found some brogues on eBay and, after wiping them with Dettol, tried everything on. I looked nice, put together. But this was the problem. Looking “put together” seemed like the wrong response when I felt anything but. On the day of her funeral, I wore my mother’s navy skirt suit. It was too big and I was too hot, but for both reasons felt much more appropriate. I was reminded of all this after watching Shiv Roy walking behind her father’s coffin in the most recent episode of Succession. Even in deep grief, she was forced to look the part: powdered nose, hair done, a black pantsuit with a Disney villain neckline and a string of establishment pearls. In short, a scion and a firebrand – not a grieving mother-to-be. Death is a great leveller until it isn’t. Succession is not a show couched in realism, however tangible the sibling dynamics often feel. It’s a show about appearances, and within that, clothes. No one eats, shops or – despite the pregnancy – seems to have sex. The only constant is what these awful people wear, which remains largely unchanged throughout all four seasons. Except for Shiv, who, as the only daughter of an unfathomably rich and powerful rightwinger, is under more scrutiny than most. In the first series, she was a long-haired power liberal in Fair Isle knits from H&amp;M (H&amp;M!) and dresses from Ted Baker. Now she is in buttoned-up Max Mara waistcoats and Ralph Lauren houndstooth jackets, betraying herself as a woman not in control, but trapped in a doom loop of familial discontent, lies and daddy issues. The main change of course is that she’s pregnant, a fact that she has been trying to hide until now. As someone who is also pregnant, though a few weeks behind, I think managing this has been the costume department’s greatest challenge, and success. The first trimester is fine. By 20 weeks, there’s no escape. And yet no elastic waists and tent dresses for Shiv! Instead, long blazers to hide her bump, low-cut tops to distract and a clever taupe Skims bodysuit to keep that bump under wraps. Night sweats getting you down? Just tong your hair (on that – I’ve noticed continuity issues this season, with her hair going from straight to wavy mid-scene, which suggests they’re thinking about Shiv’s hair as much as I’m thinking about my own). Twitter certainly had fun mocking Shiv’s sad ponytail at Connor’s wedding. But as anyone familiar with pregnancy hormones knows, second-trimester hair has a will of its own. One of the hardest things for a pregnant woman to do is to confront this bodily shape shift while trying to maintain their identity. Most keep their pregnancies a secret for at least 12 weeks for fear of miscarriage or complications. These dangers are real – roughly 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage – and most of us would rather not risk sharing news early only to have difficult conversations later. This silence isn’t much fun. But even after this point, the risks continue and can be compounded by judgment and career retaliation – all while you try not to vomit on the hour. In the case of Shiv, that judgment is coming from her family, the tabloids and all those people who told her she’d be a terrible mother. Roman’s joke about her weight is the least of it. Caught between these duelling realities, it’s little wonder she’s gone turbo-Tom-Ford-Girlboss. It’s also little wonder she’s aligned herself with an alt-billionaire from Sweden: a country where parental rights are light years ahead of the US. The many cultural differences between Alexander Skarsgård’s Lukas Matsson and the Roy brothers are also signalled in their clothes, which set the scene long before they begin negotiations (though you could definitely envision Kendall wearing the Swede’s gold bomber jacket from the Tailgate party during his existential phase in season two). The overall aesthetic of the show has been distilled into “stealth wealth”. This aggressively bland look, which loosely translates as “cashmere and baseball caps indoors”, is more of a nebulous marketing term than an actual trend – to me, it looks like expensive normcore. For Shiv, though, it’s become a uniform and a life raft, a way of showing her skin remains in the game even if there’s a baby the length of a carrot growing within it. We dismiss clothing as superficial but it often says a lot about who we are or at least who we want to be. This is the paradox of fashion. And it is particularly true for women, especially when we are trying to keep a handle on the vast movements of life and death.

The puppy’s ears and tail are up as he approaches the bear cautiously, but with the confidence that Hunt is looking for in a bear conflict dog. This is a Karelian bear dog, a hardy breed from Finland known to be fearless and capable of standing up to large mammals such as brown bears and moose. People once used the dogs to hunt big game in regions that now are part of Russia and Finland. Today, in Montana, Hunt is using the dogs to keep bears alive. Hunt founded the Wind River Bear Institute in 1996, where she trains Karelian bear dogs to scare away bears that get too close to human settlements and that would otherwise be killed. “I wanted to make things safer for bears and people,” she says. Karelian puppies undergo a series of tests in which trainers teach them the right behaviours and evaluate their personality and how they react in situations that involve stuffed bears and cougars placed in the field. Just 20% of a litter will make the cut as bear conflict dogs, where a wrong move or slightest hesitation can lead to serious injury. “We are looking to figure out which ones have the right stuff. It is important for the safety of the people we are placing the dogs with,” says Nils Pedersen, director of the institute. “What we want to see is a dog that has an intrinsic motivation to hunt and find anything new and scary.” When they are ready, the dogs are deployed across North America – for example, working with the Alaska fire service to keep firefighters safe on callouts and at the same time reduce the number of bears that are killed each year. Between 2020 and 2022, dog handler Greg Colligan worked with one puppy on its first assignment helping to resolve conflicts between people and grizzly bears in Alaska’s Denali national park and preserve. “He was integrated into almost every facet of what we do as a wildlife management crew,” says Colligan, former lead wildlife technician for the park. “He helped us detect bears and push them out of an area if we needed to. He was key to everything we did.” Karelian bear dogs are increasingly being used by wildlife and land managers not just in the US, but in Canada and even Japan to encourage social distancing between humans and wildlife. In North America, bears live in landscapes where the human footprint is expanding. As a result, people and predators are forced to share space, setting the stage for increased human-wildlife conflicts. Bears may be tempted to visit human-dominated areas with easy to access food sources such as rubbish bins, chicken coops, bird feeders or fruit trees, especially in the summer and autumn, when they need to store energy for hibernation. With warmer temperatures resulting from the climate crisis and more human foods readily available, bears may even delay hibernation. In Nevada, an increase in the black bear population is colliding with a growth in urban development. Game biologist Heather Reich reports that between 1987 and 1991, the Nevada Department of Wildlife received an average of 14 calls reporting conflicts with bears a year. Between 2007 and 2011, that number grew to more than 500, and in 2022, 1,450 calls were received. Reich attributes the latest surge to a late spring frost that killed the bears’ natural resources such as berries. “This drove bears down into urban areas searching desperately for food,” Reich says. Clayton Lamb of the University of British Columbia studied demographic data for more than 2,500 brown bears in British Columbia over 40 years and found that in human-dominated landscapes, for every bear that lived to 14 years, 29 did not. By contrast, only four died during the same period in a wilderness area with no people to contend with. The animals that were able to survive in human-dominated areas had adopted a nocturnal lifestyle to avoid people. “If a bear can learn to live near people, they can survive, but very few bears make it to adulthood and figure out how to live in that landscape,” Lamb says. In Nevada, wildlife managers first tried to scare human-habituated black bears away with noise makers and rubber bullets, but that did not always work. “The bears very quickly learned that was not that scary and that nothing bad happened,” Reich says. In 2001, the wildlife department started employing Karelian bear dogs. Now, when a problem bear ventures too close, Reich and her colleagues catch the animal. Then, when the bear is released, the dogs chase it away in a brief pursuit. “For the bear, it is a really bad experience,” Reich says. Bears are naturally wary of canids as coyotes and wolves can kill their cubs. “The dogs have a body language, an animal-to-animal conversation that speaks much stronger to the bear than I can,” Reich says. The lesson taught by the dogs is one that the bears seem to remember. A study of black bears in the Tahoe Basin led by Mario Klip, environmental scientist at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, found that bears that had encounters with Karelian bear dogs became more nocturnal, were less active in winter, and spent less time in urban areas. “The dogs make me a better biologist because they allow me to keep bears in the landscape as long as I possibly can, rather than having to kill and remove them,” Reich says. With their keen sense of smell, bear dogs can also detect the presence of a bear early, allowing wildlife managers to take preventive measures while staying safe. “They allow me to do things with bears that I couldn’t do as a single human,” Reich says. “We have bears that den under homes. It feels a lot better crawling under these buildings with the dogs to help flush that bear out than me alone.” Ultimately, while the dogs can help save a bear’s life, humans must also do their part by securing garbage in bear-resistant containers or installing electric fences. At the Wind River Bear Institute, Hunt places an emphasis on “bear shepherding”. “It is about teaching bears and people the correct behaviours so they can live in the same area,” she says, but that will only work if people remove the lure of garbage and other temptations. As Karelian bear dogs are generally people-friendly, they can help educate people about the need to adopt behaviours that will reduce conflict. “People want to talk to you when you show up with the dogs,” Colligan says. “The dogs are a way for us to connect with bears in a human-bear conflict situation, but they also allow us as humans to connect to each other.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/23/anti-brexit-protester-steve-bray-vows-to-continue-despite-planned-crackdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:54:28Z","webTitle":"Anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray vows to continue despite planned crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/anti-brexit-protester-steve-bray-vows-to-continue-despite-planned-crackdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/23/anti-brexit-protester-steve-bray-vows-to-continue-despite-planned-crackdown","fields":{"headline":"Anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray vows to continue despite planned crackdown","bodyText":"The anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray has said he will not be deterred from his longstanding protest outside parliament as ministers were accused of an unprecedented attempt to restrict repetitive demonstrations. The government is seeking to use so-called Henry VIII powers to allow police to quash protests where a “cumulative” effect can be shown to be having a “more than minor” impact on people’s daily lives. Under the change, the police would be able to put conditions on protests such as Bray’s, taking into account the duration and content of it. Bray, 53, from Port Talbot, could potentially face arrest if he breached the terms set by police. The move opens the possibility of an end to Bray’s six years of amplified anti-Brexit protests outside parliament in a development that may be welcomed by many working in the Palace of Westminster but which is a cause of alarm among free speech campaigners. The attempted law change has been criticised as a “backdoor” attempt to pass legislation that has already been rejected. Last year, the House of Lords voted down the provision of such powers to the police by 254 votes to 240 after ministers sought to bring them in through amendments to an act of parliament. The subsequent effort this month at securing the same outcome through a statutory instrument, which the Lords does not traditionally vote down, has prompted both the advocacy group Liberty and a Lords committee to raise concerns about a potential abuse of power. Jun Pang, from Liberty, said it was a “particularly egregious” move by the government. “It is the first time it has happened, offering the least possible scrutiny for something that been rejected already,” she said. “It is a blatant attempt restrict the right to freedom of expression.” In a report published on 11 May, the House of Lords secondary legislation scrutiny committee wrote: “The Home Office has not provided any reasons for bringing the measures back in the form of secondary legislation, which is subject to less scrutiny, so soon after they were rejected in primary legislation. We are not aware of any examples of this approach being taken in the past.” Ministers have already introduced new powers through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act to enable police to put conditions on single-person protests in order “to prevent disruption”. The new statutory instrument would set a lower bar for police to meet should they wish to block Bray from protesting at his favoured spot on a traffic island near Portcullis House, a part of the parliamentary estate from where he has been able to target MPs with music and chanting. The statutory instrument would in effect redefine the “serious disruption to the life of the community” threshold that the police need to meet in order to set conditions on a protest. Bray said he would not allow the government to restrict his right to free expression. “I won’t be put off for a minute,” he said. “We have a right to protest, a basic human right. To take that away is to lead us down the path of fascism and that is not what the United Kingdom is about. The Tory government is constantly chipping away at our rights. And since leaving the European Union it seems to have given them a free rein.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The right to protest is a fundamental principle of our democracy, but we will not tolerate tactics that cause misery to people going about their day-to-day lives. “The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act improves the balance between the right to protest and the rights of others to go about their business.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/afternoon-update-government-grilled-over-kathryn-campbells-900k-job-victoria-to-end-native-timber-logging-and-qantass-record-profit","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:50:09Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Government grilled over Kathryn Campbell’s $900k job; Victoria to end native timber logging; and Qantas’s record profit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/afternoon-update-government-grilled-over-kathryn-campbells-900k-job-victoria-to-end-native-timber-logging-and-qantass-record-profit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/afternoon-update-government-grilled-over-kathryn-campbells-900k-job-victoria-to-end-native-timber-logging-and-qantass-record-profit","fields":{"headline":"Afternoon Update: Government grilled over Kathryn Campbell’s $900k job; Victoria to end native timber logging; and Qantas’s record profit","bodyText":"Good afternoon.

The Guardian understands that up to 30 families face removal from a Travelodge in Enfield and being placed in alternative temporary accommodation as their rooms have been booked by other people during Beyoncé’s Renaissance world tour in London. Beyoncé is scheduled to play five nights at the nearby Tottenham Hotspur stadium between 29 May to 4 June. About 100 rooms, two-thirds of the hotel, are currently booked out by the local council. They are occupied by families and individuals who reported themselves homeless to Enfield council, some of whom live four or five people to one room. The Guardian understands that the council failed to extend the bookings of 30 families ending during the concert’s run, meaning a number of them will have to leave. Travelodge rooms can only be booked for 28 days at a time and families have previously been moved to other accommodation at short notice when the council failed to rebook before rooms were snapped up by people attending big local events. Families told the Guardian the local authority would often wait until the final day of their booking before making another one. Families who have had to move out of the hotel temporarily say the process is incredibly disruptive. As well as having to take all of their belongings with them, they say their children ended up missing school. The Guardian understands that Enfield council had private concerns about the impact Beyoncé’s upcoming tour could have on families being housed at the Travelodge. Collette Collington, 42, has been living in the Enfield Travelodge since the start of the month. She lives in one room with her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old twin sons who have autism. She was told on Monday that she is being moved to a Travelodge in Hertfordshire on Thursday and will not return to Enfield until 4 June. “I don’t sleep as it is but this news is very distressing. It’s not good for me, my mental health and for my two youngest children who need stability because of their additional needs. Every environment we go into, it takes time for them to settle in. They have to be in the same routine. It will be very distressing for them,” she said. “It’s crazy how the council manages this, it’s like potluck,” she said. Last Monday, she had to leave her room with all of her belongings and wait in the hotel lobby as the council had failed to extend her stay in the hotel. “It was really distressing. I suffer from anxiety so I was having a panic attack and literally just cried.” She was eventually booked into another room in the hotel on the same day. Another family were left without anywhere to go last week after their booking ended. A mother with three children was left stranded outside the hotel with all of her belongings for almost 12 hours before being sent to a Travelodge in Hertfordshire. A number of families have been living in the hotel for months on end, far past the six-week legal limit. Piotr Rembikowski, a wheelchair user who lost his privately rented property in a fire, spoke to the Guardian in April. He has been living in the hotel with his wife and two sons since last August. Collington was made homeless after her private landlord increased her rent. “The biggest shock for me was coming in here and seeing all the other families. I thought I’d be the only one but then you come here and see this,” she said. “I’m grateful that I’ve got a roof over my head but it’s cramped. Both of my sons still drink formula. I have to wash both my son’s milk bottles in the bathroom sink. “[The council] knows I have two children with a disability and they still saw it fit to put us into a hotel.” An Enfield council spokesperson said: “In the event that Travelodge is not able to offer rooms for individuals and families, we will do our utmost to find other suitable accommodation with as little disruption as possible. “We recognise that hotel accommodation is not ideal for families which is why we continue to lobby for national action to address the fundamental shortfall of affordable housing.” A Travelodge spokesperson said: “We have been working with Enfield council for many years to provide short-term accommodation. All parties understand that this is a temporary arrangement until the local authority can find a more permanent solution. “At present we do have ample availability at our Enfield and nearby hotels for the dates in question that the council are welcome to book. Our rooms are subject to availability but we will always try our utmost to support Enfield council where we can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/23/belgorod-the-russian-region-being-dragged-into-putins-war-on-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:25:47Z","webTitle":"Belgorod: the Russian region being dragged into Putin’s war on Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/belgorod-the-russian-region-being-dragged-into-putins-war-on-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/23/belgorod-the-russian-region-being-dragged-into-putins-war-on-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Belgorod: the Russian region being dragged into Putin’s war on Ukraine","bodyText":"On a cool night in April, a Russian warplane dropped a bomb on to a busy city, ripping up the road and sending debris flying across the highway. No one was killed, but the explosion was so powerful that it left a 20-metre crater in the ground and blew a parked car on to the roof of a nearby shop. It’s an incident that in Ukraine is now commonplace. But the airstrike on 21 April hit a Russian city. Belgorod, a city and a region more than 600km from Moscow, is just over half an hour’s drive from the border with Ukraine, making it a vital stop for Russian supply lines, but also uniquely vulnerable. While in Moscow and St Petersburg, the effects of Russia’s invasion can be seen in the surging costs of daily life, in Belgorod the rattle of distant explosions can be felt underfoot and the sound of the conflict is audible in towns and cities. Sabotage and accidents sow chaos On Monday, a Russian anti-Kremlin militia claimed to have crossed over from Ukraine to attack two villages along the border. Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said eight people were wounded after the village came under Ukrainian artillery fire. Ukraine has disavowed any connection to the Russian partisan fighters. Another anti-Kremlin militia has said it also took part in the raid, but it was only the latest example of violence hitting the Belgorod region. Missiles launched from Belgorod have been among those that reduced cities across Ukraine to rubble, and Moscow has accused Kyiv of retaliating with attacks on the region. Since the start of the war, Russia has blamed Ukraine for striking oil-storage facilities, sabotaging a railway bridge, blowing up a munitions depot and even targeting buildings in Belgorod city with missiles. Throughout the war, Ukraine has mostly denied responsibility for attacks on Russian territory; the supply of US and other western weapons to Ukraine is contingent that they not be used to strike targets inside Russia. But with a grim irony, it’s perhaps the Russian army itself that has proven to be most disruptive to the citizens of Belgorod. Increasingly plagued by mismanagement and poor morale, Russian troops have been found responsible for a series of attacks, accidents and explosion that have fed the growing disorder in the region. In October, 11 Russian troops were killed when two fellow volunteers opened fire at a military training ground in the Belgorod region. An explosion caused by the “careless” handling of a grenade at an ammunition store killed three and injured 16 in January. Then, last month, a warplane accidentally fired its weapon into Belgorod city itself. Russia’s defence ministry described the incident as an “accidental discharge of aviation ammunition”. In the aftermath, thousands of people were evacuated from the city while an explosive close to the 20-metre crater was disposed of, according to the Tass news agency. ‘Split between two countries’ For almost a decade, Belgorod has come face to face with the violence that Russia has unleashed upon Ukraine. After fighting between Ukraine and Russian separatists broke out in the east of the country in 2014, thousands of Ukrainians fled across the border as refugees. By October 2014, Belgorod city authorities said more than 60,000 displaced Ukrainians had come to the region. Since the war broke out in February 2022, there have been reports of thousands more crossing over, particularly since the liberation of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in September last year. The New York Times reported that some Ukrainians who had been living under Russian occupation in Kharkiv feared being treated as collaborators. Prior to 2014, Russians in Belgorod travelled regularly to Kharkiv – Ukraine’s second biggest city. With only 80km between the two cities, cross-border friendships, relationships and families were not uncommon. With the outbreak of the war, some families have been separated by the border. In September, the Guardian spoke to Irina, who lives with her daughter in Belgorod, but whose ex-husband lives across the border in Kharkiv. “Our child is split between two countries,” she said. “No matter what happens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/victoria-budget-2023-big-business-and-property-investors-targeted-to-pay-states-covid-debt","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:23:58Z","webTitle":"Victorian budget 2023: big business, property investors and private schools targeted to pay state’s Covid debts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/victoria-budget-2023-big-business-and-property-investors-targeted-to-pay-states-covid-debt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/victoria-budget-2023-big-business-and-property-investors-targeted-to-pay-states-covid-debt","fields":{"headline":"Victorian budget 2023: big business, property investors and private schools targeted to pay state’s Covid debts","bodyText":"Big business and property investors are set to be slugged with new taxes and the public sector slashed in an effort to repay $31.5bn worth of emergency funds borrowed by the Victorian government at the height of the pandemic. The treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Tuesday handed down his ninth and “most difficult” budget, which details a “Covid debt repayment plan” to bring the state’s borrowings – set to total $171.4bn by 2026/27 – under control. He also announced an end to payroll tax exemptions for about 110 “high-fee” private schools, which is expected to deliver an additional $422.2m in government revenue. “We’re ensuring that while our kids will of course have memories of the trauma that was the Covid years, they won’t necessarily be paying for that trauma for the rest of their lives,” Pallas told reporters.

From July, businesses that pay more than $10m in wages nationally – or 5% of the state’s employers – will pay a “Covid debt levy” via a payroll tax surcharge of 0.5% for their Victorian employees. Businesses with national payrolls above $100m pay a 1% surcharge. From January 2024, property investors will face additional land tax charges, with landholdings worth over $300,000 to pay a $975 fee plus 0.1% of the total land value. A fee of $500 will apply for landholdings worth $50,000-$100,000; and $975 for land worth between $100,000 and $300,000. Family homes will be exempt from the changes, which Pallas said will affect 860,000 landowners who will pay an average of $1,300 in additional taxes annually. Pallas said the “Covid debt” levies were “temporary, targeted and responsible” and structured to target “those with an ability to pay”. He said big business profits were up 24% over the past three years, and landlords have seen land values increase by 84% in the past decade. Rents also rose by 25% over five years. The two measures, which will be in place for a decade, are expected to raise $8.6bn over the next four years. In an effort to soften the blow for business, stamp duty will be abolished for commercial and industrial properties in favour of an annual property tax, and business insurance duties will be phased out over the next decade. Payroll tax exemptions will be removed for about 110 high-fee private schools, which will raise $134.8m in 2024/25, increasing to $147.1m in 2026/27. The government will also double the levy paid by overseas property investors to 4%, and lift betting taxes from 10% to 15% of wagering revenue, in line with New South Wales. The government has also identified $2.1bn in savings over four years, including reducing the public service by 3,000-4,000 workers – described as a return to “pre-pandemic levels” – and scaling back the use of labour hire and consultancy firms. Pallas maintains the cuts to the public sector will not impact frontline workers such as nurses, teachers and emergency service personnel. Public sector wages – one of the government’s biggest costs – is expected to account for almost $35.3bn of expenditure in 2023/24. This has grown by almost $2bn since the pre-election budget update in November, accounting for the doubling of the public sector wage cap to 3%. The budget forecasts a deficit of $4bn this financial year – an increase of $400m since November. The deficit is then projected to shrink to $1.1bn in 2024/25, before building to surpluses of $1bn in 2025/26 and $1.2bn in 2026/27. Net debt is expected to reach $116.7bn in June this year and is expected to keep growing across the forward estimates, reaching $135.4bn next financial year and an eye-watering $171.4bn in 2026/27 – 24.4% of the state’s economy. Interest payments on state debt is forecast to total $5.6bn in this financial year – or $15m a day – up from the $5.17bn forecast six months ago. It will then grow to almost $8bn in 2026/27. The government has managed to keep a lid on blowouts of its major projects – with a $565m increase in costs (or 0.3%) – but project completion timeframes have extended by 21%. The budget rests on several key assumptions, including that inflation peaked at 7% in the 2022/23 financial year and will drop to 4.25% this year, before falling to 2.75% in 2024/25 and 2.5% in 205/56. It also assumes population growth of 3.5% in 2023/24, while unemployment grows to 4.25%. Pallas titled the budget “Doing What Matters” – the same slogan Labor used during its November election campaign – and he said it “funds every commitment made”. This includes $4.9bn for health and hospital upgrades, $2.1bn for new and upgraded schools and an initial $1bn to establish the State Electricity Commission. The budget also announced the bringing forwards of the end date of Victoria’s native timber industry from 2030 to 1 January 2024, with a $200m package to help transition workers. Aboriginal-led children and family services have also been allocated $140m. Alongside the budget, the government will introduce legislation to parliament to ensure its “future fund” – which now totals $8bn – is only drawn down to pay off debt. It was established using funds from the part-privatisation of VicRoads last year. The opposition leader, John Pesutto, on Tuesday said: “This budget shows that under Labor, Victoria is broke, life is getting harder and Victorians are being punished for the government’s incompetence”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/end-of-native-logging-in-victoria-a-monumental-win-for-forests-say-conservationists","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:18:28Z","webTitle":"End of native logging in Victoria ‘a monumental win for forests’, say conservationists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/end-of-native-logging-in-victoria-a-monumental-win-for-forests-say-conservationists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/end-of-native-logging-in-victoria-a-monumental-win-for-forests-say-conservationists","fields":{"headline":"End of native logging in Victoria ‘a monumental win for forests’, say conservationists","bodyText":"Native forest logging in Victoria will end in December, six years earlier than previously planned, after the state government decided severe bushfires and legal campaigns had made it economically and environmentally unviable. The announcement by the Andrews Labor government in Tuesday’s state budget follows a landmark supreme court judgment last November that the state-owned logging agency, VicForests, had broken the law by failing to protect endangered species. It triggered a shutdown of operations that contributed to Australia’s last white paper mill, located in the Latrobe Valley, ending production of office paper in February. Government ministers said they had brought forward a previous commitment to phase out the industry by 2030 to “deliver certainty to timber workers, sawmill operators and their communities”. They pledged an extra $200m in the budget as part of a $875m transition support package for those affected. Conservationists celebrated the decision, which comes after decades of conflict over the destruction caused by clearfell logging. In recent years campaigners have brought more than a dozen court cases alleging loggers had breached forestry laws. Chris Schuringa, from the Victorian Forest Alliance, said campaigners were “overjoyed by this historic announcement”. “This is a monumental win for forests, for wildlife, for climate, and for the hard-working people who have spent countless hours surveying for endangered species, preparing evidence for court cases, lobbying, and campaigning,” she said. “Some have been fighting for this for over three decades.” The government said bushfires, legal action and court decisions meant there were no alternative timber sources to supply the state’s mills, and there were no options for regulatory reform that could prevent further court injunctions. It said hundreds of workers had not been able to work for months after the supreme court found VicForests had failed to protect the endangered greater glider and yellow-bellied glider. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said the state needed a plan to support workers and their families. The transition package would help timber workers retrain and find new jobs and support businesses reliant on hardwood supply. “It’s not good enough for us to just cross our fingers and hope for the best,” the premier said. “That’s why we’re stepping up to give these workers, and their communities, businesses and partners along the supply chain, the certainty they deserve.” The treasurer, Tim Pallas, told reporters he felt a “great degree of sympathy” for forestry workers and communities. “We don’t take any satisfaction in this,” he said. “The advice that we’ve got is that, legally, there will be no way through this if the courts have been used the way that they have, effectively to frustrate this industry.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The decision means both Victoria and Western Australia will end native forest logging by next year. There are no plans to end logging in New South Wales or Tasmania. The Australian Greens said the ban should be national. “If the Albanese government is serious about fighting climate change and protecting our environment it must now follow the lead of Victoria … and stop all native forest logging,” said the party’s forest spokesperson, Janet Rice. Calls for the Victorian government to quickly end native forestry have escalated since the catastrophic 2019-20 black summer bushfires, which burned more than 1.5 hectares across the state and reduced the livable habitat for dozens of threatened species by more than half. The reduction in areas available for logging due to the fires affected the industry’s economic viability, which was already under question. VicForests reported a $54.2m loss in its last annual report. The government said it would develop a program for the management of 1.8m hectares of land previously allocated for logging. It said this would “deliver the largest expansion to our public forests in our state’s history”. It said an advisory panel would be established to recommend forest areas that should be protected as national parks and areas that would be suitable for other recreational uses. It would also consider opportunities for management by traditional owners. The state opposition said the industry employed 2500 people and communities would be “shattered by this decision”. “Daniel Andrews and Labor are punishing regional Victorian communities to advance a radical green agenda that panders to inner-city Greens voters,” the Coalition’s agriculture spokesperson, Emma Kealy, said. The union representing timber workers accused the state government of failing to consult the industry. “It’s a shame that [Andrews] only governs for Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. If you’re in any other part of the state, you don’t get a look in,” the national secretary of the CFMEU, Michael O’Connor, said. ‘Monumental day’ Sarah Rees, who has campaigned for the creation of a great forest national park, said the decision was “a win for communities, endangered species and testimony to the Andrews government’s commitment to climate change”. But she said damage from fires and logging meant the state’s forests would need investment – beyond that offered to timber workers – to back recreation plans and to restore degraded land. Prof David Lindenmayer, an Australian National University ecologist who has researched Victoria’s forests for decades, said the decision would be good for the local environment, the economy and the climate. He said its effect would be equivalent to preventing greenhouse gas emissions from 730,000 cars every year. “A major workforce will be needed to build new tourism infrastructure, protect and then boost carbon stocks, tackle problems with exploding numbers of feral deer and develop elite fire-fighting crews to make rural communities safe,” he said. The national campaigns director for the Wilderness Society, Amelia Young, said “living, breathing, intact forests” were the best safeguard against the climate crisis. “It’s crucial that workers and families, who have been led astray about the longevity of Victoria’s native logging industry, are properly supported,” she said. Alana Mountain, a forest campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: “This is justice for climate, forests, and humanity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/may/23/ways-of-life-jim-ede-and-the-kettles-yard-artists-by-laura-freeman-review-an-intimate-account-of-a-life-in-art-ben-nicholson-david-jones-barbara-hepworth-alfred-wallis-henri-gaudier-brzeska","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Ways of Life: Jim Ede and the Kettle’s Yard Artists by Laura Freeman review – an intimate tale of a life in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/23/ways-of-life-jim-ede-and-the-kettles-yard-artists-by-laura-freeman-review-an-intimate-account-of-a-life-in-art-ben-nicholson-david-jones-barbara-hepworth-alfred-wallis-henri-gaudier-brzeska","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/23/ways-of-life-jim-ede-and-the-kettles-yard-artists-by-laura-freeman-review-an-intimate-account-of-a-life-in-art-ben-nicholson-david-jones-barbara-hepworth-alfred-wallis-henri-gaudier-brzeska","fields":{"headline":"Ways of Life: Jim Ede and the Kettle’s Yard Artists by Laura Freeman review – an intimate biography of a life in art","bodyText":"On New Year’s Day 1956, Jim Ede, then 60, wrote to his friend, the painter and poet David Jones, of a “quixotic scheme” he had for the remaining years of his life. Ede, who had been a curator at the Tate Gallery before the second world war, and a pioneering collector of the art of his friends and heroes – Jones, and the St Ives group of painters, and Miró and Brancusi – outlined in that letter an impulse to create a modest and lasting monument to what he had learned about art and about life. Ede had in mind, he wrote, “a place of beauty in a town”, a home that would be open to students and to the public and allow him to share “all that I have in pictures and lovely objects”. It took him the best part of that year to find and buy four semi-derelict cottages just over Magdalene Bridge in Cambridge, once home to a playhouse owned by a Mr Joseph Kettle. Ede set to work making every corner of his Kettle’s Yard gallery a still life. For nearly 20 years he and his wife, Helen, welcomed the curious into their home. Ede, who died in 1990 aged 95, gave personal tours of the paintings and sculptures and the favourite found objects – pebbles and feathers and shells. He encouraged students to borrow original pieces to decorate undergraduate walls. Visitors were invited to sit down at the kitchen table with Jim and Helen for tea in china cups and hot buttered toast with marmalade cold from the fridge. Laura Freeman’s biography of Ede is in part a life of the objects that he collected and the stories they tell. Each of her chapters begins with a picture of a Kettle’s Yard treasure and takes flight from there. Freeman, chief art critic at the Times, writes with an exact enthusiasm about the things she describes. Ede thought of his paintings and sculptures as favourite house guests, and the reader of this book might well come to imagine them in that way too. At the heart of it, and from the beginning, Ede cuts a singular figure. “When Jim was 12,” Freeman writes, “when all the boys were buying the bicycles that were all the Edwardian rage, he bought a Queen Anne desk for £8.” A sensitive child of middle-class Methodist parents – his father was a Cambridge-educated solicitor with a practice in Cardiff – he was both nearly destroyed and saved by the first world war. Ede never thought not to join up – though how could he, “who believed in love, friendship, art and beauty” and who was enthralled by Helen Schlapp, beautiful daughter of a German professor? His ordeal in the trenches, however, meant at least that his stern parents would indulge his desire to lead an unconventional life: he might be a bohemian, they reasoned, but at least he was alive. Freeman intimates a life of unspoken homosexual desire in Ede. Still, he loved his wife. When they married he looked so “young and flustered” that the registrar at Chelsea asked Helen if her betrothed was a minor. “No,” she sighed, “he’s an art student.” The point of art, Ede insisted, “was not to make maps but to adventure”. In this spirit, he and Helen first set up home in Hampstead with their two daughters, then moved to a modernist house Ede built in Tangier in the 1930s, then led a wandering life out of a Buick in the US during the war as Ede lectured on art at universities to support relief funds back home, then bought an idyllic cottage in the Loire valley, before settling in Cambridge. At Kettle’s Yard they had separate bedrooms, connected by a speaking tube. Freeman documents their long lives in fabulous detail. Some of her source material is an unpublished memoir Ede wrote in his 80s; some comes from the compulsive letters he wrote to TE Lawrence – whom he befriended through the Tate – and Jones, and the Nicholsons and the self-taught Cornish artist Alfred Wallis, who Ede helped make an art-world star. The gaps are filled with interviews with surviving friends and relatives, undergraduate visitors to Kettle’s Yard – everyone from Edmund de Waal to Nicholas Serota. Ede had pivotal walk-on roles in many more famous lives; the visitors’ book at his grand, unaffordable house in Hampstead records wonderful dinners and parties with Henry Moore and Graham Greene and Edith Evans and John Gielgud and Vanessa Bell. Here, he is given centre stage. Stories tumble over one another: of the great flood at the Tate (then called the National Gallery of British Art) in 1928, with Ede up to his waist in water trying to save the Turner seascapes; of Ede’s attempts to persuade Johanna Bonger, widow of Van Gogh’s brother Theo, to sell some of her paintings – including Sunflowers – that she had stacked in a back bedroom, and then to persuade his reluctant bosses at the Tate to buy them. Ede “was young, fun, enthusiastic, full of ideas and ignored”, Freeman writes. That latter judgment perhaps provoked the best investment that he ever made. In 1926, the life’s work of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, the young genius French sculptor killed in the first world war aged 23, was “dumped in the Tate boardroom”. Ede’s insistence that they were in the presence of “a Michelangelo in miniature” led to him being dismissed “to supervise the cleaning of the gallery windows”. He trusted his eye, though, and with a little subterfuge bought the entire collection of Gaudier-Brzeska’s drawings and letters for £60. If Kettle’s Yard remains the expression of that collectors’ eye, this book gives you the backstory of all the cunning and determination that went into creating it. From beginning to end, Freeman employs first names for Ede and his circle – Jim and Ben and Winifred and Henry. The choice is right because this is a book that involves you so closely in the lives of its subjects that you think of them as friends, alive to their plans and schemes, their fallings in and out of love. Freeman’s attention falls on each particular of Ede’s life and turns it over like a polished pebble in a jacket pocket. Along with his gallery, this book is the legacy he might have wished for.

I know how to behave when friends get a baby","bodyText":"I always assume that when a person gets a new dog, the household lives for a period in new-baby territory. That is to say, anyone is allowed to visit whenever they like as long as they bring something diverting and indulgent – a card trick, vodka – and don’t expect so much as a glass of water. This turns out not to be true. I had to lobby for weeks to be invited to meet my friend’s new dachshund and when we arrived, it turned out “lunch” meant actual lunch, which wasn’t what I meant at all. I was thinking more, have some Frazzles, hug the dog, hug the older dog so it didn’t feel left out, do that a few more times, then go for a walk. The etiquette is the opposite of new-baby rules: you have to think of some things to talk about that aren’t the dog. You shouldn’t really make minute-by-minute observations about the activities of the dog, or speculate about its feelings, or hypothesise about the extent of its consciousness or comprehension. Its owners have already had these conversations; they were hoping you would arrive with something new. If they do take you out for a walk, and you pass some other people on a beautiful early summer’s day, and they stop to pet the new dog because, let’s face it, it’s so small, it’s bad form to pretend the dog is yours by making proprietorial statements such as: “Yes, she does have a lovely nature, thank you for noticing”, and: “Yes, this is her dad, but look how different they are in colouring.” I don’t know why it’s so wrong, but it is, and I knew that when I was doing it. If the dog is extremely small, being both a miniature version of an already small breed and three months old, and you are used to a larger-boned canine, take extra care not to tread on the dog. Know when to leave – it’s easy with a baby: you leave when it starts crying. If you wait for a puppy to start getting on your nerves, you may as well move in. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2023/may/23/the-little-known-london-train-ticket-that-could-save-you-eurostar-hassle","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"The little-known London train ticket that could save you Eurostar hassle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/23/the-little-known-london-train-ticket-that-could-save-you-eurostar-hassle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/may/23/the-little-known-london-train-ticket-that-could-save-you-eurostar-hassle","fields":{"headline":"The little-known London train ticket that could save you Eurostar hassle","bodyText":"Two weeks ago I caught a train from Stafford to London Euston that was due to arrive at lunchtime – in time to catch the Eurostar to Brussels two hours later. However there was a fatality on the line at Rugby, and all trains were cancelled going into London on the west coast mainline. I ended up having to change my ticket from St Pancras to Brussels, at a cost of £125. Eurostar stated that it wasn’t on their service, so it wasn’t their responsibility. I have come to the conclusion that Eurostar is basically a service for people living in London only as people resident in other parts of the country cannot rely on the service being flexible. What do you think? CC, Stafford While I have a great deal of sympathy for you, I don’t really think Eurostar is responsible in this case, as you bought two separate train tickets. Had you been travelling to Heathrow to get a flight you missed, you wouldn’t expect the airline to give you a free alternative flight. Your travel insurance should cover this. However, the reason for running this letter is to tell you and others about little-known train tickets that cover you in cases like these. Had you bought a CIV train ticket, Eurostar would have been obliged to put you on the next train for free. You can only buy these tickets in person at a staffed station (not online) and you need to show your Eurostar booking to qualify.

The elite military units operate in secret, without ministers publicly confirming their activities. But a research group, Action on Armed Violence, has compiled a list of their activities since 2011 based on media leaks. It paints a picture of members of the SAS, Special Boat Service and Special Reconnaissance Regiment, being repeatedly deployed by the prime minister and defence secretary to conduct high-risk missions, typically where the UK is not at war. Special forces have been particularly active in Syria, with reports of them entering the country from 2012 to help rebel groups fighting against President Bashar al-Assad. They are also reported to have been sent in 2013 to identify military targets in advance of a bombing campaign that MPs ended up voting against. But such was the obsession with secrecy that when one SAS member, Matt Tonroe, was killed by in Syria in 2018, he was officially described as a member of the Parachute regiment. It later emerged he was not killed by an improvised explosive device but by the accidental detonation of a grenade carried by his US colleague. Fifty members of UK special forces were listed as being present in Ukraine earlier this year in leaked Pentagon papers, although Britain is not formally party to the conflict; by contrast, the numbers from the US and France were listed as 14 and 15, respectively. Their purpose, however, was not stated. The authors of the report said that the extensive list of deployments came despite a lack of oversight. While convention dictates that MPs have to vote for a war, special forces can be deployed without Commons approval – and their actions are not subject to investigation by any parliamentary committee. At one point, shortly after 38 people – including 30 Britons – were killed by a terrorist at a beach hotel in Tunisia in June 2015, it was reported that the SAS had been given “carte blanche” by David Cameron, who was then prime minister, to capture or kill Islamist leaders in the Middle East. “The extensive deployment of Britain’s Special Forces in numerous countries over the past decade raises serious concerns about transparency and democratic oversight,” said Iain Overton, the executive director of AOAV. “The lack of parliamentary approval and retrospective reviews for these missions is deeply troubling.” This March, however, a public inquiry began into allegations that the SAS were responsible for 54 summary killings in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011, typically on night raids. Men were separated from their families and repeatedly shot dead after being said to have produced a weapon. Special forces took part in the rescue of two dozen British diplomats and their families from Khartoum in April after the outbreak of fighting in Sudan, evacuating them to an airfield north of the capital, when they were at risk of coming under attack. At the time, the Tory MP Ben Wallace, who is now defence secretary, praised the military effort involved. However, the Ministry of Defence said the operation involved members of the Parachute regiment, the Royal Marines and the RAF but it did not mention special forces. Special forces frequently participate in hostage rescues as well as exfiltrations. A group of SBS commandos tried and failed to rescue a Briton and an Italian held by an Islamist group in Nigeria in 2012, but a couple held in the Philippines were successfully rescued in 2019 in a mission that UK special forces helped to plan, and for which it trained the country’s military. The only deployment in Russia mentioned in the media dates back to 2014, when a tabloid newspaper reported that SAS soldiers were “on hand” to protect the security of British athletes at the winter Olympics in Sochi. The full list of countries also includes Algeria, Estonia, France, Oman, Iraq, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Cyprus, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. It was sent to the Ministry of Defence, although the ministry routinely says it does not comment on the activity of special forces. An MoD spokesperson said: “It is the longstanding policy of successive governments not to comment on UK Special Forces.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/23/rishi-sunak-wealth-public-opinion-general-election-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak thinks voters don’t care about his vast wealth, but the pollsters aren’t so sure | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/rishi-sunak-wealth-public-opinion-general-election-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/rishi-sunak-wealth-public-opinion-general-election-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak thinks voters don’t care about his vast wealth, but the pollsters aren’t so sure","bodyText":"The prime minister sincerely hopes, as he said last week, that we’ve “moved beyond judging people by what’s in their bank account.” Is that so? Attitudes to wealth and inequality are confusing and often inconsistent. But Sunak’s phenomenal fortune seems deeply unhelpful for his electoral prospects. Those in his stratosphere have prospered exponentially, especially in the past decade, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list. Their gravity-defying golden era, untouched by the banking crash, Brexit or the pandemic, only this year suffered a blip. Sunak, the first prime minister to feature, and his wife, Akshata Murty, are listed at £529m, down from £730m last year. It’s hard to comprehend such numbers. The pair lost £500,000 a day – a day – for 12 months, yet even that is too little to touch lifestyles in this hyper-realm. Does it matter that Sunak belongs to this tiny golden clan? Yes, say the pollsters. “His wealth is beyond comprehension,” says Chris Hopkins of Savanta. “People feel he’s out of touch, not normal. How can he legislate on the cost of living, with no experience of their lives?” Labour ads go for the jugular: “Do you think it’s right to raise taxes for working people when your family has benefited from a tax loophole? Rishi Sunak does.” On tax avoidance, the Labour line chimes with the Fairness Foundation’s finding that eight in 10 people, including 79% of Tory voters, think the wealthy don’t contribute their fair share of taxes. Labour’s own research finds Sunak’s super-wealth “matters a lot, as it means he can’t imagine, and so doesn’t care, about people’s reality,” one Labour source told me. Attacking his wealth shows Labour no longer fears being accused of “the politics of envy” but expects to strike a chord with its own “politics of empathy”. The top 1% are now seen as more powerful than government, reports a cross-party group of MPs this week: 39% rank the very rich as most powerful, while only 24% think governments hold the real power, reversing opinion in the last five years. Prof Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute, described this as “a remarkable shift in a short period of time.” It matches Fairness Foundation polling showing that almost 70% of people are concerned at some owning over £10m while others live in poverty. Yet wealth is still tricky political terrain to navigate. How people make money matters: Fairness Foundation polling shows entrepreneurs and sports stars are deserving, and so, oddly, are landlords, whose wealth is seen as fair by 53%, unfair only by 13%. But the figures for financiers are not as convincing. Inheritance wealth, says the poll, is “fair” for both new-money and old-money heirs; and while the progressive instinct is to raise inheritance tax, the public is in favour of inherited wealth. Protecting your children is a reflex deeper than politics. The question of who is rich is fraught. A fascinating new book, Uncomfortably Off: Why the Top 10% of Earners Should Care About Inequality, by Marcos González Hernando and Gerry Mitchell, surveys unhappiness and insecurity at the top. The top 10% constitute the most unequal group, stretching from those who earn £60,000 at the bottom to the 0.1% whose multimillions and billions shoot off the graph. This powerful group are leaders of business and professions, yet are almost all much further from the top than they are to the median. Most of them feel increasingly insecure, running on a hamster wheel, yet making little progress as pay retreats for them, too. Because they’re more likely to compare themselves to those above them, rather than those below, they don’t feel rich, and tend to be ignorant of how far above the ordinary they are. They feel insecure. According to the IFS in the book, a quarter won’t be in the top 10% in a year’s time. Half will fall out of this category within five years, due to economic shocks, illness or bad luck. They think they’re already overtaxed, seriously underestimating how much they need state services over the course of their life, particularly during their expensive elderly years. Austerity has so damaged society that the worse public services become – ambulance response times, unprosecuted crimes and cash-strapped schools – the less willing people are to pay more tax to fund these services. They fear that their children, who already earn less, will be unable to afford their parents’ lifestyle. The book is addressed to these 9.9% of people in the top bracket, warning them of worse to come. Investing in a good society will do them more good than trying and failing to mimic the isolated individualism of the super-rich. The 9.9%, like the rest, want the super-rich to pay more.

Classified as “control zones” by the Russian government, the region gets little aid from officials; the cost of combating fires is considered to be excessive compared to the damage done. Focusing on the rural village of Shologon, Alexander Abaturov’s evocative documentary chronicles the heroic efforts of the indigenous community to protect their homes. Largely populated by elderly people, women and children, Shologon has little equipment to slow the deadly spread of “the Dragon”, the locals’ nickname for the powerful forest fires. What they possess in spades, however, is astonishing resilience and camaraderie in the face of unprecedented calamity. Images of the villagers swathed in clouds of black smoke are accompanied by a child’s reading of an ancient folk tale, which speaks of a mighty and toxic wind – a profound juxtaposition that connotes how their fight for survival has existed for generations. Languidly oscillating between a wintry snow-white landscape, the orange hue of the fires and the blue of the villagers’ traditional clothing, the astonishing cinematography (by Paul Guilhaume) evokes the hand-tinted, expressionistic visuals of nature documentaries from the silent era. Visually gorgeous as it is, the film’s deliberately laconic style occasionally runs the risk of reducing a pressing issue into abstraction. Considering how remote Shologon is, more contextual information on the area’s society and politics would have made Paradise an even more substantial work of nonfiction. • Paradise is released on 26 May at Bertha DocHouse, London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2023/may/23/im-glad-my-symptoms-have-a-name-three-women-on-their-struggles-with-adenomyosis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘I’m glad my symptoms have a name’: three women on their struggles with adenomyosis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/23/im-glad-my-symptoms-have-a-name-three-women-on-their-struggles-with-adenomyosis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/23/im-glad-my-symptoms-have-a-name-three-women-on-their-struggles-with-adenomyosis","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m glad my symptoms have a name’: three women on their struggles with adenomyosis","bodyText":"Karen Dugmore, 44, from Birmingham, had normal periods until after she had her children. “I had two children within three years and started to feel serious pain around my time of the month at age 35. I went to the doctor and was told it was period pains, so I just got on with it.” By the time she was 41, during the pandemic, she had taken significant turn for the worse. “I began bleeding so much that if I stood up, blood clots would fall to the floor. I was wearing five sanitary towels in an hour and it felt as if I was peeing blood into the towels. I was anaemic and so unwell.” She was working from home at the time and so put up with it, she said, until she had a conversation with a female colleague. “She said to me: ‘It shouldn’t be like that.’” Untypically for women with adenomyosis, Karen was diagnosed with the condition within eight months of getting in touch with her doctor. “I felt lucky from start to finish,” she said. “But I am sitting here, in pain. It’s constant. I think hysterectomy may be the only option, although I am having injections to medically induce menopause first, to see if that helps. I am glad this is being spoken about. I have struggled to explain the pain. “I’ve never heard anyone describe the condition like the doctor on Naga Munchetty’s show on Monday. It was so informative. Only last night I felt as if I had the bowling ball feeling in my stomach and actually thought I was imagining it.” Sarah, from Hampshire, was diagnosed with the condition at the age of 43, after suffering with severe pain and bleeding since the age of 14. “It took almost 30 years for me to get a diagnosis,” the 50-year-old said. “I had heavy periods my whole life, and was given the pill at a young age to try to lessen the bleeding, but the pain was terrible every day. I would be doubled over in pain often, in the middle of the street, and later in life I had steroid injections in my hips which turned out to be unnecessary. “My whole life, I was on pain killers and told by doctors that I was suffering from IBS. This condition made my uterus large and tilted which impacted other parts of my stomach, but this was not IBS.” After her second pregnancy, Sarah’s bleeding became so uncontrollable that she “couldn’t do very much”. “I went to the GP to say I could no longer cope and she agreed that it might be endometriosis. Luckily, I had private medical cover and got a speedy referral.” The consultant suspected adenomyosis after a scan, and advised Sarah to undergo a hysterectomy, which she did a few weeks later. “They said it was the only solution, but they could only confirm I had adenomyosis after I’d had the surgery.” Sarah, who works in education and had two children at the age of 34 and 37, did not intend to have any more and says her life has hugely improved since she has recovered from the hysterectomy. “It removed my pain completely. This is a little-known condition that is hugely debilitating and more should be done to raise awareness and understanding.” For Emma Lewis-Kalubowila, 38, getting more information about her own body and pain was “really powerful”, she said, referring to her finding out that she had adenomyosis on top of endometriosis. “I’d never heard of adenomyosis before, until my own diagnosis. I was diagnosed with endometriosis six, seven years ago, but after having kids something felt different. Bloating, a heavy “full” feeling and tenderness in my stomach. It was different to the endo pain – and I was worried it was something sinister.” After a long wait to be seen in hospital, Emma, who lives in Stockport, had a diagnostic MRI in December that confirmed adenomyosis. “I felt so much better knowing what I had, and allayed my fears about what it was – I thought it could have been ovarian or womb cancer, given my symptoms.” Like others, Lewis-Kalubowila said she had been given conflicting advice. “I feel passed from pillar to post, but it’s so helpful to read and hear other people’s experiences,” she said. For the moment, Emma is managing the condition with Ibuprofen. “I’ve asked to be put on a different contraceptive pill to see if that brings relief. There are some days when you have to curl up in bed, but you can live a good life with this condition. I’m just glad to know my symptoms have a name.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2023/may/23/10-best-art-galleries-in-europe-visit-by-train","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Missed out on Vermeer?

I cannot believe how often there is no choice but to email you about Suella Braverman, but here we are again. Hot on the heels of an appearance at the National Conservatism conference that left Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson having to deny that the home secretary’s call for a cut to legal migration numbers was evidence of a rift, Downing Street is now facing a more ridiculous crisis of her making: the question of whether she broke the ministerial code by asking for special treatment after she was caught speeding. Last night, the Guardian reported that the most senior civil servant in the Home Office was aware of the allegations, while the Times reported (£) that officials had emailed their concerns to the Cabinet Office’s ethics team. Now the question is whether Sunak will order an investigation. The central weirdness of all this: for a while now, it has seemed that Sunak has been bending over backwards to keep Braverman in the cabinet, while the home secretary has appeared quite relaxed about the prospect of being fired – but not yet. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s political editor, Pippa Crerar, is about why that is, and Braverman’s prospects for survival. Here are the headlines. Five big stories NHS | Thousands of hospital staff are reporting claims of sexual assaults and harassment by patients, an investigation has found, prompting calls for ministers to address the “daily threat of abuse” faced by doctors and nurses. More than 20,000 alleged incidents were recorded in the five years to 2022. Turkey | The nationalist candidate who came third in the first round of the Turkish presidential elections has formally endorsed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, with the runoff vote to be held on 28 May. Sinan Oğan, 55, emerged as a potential kingmaker after neither Erdoğan nor his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu secured the necessary majority in the first round. Madeleine McCann | An active search for Madeleine McCann is to be carried out for the first time in nearly a decade in a reservoir in Portugal. Police officers are to search Barragem do Arade reservoir near the town of Silves in the Algarve, about 25 miles (40km) from Praia da Luz where Madeleine disappeared in 2007. Greece | Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said he will push for a repeat poll “as soon as possible” after his centre-right New Democracy party fell five seats short of an outright majority. While New Democracy’s landslide victory was not enough to form a single-party government, a second vote would be held under a system granting the winning party as many as 50 bonus seats. Donald Trump | Author and columnist E Jean Carroll is seeking “very substantial” additional damages from Donald Trump after he called her a “whack job” telling a “fake” story during a televised CNN town hall just a day after he was found liable for sexually assaulting her. Carroll is seeking an additional $10m in compensatory damages, and more in punitive damages. In depth: ‘It suits Sunak to keep her if he can – she represents the rightwing of the party’ When Suella Braverman was attorney general, she was caught speeding in a 50mph zone. Like anybody else in the same position, she was given a choice: accept a fine and points on her licence, or attend a speed awareness course. On its own, this would be insignificant, albeit entertaining in the light of claims that she asked if she could claim speeding tickets on expenses on her first day as an MP. The allegation against Braverman is that she then sought a course of action that would not have been available to anybody else. In stories published over the weekend, the Sunday Times (£) and Mail on Sunday claimed that she asked civil servants to help her arrange a one-to-one session in lieu of the ordinary group course. When civil servants declined, a special adviser allegedly tried to work out other options that would avoid revealing her identity to other participants. Sources close to Braverman deny all this, and say that she was asking for advice about how to book the course, rather than telling civil servants to act on her behalf. In the end, Braverman paid the fine and took the points. For more detail, see Heather Stewart’s explainer from Sunday. *** So what? Some observers view this as trivia: Simon Jenkins writes that stories like this are “how the system crowds out discussion of things that matter”. Others say that it matters not because she sought a private session – which other prominent people have also tried, the publicity-shy lawyer known as Mr Loophole says – but because of the claim she denies that she directed civil servants to get involved in her personal affairs. The other issue is whether Braverman and her team were honest in their responses to journalists who asked about it. In other words: it’s trivial if Braverman’s version of events is correct, but it might not be if it isn’t. “If she asked for advice, as her spokesperson said, that might be poor judgment, but it’s not a breach of the ministerial code, or it’s a minor one,” Pippa Crerar said. “If she directed civil servants to arrange a private course, that’s potentially more serious. You’re not allowed to ask civil servants to help with your private affairs. And there are claims that journalists were told she hadn’t even committed a speeding offence. If that’s true, then as always, it can be the cover-up that gets you.” *** Why has it come out now? One claim to have done the rounds since Sunday is the idea that Braverman is the victim of a “smear campaign” because of her stance on migration. Miriam Cates, an ally on the Tory backbenches, told the Daily Telegraph: “It is no coincidence that it’s in the same week that she had been very vocal about the need to put proper limits on legal migration.” But there are two big problems with that theory. One is that … it does, in fact, appear to have been coincidence. We know this because the Daily Mirror reports that it put the suggestion Braverman had been caught speeding to her special adviser six weeks ago – when even that part of the story was denied. You might still say that even if Braverman’s speech last week was not the trigger, the leak could still be the result of disquiet at her general conduct as a minister. But that would have more weight if Braverman could show clearly that the claim that she inappropriately asked civil servants to intervene was unfair: instead, Cates and other supporters have little to say about the rights and wrongs of the underlying allegation. “We have seen, for weeks, the narrative from Braverman blaming ‘the blob’ of civil servants for frustrating government,” Pippa said. “The claim that this has been a response to events of the last week forgets that this has been on the agenda for some time.” When considering that theory of the problems faced by Braverman and Dominic Raab, who had to resign over bullying allegations and yesterday announced he will stand down at the next election, we might also ask why other ministers of the same political stripe have not faced similar alleged conspiracies. *** What will Sunak do? Initially, Downing Street said that the prime minister had spoken to his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus and had been “availing himself of information” about the case. But there was no news on whether he would order an investigation by the end of the day. While Braverman has been a regular source of headaches for Sunak since she was appointed as his home secretary only days after resigning as Liz Truss’s because she improperly shared official documents with a backbencher, “it suits Sunak to keep her there if he can”, Pippa said. “She represents the rightwing of the party, and the grassroots may align pretty closely with what she believes. And while the ‘one nation’ wing of the party like to claim Sunak as their own, he’s quite socially conservative.” On the other hand, Sunak will face pressure to live up to his now-infamous promise of “integrity, professionalism and accountability”. (Peter Oborne examines his record in this piece.) And it is not clear that the parliamentary party will be pleased if he fights for her: she is well to the right of many of them, and there is frustration at what is seen as an appetite for self-serving publicity. In this piece, Pippa quotes one Tory MP who says: “Rishi needs to make it clear to her that she is either a team player or a backbencher.” *** How has Braverman reacted? Braverman did speak about the issue yesterday – and said she was “confident that nothing untoward has happened”, but refused to specifically deny the allegations. Whatever the truth, it highlights one of the oddities of the home secretary’s approach to her role: she appears less committed to substantive outcomes than she is to persuading the party membership of her rightwing credentials. Pippa said: “Some Tory MPs believe that while she is enjoying having a big, influential job, if it looks like they’re going to lose when we’re closer to an election, she might decide she’s better off in a position where she’s free to set out her own stall – and able to distance herself from a defeat – ahead of a possible leadership run.” But it is probably too soon to be an optimal moment to leave the cabinet from that point of view – and this is hardly the subject she would choose to depart over, even if she seeks to paint it as the product of a conspiracy by “the blob”. *** What happens next? If Sunak does ask Magnus to investigate, “they will try to do it very quickly – in a matter of days”, Pippa said. It will then be a question of whether there is hard evidence, potentially in the form of emails, that Braverman either deliberately misled the media or directed officials to act on her behalf over the speeding offence. But even an adverse finding from Magnus might not mean curtains for Braverman. Think of the Dominic Raab case – where the minister quit, but only because he had pledged to do so rather than under any apparent directive from Downing Street. “Under the rules as they now are, the prime minister doesn’t have a binary choice between keeping her and sacking her – there are other sanctions at his disposal, like demanding an apology, or docking a chunk of her salary,” Pippa said. And it is entirely possible that Magnus could find a breach at the lesser end of the scale, and one which Braverman could plausibly survive. What else we’ve been reading Postnatal depression is a condition that is primarily associated with women, but experts are now suggesting that men are just as susceptible to it. Ammar Kalia spoke to new fathers about their experiences and the hidden impact of male postnatal depression. Nimo There’s a whole cultural genre of stories about the deranged behaviour of celebrity fans – but, Michael Bond argues, the evidence suggests that fandom in fact has a “remarkably positive influence on people’s lives”. He writes: “Most fans are on a search for meaning, and they are prepared to give a great deal of themselves to find it.” Archie Anthony Broadwater spent 16 years in prison and two decades on a sex-offenders registry for a crime that he never committed. Alice Sebold spent all of her adult life reckoning with a rape that changed her perception of the world – only to find out the person she helped convict the wrong person. In the New Yorker (£), Rachel Aviv tells the harrowing story of these two people whose lives have been bound together by injustice and institutional failures. Nimo I loved Arifa Akbar’s five star review of Ruth Wilson’s 24-hour performance of The Second Woman at the Young Vic. Arifa’s account of what it’s like to be part of an audience for that long, and the perils of a packed house for her hopes of stretching out and using her travel pillow, is compelling enough; Wilson’s many iterations of the same scene with different partners sound remarkable. Archie Emine Saner’s decision to spend £2,000 on her pet guinea pig’s hysterectomy raised many eyebrows. Saner writes movingly about her unforgettable pet and why she doesn’t regret spending a penny on Ruby. Nimo Sport Premier League | Newcastle United sealed a place in the Champions League for the first time in 20 years with a 0-0 draw against Leicester. The result also means that Leicester must win against West Ham and hope Everton fail to beat Bournemouth in the final game of the season if they are to avoid relegation. Women’s Champions League | The majority of Women’s Champions League matches will be shown behind a paywall next season, with the broadcaster Dazn believing the time is right to “accelerate the value” of the women’s game. Dazn had previously intended to stream all 61 games for free on its YouTube channel but will now reserve 42 of them for its subscription service. Cycling | Mark Cavendish has announced he will retire from professional cycling at the end of the current season. The 38-year-old sprinter has 53 Grand Tour stage victories, a world title, and is still planning to compete at the Tour de France in July. William Fotheringham wrote that Cavendish “is almost unique for a sprinter, both in terms of longevity, and the depth and breadth of his results”. The front pages “Thousands of hospital staff report claims of sexual abuse by patients” is the Guardian’s splash today. The Times has “Green quango blamed for blocking new homes” – quango is a great and underused portmanteau, meaning “quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation”, and the quango in question is Natural England. “Police search reservoir for Madeleine” says the Daily Express, while the Sun calls developments in Portugal the “Riddle of the lake”. “Maddie cops search lake” says the Daily Mirror and “New hunt for Maddie” is the Metro’s headline – it refers to a “dig” taking place at the reservoir. The Financial Times leads with “Meta handed record €1.2bn European fine over transatlantic data transfers”. “No 10 leaves Braverman waiting on her future” – that’s the i and the Daily Telegraph has “London ‘left behind’ by financial rival cities”. The top story in the Daily Mail is “Revealed: Plot to drive out equality chief who’s standing up for women”. Today in Focus From pollution to policing – can Sadiq Khan clean up London?

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Asked how she felt making a joint announcement with One Nation, the Greens MP Amy MacMahon said the crossbench was “united” on this issue despite their vast “political differences”. “We’re set to lose a state primary school … all for a two-week event that the majority of people in our electorates won’t be able to afford to go to,” she said, referring to the East Brisbane state school. “The evidence from Games right around the world is that prices go up, rates go up and people get actively displaced from their neighbourhoods … we’re seeing gentrification fuelled by the Olympic Games.” Bolton said some of her constituents in the Sunshine Coast were also facing housing difficulties and she feared the Games would exacerbate the crisis. “What we really need is a strategy and a plan on how this is going to be mitigated,” she said. Robbie Katter, the leader of the KAP, said Queensland needs to have a “sobering” look at the Games and the “enormous vortex” it’ll create for future infrastructure projects. “Everyone’s getting excited about it but we’re tasked with holding the government to account,” Katter said. “That makes you a bit unpopular because everyone likes the idea of having a party and having a new stadium, but there is a cost.” Katter said his party was “sick of asking” for renal units and CT scanners, and “being told there’s no money for it when they can find money for brand-new stadiums”. “We didn’t compete for the Olympic Games, no one else in the world wanted it – it fell in our lap,” he said. A government spokesperson said “there are no gold medals for booing” and that government funding for the regions “eclipses Olympic spending by a considerable margin”. They said the Queensland government’s share of funding on Olympic infrastructure is $3.7bn over the next decade, with the federal government providing $3.4bn. “Nothing is being built just for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The idea has always been to accelerate projects in time for 2032 that will have lasting benefits for the community long after.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/23/nhs-dentist-numbers-in-england-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"NHS dentist numbers in England at lowest level in a decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/23/nhs-dentist-numbers-in-england-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/23/nhs-dentist-numbers-in-england-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade","fields":{"headline":"NHS dentist numbers in England at lowest level in a decade","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak is under pressure over his claims about the state of dentistry as figures reveal that the number of active NHS dentists in England is at its lowest level in a decade, leaving millions of people struggling to get checkups or have toothaches fixed. The British Dental Association (BDA) has warned of an exodus of dentists from the NHS as it published figures showing that the workforce has been reduced to a level not seen since 2012-13. Sunak has repeatedly said that 500 extra dentists had been recorded as providing NHS services in the 2021-22 financial year. A growing number of dental surgeries do little or no NHS-funded work, with the BDA citing a £3bn dental budget that has failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth over the past decade. A total of 23,577 dentists performed NHS work in the 2022-23 financial year, down 695 on the previous year, according to a response to a freedom of information request from the NHS Business Services Authority. That figure is more than 1,100 down on the pre-pandemic numbers. The loss of dentists within the system has led to nearly 6 million adults trying and failing to get an NHS dentist appointment in the past two years, according to a recent analysis by the BDA. The official figures on the NHS dentistry workforce appear to contradict the prime minister’s claims that recent reforms have boosted numbers. The BDA said it thought the prime minister was relying on a rise in activity from dentists in the NHS in the financial year 2021-22 that had naturally followed the end of the Covid lockdown. Shawn Charlwood, who chairs the British Dental Association’s general dental practice committee, said: “[The] government needs to drop the spin, accept the facts, and provide a rescue package to keep this service afloat. NHS dentistry is haemorrhaging talent, and further tweaks to a broken system will not stem the flow. “The prime minister once called for this budget to be ringfenced. We face an access crisis, and with hundreds of millions set to be pulled away, funds must be put to work solving these problems. “Ministers have a choice. They can help thousands of struggling practices fill vacancies and see patients, or just pass by on the other side.” The BDA has been asking ministers to recycle money returned to the government by dentistry practices that have been unable to hit their contractual targets. It is estimated this could exceed £400m this year. The fall in workforce numbers highlighted in the figures is also said by the BDA to underplay the full scale of lost capacity in NHS dentistry. A recent BDA survey of dentists in England revealed that half of dentists (50.3%) had reduced the proportion of NHS work they did by more than a quarter since the start of the pandemic. And 74% indicated that they planned to reduce the amount of NHS work they undertake in the year ahead. The NHS Business Services Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the latest figures might be lower than the previous year due to not all NHS dentists having submitted their data for the last financial year. She said: “We are working to improve access to NHS dental care and have already increased the funding practices receive for high-needs patients to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments. “We have also amended the guidelines so dental therapists and hygienists can deliver more treatments as well as making it easier to recruit dentists from overseas, and we will be setting out further measures to improve access shortly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/23/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-truth-integrity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"We know Boris Johnson is a liar but Rishi Sunak promised truth and integrity.

Where is it?","bodyText":"For all Rishi Sunak’s claims to be a trustworthy prime minister, he is, in fact, in the mould of Boris Johnson. He has made misleading claims from the start of his premiership, and continues to do so. Take his first prime minister’s questions on 26 October last year. To murmurs of approval from Conservative MPs, he told Labour’s Richard Burgon: “We will always support our hardworking nurses.” To drive home his support, Sunak added: “That is why, when I was chancellor, we reintroduced the nurses’ bursary.” This was a misleading claim, as the new prime minister would have been well aware. It is true that, as chancellor, Sunak offered a new educational grant of £5,000 a year (increasing to £8,000 in some cases) for all nursing students on courses from September 2020. However, this fell significantly short of the bursary system, which had earlier been scrapped by the Conservative government. It then got worse. In the same PMQs, Sunak told MPs that there had been “a record number of new homes built in the last year”. This claim was false. As a report by the due diligence website Full Fact later concluded: “The most recent published data shows 173,520 new homes were completed in England in the year to June 2022, slightly down on the previous year.” This false claim quickly became an important test for Sunak. His predecessor, Boris Johnson, made scores of such boasts, leaving them on the Hansard record even after they’d been exposed as false. Had Sunak corrected his relatively minor mistakes, as both parliamentary convention and the ministerial code demands, he could have sent a powerful signal. By choosing not to do so, he begs the question: does he share Johnson’s contempt for integrity, even as he claims to lead a government of “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”? The following month, Sunak made another misleading claim in the House of Commons: “Let us remember one thing: we had the fastest vaccine rollout in the world because of our freedoms after leaving the European Union.” In fact, the UK’s vaccines were procured while still a member of the single market and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Further, the UK’s early rollout was secured by the use of regulation 174, an EU provision allowing member states to bypass the authorisation of the EMA and issue their own medicines. Sunak entered Downing Street on the back of a promise to bring an end to the apparent disregard for the truth that was a defining feature of the Johnson and Truss premierships. He launched his campaign for the Tory leadership with a pledge to “restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country”. But his claims regarding the truth do not bear serious interrogation. I assert this with confidence because I have been keeping a record of false claims uttered by British prime ministers ever since the Iraq war began in 2003. My file indicated that Tony Blair’s successors, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May, were relatively honest. This is not to say they were perfect. But they were certainly not habitual and shameless liars. All this changed the moment Boris Johnson walked into Downing Street in July 2019. Sunak has surprised me. In common with almost everyone else, I thought he would represent a reversion to traditional politics after the malign chaos of Johnson and Truss. But that has not been the case. Take the promise to “reduce debt”, one of Sunak’s five pledges at the start of 2023. Neither Sunak nor his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, plan to reduce debt, as the March budget statement made explicit. On the contrary, it appears they mean to increase it substantially, while telling voters the opposite. According to the latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility, net debt stood at £2.5tn at the time of the budget, and is projected to rise every year till 2028, by which time it will have advanced to £2.9tn. Sunak should be all too familiar with these numbers. One former Conservative party communications expert told me that reducing debt “sounded better to voters”. Sunak’s apparent readiness to mislead on such issues could send a message to cabinet subordinates to follow suit. The biggest culprit is the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who seems to operate in a post-truth world: denying that Brexit is to blame for Dover delays, and making inflammatory claims about Pakistani “grooming gangs” that have been proved false by her own officials. The controversy over her speeding fine is the latest test of Sunak’s frequently broken promise to bring integrity back to government. At the G20 summit in Bali, Sunak was asked whether leaving the EU had contributed to Britain’s economic woes. The prime minister responded by talking about the global context, Covid and the war in Ukraine, but not Brexit. This strategy is known to lawyers as suppressio veri (the misrepresenting of the truth by withholding of relevant facts). During international trade week last November, Michael Gove boasted on Twitter: “We’ve secured new free trade deals with over 70 countries since 2016. That’s over £800bn worth of new global trade.” His statement was not correct. Robert Chote, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, has since stated that “it is misleading to describe the £800bn figure as a measure of ‘new global trade’ resulting from the recent deals.” The health secretary, Steve Barclay, is one of a number of ministers who have made the wild claim that accepting public sector pay demands would cost £1,000 per household. Leading the way in this was Sunak, who appeared in front of an RAF base in Lincolnshire to announce: “What I’m not going to do is ask ordinary families up and down the country to pay an extra £1,000 a year to meet the pay demands of the union bosses.” This prime ministerial claptrap has since been magisterially demolished by Chote. It’s as if Sunak and his ministers don’t respect facts at all. Or take the environment. Sunak said that “I care about the climate and the environment I’m leaving [my daughters].” His Downing Street spokesman insisted that Britain is “committed to net zero”. Yet as prime minister he has ejected the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, and the climate minister, Graham Stuart, from the cabinet. He almost did not attend Cop27 and advised King Charles against attending. He is pressing ahead with the opening of a new coalmine in Cumbria. There’s a further category of misleading or false comments from Sunak: tactical. The Tories are determined to turn Keir Starmer’s role as lieutenant to Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 general election into a liability. This may explain why the prime minister asserted during PMQs late last year that Corbyn’s national security agenda involved “abolishing our armed forces, scrapping the nuclear deterrent, withdrawing from Nato, voting against every single anti-terror law we tried, and befriending Hamas and Hezbollah”. Labour’s 2019 election manifesto proposed none of the above. Sunak has not corrected these false statements, despite being asked to do so by Jeremy Corbyn. Note, however, that Starmer also emerges poorly from this exchange: the opposition leader did not correct Sunak. Britain therefore has a monstrous problem. Before Sunak turned up in Downing Street, it was just about possible to explain the collapse of integrity after 2019 in terms of Johnson’s incorrigible personal dishonesty. But Sunak appears to be yet another compulsively dishonest prime minister. This suggests a deep-rooted structural problem not just in the Conservative party but also in the House of Commons. Hence the importance of the ongoing House of Commons privileges committee investigation into allegations that Boris Johnson misled parliament about parties held in Downing Street during lockdown. The committee cannot reach a conclusion about Johnson without making a wider judgment about whether a prime minister should be permitted to mislead the Commons. So the question will arise: what about Sunak? Sunak’s pledge to bring back trust in British politics, reasserted so many times, appears itself to be insincere. This brings personal discredit, makes good government impossible and demonstrates how deeply political deceit has become embedded in our national life. Something has gone horribly wrong with the British system of government.

The figures come against a backdrop of private rents in the UK hitting record highs, and days after the government announced a shake-up of the sector to tackle the “injustices” that many tenants are facing. The debt charity StepChange, which issued the polling data, said that “with so many renters in financial difficulty”, stronger protections for those who fell behind with their rent were required or else people would be left vulnerable to “hair-trigger eviction”. It said that while the renters’ reform bill announced last Wednesday was welcome, it did not go far enough, as many financially and otherwise vulnerable tenants faced challenges that would not be addressed by the proposals. The private rented sector was now “unaffordable, inaccessible and insecure for those on the lowest incomes, leaving them at high risk of problem debt, poor mental and physical health and prolonged housing insecurity,” the charity said as it issued a report. It also published a YouGov poll showing that 15% of private renters – 1.1 million people as of this month – were in problem debt, compared with 8% of the general population. The charity added that this number had risen “sharply” – by more than a third – since January, when it stood at an estimated 800,000 people, or 11% of private renters. Signs of financial difficulty include using credit, loans or an overdraft to make it through to payday, falling behind on essential household bills, using credit to keep up with existing credit commitments, and getting hit by late payment or default charges, said StepChange, with those in severe problem debt typically displaying three or more of those signs. The research also found that half of all private renters – about 3.7 million people – had had their rent increased in the last 12 months, while more than 1.2 million said they were using credit to make ends meet. Many have described the private rented sector as being in crisis, which Michael Gove, the housing secretary, appeared to acknowledge last week when he said: “Too many renters are living in damp, unsafe, cold homes, powerless to put things right, and with the threat of sudden eviction hanging over them.” The number of households renting in England more than doubled between 2001 and 2021, the latest census revealed, and a string of surveys have indicated that typical private rents have hit new highs. Earlier this month the estate agent Hamptons said tenants in Great Britain were now typically paying 25% more than they were at the start of the Covid pandemic. Meanwhile, experts say severe shortages of rental properties have led to intense competition for what is available, with queues for viewings, desperate renters paying over the odds, and some landlords insisting on a year’s rent in advance. StepChange’s report stated that one in five private renters who had tried to find a new home in the last 12 months said they were asked to pay more than two months’ rent in advance. More than half were asked to bid on the property they were trying to rent, and only 28% were successful, it added. The charity’s client survey found private renters “struggled with the affordability of their homes more than any other housing tenure”. Average monthly private rent payments were found to be almost double those in the social sector, and 39% more than average mortgage payments. The reforms outlined by the government last week will ban no-fault evictions but also strengthen landlords’ rights to throw out tenants for antisocial behaviour. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said at the time that, as a result of its package, 11 million tenants across England would “benefit from safer, fairer and higher-quality homes thanks to a once-in-a-generation overhaul of housing laws”. The department was approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2023/may/23/approach-to-tackling-violence-raises-concern-among-nhs-england-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Approach to tackling violence raises concern among NHS England staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/23/approach-to-tackling-violence-raises-concern-among-nhs-england-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/23/approach-to-tackling-violence-raises-concern-among-nhs-england-staff","fields":{"headline":"Approach to tackling violence raises concern among NHS England staff","bodyText":"There has long been an acknowledgment by ministers and NHS leaders that violence against staff by patients was an issue that needed addressing, with a strategy to tackle it announced nearly five years ago. The health service’s 2019 long-term plan included a pilot for the use of body-worn cameras by paramedics in a bid to “de-escalate” situations. The following year the Crown Prosecution Service announced an agreement with the police and NHS England to “secure swift prosecutions” of those who assault staff, and the maximum penalty for assaulting emergency workers, including doctors and nurses, was also doubled to two years. Despite these measures, there have been internal disagreements within NHS England about the best approach to the problem, which affected almost 15% of staff last year, according to the latest national survey of the health service workforce. The Guardian understands that senior managers in NHS England told staff in its violence prevention and reduction (VPR) team last April that prosecutions of those who assaulted healthcare workers and dismissals of abusive staff should be a last resort. Instead, the focus should be on improving the culture of the NHS and staff wellbeing. It is also understood that managers cautioned against using the term “zero tolerance” because they said it did not take into account that some people who abuse NHS staff might lack capacity, an apparent reference to mentally ill patients. A number of staff in NHS England’s violence prevention and reduction team warned that moving away from prosecution was dangerous, the Guardian understands, given the risk posed by violent and sexual offenders. A spokesperson from NHS England denied there had been any change in approach and said stressed police were responsible for the prosecution of any perpetrators. The Guardian has been told the VPR team, which used to number 12 in 2021, will be cut to two next year under a major restructure of NHS England. It is also understood that the VPR team no longer provides advice and support to Operation Cavell, an initiative first set up in Sussex in 2016 to increase convictions of people who assault frontline healthcare staff, which is also being piloted by police forces and NHS trusts in London, Hampshire and Wiltshire. Although the scheme still exists, an NHS England insider said the operation had been deprioritised, because of a feeling among senior management that the focus on prosecution was unhelpful. A three-month pilot scheme of Operation Cavell in five London boroughs, Lambeth, Southwark, Bromley, Croydon and Sutton, between October 2020 and January 2021, recorded an increase in charges, according to a CPS press release. But none of the Operation Cavell pilots in England have since published further data on prosecution or convictions rates. Penelope Gibbs, director of Transform Justice, said their research on violence against healthcare staff and the police, which examined the project, found that there was no evidence that harsher sanctions deter assaults on emergency workers. A presentation on Operation Cavell in Sussex, first given in 2018, highlighted a range of problems that initially prevented it from working, including disagreements between police and NHS staff over how to handle incidents of abuse by mentally ill patients. Supt Richard Bates, Sussex police’s lead on Operation Cavell, said reliable data on its impact was not available. He added that the scheme was not just about increasing prosecutions, and the force had helped Sussex partnership NHS foundation trust develop informal responses to low-level incidents, including warning letters and acceptable behaviour contracts. An NHS England spokesperson said it was already reviewing how it supported the health service to tackle sexual misconduct in the workplace. He added: “This work does not include any formal role in Operation Cavell. But NHS England continues to work with the government and other partners to ensure the NHS is a safe space for staff and patients; local services must not tolerate sexual misconduct, violence, harassment, or abuse – it is totally unacceptable.” Additional reporting by Anna Bawden"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/23/nhs-staff-report-20000-claims-of-patient-sexual-misconduct-over-five-years","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"NHS staff report 20,000 claims of patient sexual misconduct over five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/23/nhs-staff-report-20000-claims-of-patient-sexual-misconduct-over-five-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/23/nhs-staff-report-20000-claims-of-patient-sexual-misconduct-over-five-years","fields":{"headline":"NHS staff report 20,000 claims of patient sexual misconduct over five years","bodyText":"Thousands of hospital staff are reporting claims of sexual assaults and harassment by patients, an investigation has found, prompting calls for ministers to address the “daily threat of abuse” faced by doctors and nurses. More than 20,000 alleged incidents of sexual violence and sexual misconduct by patients on hospital staff were recorded in the five years to 2022 by 212 NHS trusts in England, freedom of information (FoI) requests by the Guardian and the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found. The 20,928 cases accounted for just under 60% of the total alleged incidents trusts disclosed. Allegations included claims of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking and sexualised remarks. Experts cautioned that the figures were likely to be a serious underestimate as staff are often deterred from making complaints when patients abuse them. Deeba Syed, a senior legal officer at the Rights of Women helpline, said: “Women tell us they are expected to continue to care for patients who are abusive or harassing without efforts to adequately safeguard them from further harassment. “We hear worrying reports of women feeling pressured into not raising formal grievances and instead being transferred to different departments or locations. They tell us it is argued that this is more expedient than moving the harassing patient, despite victims feeling this is unsafe to others and a punishment on them.” Katie, not her real name, a junior doctor in the south-east of England, said patients had made sexual comments about her since she was a student. “From the word go within clinical placement, I always felt very heavily sexualised by patients,” she said. “One time, when I had to get close up to a patient’s face to examine his eyes, the patient started licking his lips and rubbing himself. I was 19 or 20 at the time and the consultant had left the room – I was completely terrified.” She said she has also experienced sinister, crude comments, like being asked if she was going to “pleasure” a male patient. Katie said she did not feel she could tell anyone as she found most of the consultants intimidating. The everyday harassment has made her reevaluate her career path and she is hoping to go into obstetrics and gynaecology so she does not have to treat men. “I find the sexual harassment affects me too much and makes me feel like shit.” The Guardian and BMJ investigation found trusts recorded 35,606 sexual safety incidents, a term that covers a spectrum of behaviours from abusive remarks to rape, allegedly perpetrated by staff, patients or visitors in NHS hospitals in England between 2017 and 2022. While the majority were cases of patient-on-staff abuse, nearly 7,500 were allegations of patients abusing other patients and more than 3,000 were cases of staff abusing patients. Responding to the findings, Simon Fleming, an orthopaedic surgeon and co-author of a 2021 report on sexual assault in surgery for the Royal College of Surgeons, said the NHS needed to take a more robust approach to sexual misconduct by patients. He said: “Patients abuse staff often. Some of this is normalised, some of it less so. What you permit, you promote, and the NHS needs to stop permitting patients and staff behaving in a way that makes healthcare less safe for all of us.” Some NHS workers do feel able to speak out. Charlotte Miller, a paramedic at Westminster ambulance station, London, said her employers were “incredible” when she reported being molested while attending to a patient on Edgware Road, west London, in October 2022. The patient, Naveed Ahmed, in his mid-30s, was jailed for nine months in November 2022. Miller said: “He had already told my crewmate and I we were sexy and had been leering at us, but then he grabbed my crotch. I was really shocked. I’ve had comments before, but that was the first time that someone actively tried to grope me. I didn’t know what he was going to do next.” As soon as she radioed for help, the police were called and her station sent a colleague, along with an incident response officer. “I had all these phone calls from various managers to make sure I was OK, they told me to have the rest of my shift off and go home to rest. They constantly checked in on me in the days afterwards and helped support me while I made my statements to the police. I couldn’t ask for any better management, if I’m honest. “I hope this will encourage other people to have the confidence to report these things,” she said. Dr Becky Cox, a co-founder of Surviving in Scrubs, said: “The stark findings of this investigation should put into sharp focus the work that the health secretary and NHS leaders need to do to ensure the freedom of NHS staff to work without threat of sexual violence from patients and other staff members. “It was not long ago we were being heralded as pandemic heroes by the government and cheered by the general public, yet we continue to face unsafe working conditions and the daily threat of abuse.” Surviving in Scrubs lists more than 150 personal accounts of sexual harassment and abuse. They include cases of patients assaulting, molesting and sexualising nurses and doctors. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, said: “NHS leaders have a statutory duty of care to look after their staff and patients and prevent harassment, abuse or violence in the workplace. I expect employers to be proactive in ensuring staff and patients are fully supported, their concerns listened to and acted on with appropriate action taken where necessary.” Dr Navina Evans, the chief workforce officer at NHS England, said the health service should not tolerate any sexual misconduct, violence, harassment or abuse. “NHS England has established a dedicated team to ensure people who experience violence and abuse are supported in the workplace, and there is greater provision of support for all victims and survivors. All NHS trusts and organisations have measures in place to ensure immediate action is taken in any cases reported to them and I strongly encourage anyone who has experienced any misconduct to come forward, report it and seek support.” • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

An investigation by the Guardian and the British Medical Journal found more than 35,606 “sexual safety incidents” were recorded by NHS hospitals in England over the past five years. The term covers a spectrum of allegations, from abusive remarks to rape, allegedly perpetrated by staff, patients and visitors. Responses to freedom of information requests from 212 NHS trusts found that 22 each recorded more than 500 alleged incidents over 2017-2022, including seven with between 1,000 and 2,000. But according to the data released, 59 trusts recorded 20 or fewer incidents, of which 41 recorded between zero and 10. Experts said such low numbers appeared to be highly improbable, given the huge numbers of patients treated and staff employed. Of the cases that were disclosed, 20,928 were incidents in which patients abused staff. Nearly 7,500 were cases of patients abusing other patients and more than 3,000 were cases of staff abusing patients. Experts were particularly concerned that NHS trusts disclosed just 902 alleged incidents of sexual misconduct by staff against staff in a five-year period, equivalent to less than one case in each trust each year. A 2019 survey by Unison found that 8.1% of NHS staff had experienced sexual harassment at work during the past year, with more than three-quarters saying the perpetrator was a fellow staff member. Other research estimates the rate is much higher. Taking the most conservative estimates of prevalence, Dr Sarah Steele, a senior researcher at Cambridge University, said with more than 1 million staff employed by the 212 NHS trusts, she would have expected them to have recorded many more incidents of sexual misconduct. “Based on past self-reporting figures in surveys by health unions and others, we would expect more than 120,000 cases of sexual misconduct per year at NHS trusts in England where the victim is a staff member, of which 90,000-95,000 would be staff-on-staff,” said Steele. This suggests that at least 100,000 alleged incidents against staff a year are not captured in the annual figures that NHS trusts declared in their FoI responses. “While some people would never report sexual harassment or abuse to their employer and there is a hidden figure of sexual misconduct, such low numbers suggest extremely worrying under-reporting,” said Steele. “It is clear many staff either don’t feel able or don’t know how to report incidents involving their colleagues.” Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist at University hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS foundation trust and a former president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) trade union, said: “I was sexually assaulted in front of everyone early in my career, but when I raised it internally at that time, they said: ‘You could report, but you do realise you would be known as the person who got a senior consultant sacked?’, so I didn’t take it any further. Because I never went to the police, there’s no record of it having happened. In my HCSA role, I’ve seen that many trusts only pay lip service to sexual safety.” An analysis of the FoI responses showed that while all trusts have policies that govern behaviour at work, fewer than 10% of respondents had standalone sexual safety policies, which contain specific measures to protect patients, visitors and staff from sexual violence and misconduct and set out what processes to follow when cases are reported. Only one of the NHS trusts that recorded zero or few incidents had a dedicated sexual safety policy. In contrast, those that had a specific policy tended to record far more cases. Research published earlier this month by the University of Cambridge showed that only one NHS trust in England provides dedicated training to prevent sexual harassment. Police figures show 11,880 alleged sexual crimes on NHS premises in the past five years, with the vast majority alleged to have taken place in hospitals. FoI responses from 37 police forces in England list 3,084 rapes, including 56 gang rapes, and 5,164 sexual assaults. Forces did not consistently provide a breakdown of who the alleged perpetrator was. These include 493 alleged child sexual offences in hospitals, mental health units and GP surgeries in England recorded by 32 police forces, with at least 171 alleged victims aged under 13. The alleged offences include 180 alleged rapes of children under 16, of which four were gang rapes, 186 sexual assaults of children under 16, and 127 other child sexual offences, including grooming, assaulting a child by penetration, sexual communication with a child, inciting sexual activity with a child, and causing a child to watch a sex act. Responding to the findings, medical colleges and health unions demanded immediate action. The BMA called on the government to “urgently produce a plan of action to protect our colleagues”, while the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the HCSA, which represents hospital doctors, the GMB union, the Society of Radiographers, the British Dietetic Association, and the Liberal Democrats called for a full independent inquiry into sexual assault and harassment in the NHS. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, said: “NHS leaders have a statutory duty of care to look after their staff and patients and prevent harassment, abuse or violence in the workplace. I expect employers to be proactive in ensuring staff and patients are fully supported, their concerns listened to and acted on, with appropriate action taken where necessary.” An NHS spokesperson said sexual misconduct was “totally unacceptable”, adding: “NHS England is already reviewing how it supports the health service to develop policies, education, and training to tackle sexual misconduct in the workplace and better support staff. This includes building on the work of the government’s women’s health strategy.” Sexual abuse in the NHS: what data is there? The full extent of allegations of sexual violence and sexual misconduct in the health service – by staff, patients and visitors – is difficult to gauge due to gaps and inconsistencies in the way the NHS and the police record alleged incidents. Although NHS England compiles figures on reports of physical abuse of patients in NHS trusts, it does not specifically collate numbers on sexual abuse, or on the abuse of staff. NHS trusts record sexual safety incidents, a term which covers a spectrum of behaviours from abusive remarks to rape. However, while some trusts recorded sexual violence and sexual misconduct, others said they did not record sexual misconduct and could only provide data on the most “serious” incidents. One trust said it had 3,000 verbal incidents but could not identify how many were sexual. Several trusts did not disclose the number of incidents allegedly perpetrated by staff, both where the complainants were patients and staff, due to gaps in their records. A significant number of trusts said they did not record figures on incidents allegedly perpetrated by visitors, although the Lampard report into the abuse by the late BBC DJ Jimmy Savile raised concern that this poses a potential risk to patients, their visitors and staff. The total number of alleged child sexual offences is also difficult to discover because of inconsistencies in the way these claims are recorded by the police. For example, some claims of crimes against children aged 13-15 are recorded under the category for victims aged 13 and above, which also covers alleged crimes against adults. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

I was going to die’: Alex Messenger’s ordeal in the wilderness","bodyText":"Late one afternoon, on what was supposed to be a six-week white-water canoe trip through the Canadian wilderness, 17-year-old Alex Messenger left his campsite to climb a steep ridge that promised panoramic views of the tundra. It was the highest point for at least 50 miles. “You could see lake after lake, after lake,” he says. Then, directly across the ridge, Messenger saw something else – a flicker of brown. His body recognised it before his conscious mind did. “It triggered all of the physiological responses in a fraction of a second,” he says, “before I even realised it was a grizzly bear.” Four weeks earlier, in July 2005, Messenger’s group of six had set out on their summer adventure from Lake Wholdaia, in the remote Canadian Northwest Territories. They had been told that they would be lucky even to see a bear. “I felt like I had a good appreciation of what risks we were likely to encounter,” Messenger says. “Top of my mind was flipping the boat, and other things that can happen in white water.” Finding himself face to face with a 600lb grizzly bear had not crossed his mind. Now, with the predator just 30ft away, Messenger felt his airways enlarge, his adrenaline spike and his pulse double, preparing his body to flee, fight or hide. The bear seemed to be making a similarly rapid assessment. It was on all fours, wide-eyed and clearly startled. “It was like we’d stumbled upon each other, and both had the reaction: ‘What am I looking at?’” says Messenger. Messenger wanted to run. Instead, he says, “I fell back on my training.” He started slowly backing away, speaking in a low voice, keeping his eyes averted, trying desperately to persuade the bear that he was not to be feared. But the bear wasn’t convinced. Grunting and growling, it launched towards Messenger, one or two steps at a time, as if it was testing him. The distance between them was shrinking rapidly, even as Messenger was edging away. “I knew that I couldn’t run – but I wasn’t really sure what to do at that point,” he says (the bear deterrents the group had packed were back at the campsite). Then the bear charged. Despite their immense bulk, bears can run at close to 40mph. When it was 15ft away, Messenger could feel the ground shaking under its paws. He yelled for help, knowing that no one could hear him. Then, instinctively, he threw his 15lb camera case at the animal galloping towards him – and hit it square on its snout. The strike was forceful enough to turn the bear’s head, allowing Messenger to jump out of its path. “As soon as it realised that it had missed me, it turned around and came at me again.” Even in the moment, he remembers being struck by its agility. “I’ve never seen anything move as quickly as that bear.” The other thing that registered above his terror was the smell – “like a dog that had never been bathed”. For excruciating seconds, bear and boy circled each other, “bullfighting style”, says Messenger – but with each round, the circle grew tighter. The bear was snapping and swiping at Messenger, who took a glancing blow to the shoulder, then another across his back. But, just as he had dodged its jaws, the bear reached up with its forepaws. The blow across Messenger’s face could have felled a caribou or musk ox, the bear’s typical prey. “I felt like a mosquito getting swatted,” he says. “My head went to the side, then I went flying.” Mid-air, he realised there was no way that he could outsmart or outmanoeuvre his opponent. “There was nothing physically that I could do: you’ve got a 150lb 17-year-old versus a 600lb grizzly bear,” he says. “I just realised that, you know … I was about to die.” He pauses. “And it was a terrible feeling.” As soon as Messenger landed, hard, on his tailbone, the bear was upon him. Its head was right above his hip joint, its jaws around his leg. “I felt those teeth go in on both sides, and blacked out from the pain,” he says. He doesn’t know how long he was unconscious: “I was playing dead very effectively.” When he came to, the bear was loping quickly in the other direction. Having eliminated the threat, it seemingly wanted to make a quick getaway. Still playing dead, Messenger watched it disappear over the edge of the rise, then took his chance. He set out in what he hoped was the direction of the camp, his surging adrenaline just about overpowering the growing heat of his right thigh. “The whole time I was waiting for the bear to come back and finish the job,” he says. He staggered 150 yards or so to the lip of the ridge, his right leg now screaming, his trouser leg sticky with blood, and yelled down to the campsite: “Bear!” Below, his friends reacted with disbelief. They were in a bug-proof communal tent, making pizzas for dinner. Messenger had been unlucky to run into the bear and even less lucky to be attacked by it. Just 44 attacks by grizzly bears are reported globally each year, with 12 of them taking place in North America. Most are nonfatal. He estimates now, on a video call from his home in Duluth, Minnesota, that the time between stumbling across the bear and losing consciousness was 30-60 seconds. “It was super-short, but it had ripple effects through the rest of my life,” he says. Lying there on the hill, powerful images of loved ones flashed through his mind in quick succession. The group’s 27-year-old guide, Dan, had some emergency responder training and he carried out an initial assessment. Messenger’s right leg had been in the bear’s jaws, causing a deep puncture to his thigh and four more compression wounds elsewhere. He had claw marks across his back, around one ankle and to an earlobe, and the beginnings of a black eye where the bear had struck him. At some point, the tips of two of his toes had been sliced clean off: he has no recollection of how that happened. The group was more than 100 miles from the closest settlement – but, after their base camp was consulted via satellite phone, an emergency evacuation by plane was deemed too logistically challenging. While Messenger could not walk, he could paddle, so the group resolved to continue along the route towards what had been their intended destination, the tiny settlement of Baker Lake in the Arctic territory of Nunavut, remaining in close contact with experts by phone and monitoring Messenger day and night for signs of infection. Damage to Messenger’s muscle tissue had slowed the flow of blood to his wounds and Dan was tasked with regularly reopening his wounds and flushing them by syringe. Messenger recalls the excruciating pain, and biting down on his leather-covered multitool to cope. The group’s stores of ibuprofen had to be carefully rationed, but for Messenger there was some comfort in putting his fate in the hands of his teammates. “It can be hard to let go, but I think it’s a really important step … It helps to bring some peace and remove stress.” With Messenger only able to paddle with reduced mobility, and sometimes having to encounter white water, the group made slow and often painful progress. But, he says, being able to contribute was a “really good feeling”. “That I was able to assist in my own rescue was empowering and cathartic for me … I had this mindset of ‘OK, what do we have to do next?’” As long as Messenger remained stable, the priority was getting him a rabies shot within 12 days of the attack. But, after a gruelling five-day passage, his wounds started showing signs of infection. Dan improvised his first-ever surgery, cutting out the dying tissue – “like trying to cut through the tough parts of raw chicken”, says Messenger. Nevertheless, the infection continued to spread. Now that they were closer to the settlement at Baker Lake and helicopters were available, the call was made to evacuate the patient. It was decided that one of the teammates, Mike, would accompany Messenger on his journey, because it was thought that he was less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if he stayed with someone he knew. Ironically, Messenger recalls, Mike was the one who had persuaded him to come on the trip, when he had been wavering over the cost. “I’m still thankful that he did,” he says. “Really – it was just such an amazing experience, even if it didn’t quite go as we planned.” At Baker Lake, Messenger received 12 hours of intravenous antibiotics, before being flown south to Winnipeg for the first of five rabies shots. His parents drove through the night from the family home in Minnesota to pick him up. For six weeks, he took oral antibiotics and followed a programme of wound care management. Two months after the attack, the puncture on his right thigh had healed. He regained full motion a year later through personal training. “I was incredibly lucky,” he says. “To see me, no one would have any idea what had happened.” That has proved its own burden. There is no support group for survivors of bear attacks, because, as Messenger says, there aren’t enough of them. “I recognised pretty early on that it would be hard to find people who would relate.” Even before they were evacuated, Messenger had told Mike that he almost wished for claw marks on his arm, some sign of what he’d been through. “It’s like this impostor syndrome: people are going to think that I’m making it up.” When most people hear about Messenger’s story, he says, their first reaction is to look him up and down. The toll proved to be mostly psychological. For the first few weeks after the attack, Messenger had flashbacks and would wake up in the night, convinced a bear was right next to him. Even almost 20 years later, Messenger, who is now 35, remains easily startled. When he is out hiking, and a twig snaps, “I instantly go into a full-blown fight-or-flight response”. Dogs in particular can be triggering. But, through meditation and breathwork, he has been able to gain greater control over those bodily responses. Learning about bears and why they attack also helped him to process the trauma. “When you have a trauma, regardless of what it is, if you’re able to understand it, that can be a big step towards healing,” he says. “It’s taking this thing that your brain can’t figure out and compartmentalising it, so that it’s not just going to jump out at you.” Messenger also drew comfort from researching what he could have done differently, in case he should ever be unlucky enough to stumble across a bear again. “It’s things as simple as not going out alone, and making a noise when you’re coming up to a blind spot, that are going to dramatically decrease the chances of this happening again.” A few years ago, he returned to grizzly country, visiting the Glacier National Park in Montana with friends. They carried bear spray – “religiously”, he says. Today, Messenger talks knowledgeably about bear behaviour in a way that belies his first-hand experience. His only response while watching Leonardo DiCaprio’s character get mauled by a bear in the 2015 film The Revenant was to think: “That bear is not moving like my bear did.” Messenger’s was a “classic defensive encounter,” he says, meaning that the bear was motivated only by the desire to eliminate threat, not by the need for food – which, he says, would be what is known as a “predacious encounter – and a whole other level of horrifying”. But, although Messenger might have mastered intellectually, what happened to him, for some years he struggled to find the meaning of it. “I’ve always felt that there’s perhaps some kind of purpose tied around this whole experience. I don’t know what that is, but it feels like there was a little bit more at play than what we can see and touch.” For years, “I was waiting for an ‘Aha!’ moment that would tie it all up for me,” he says. “That never happened.” Eventually, he joined his local volunteer wilderness search-and-rescue team, using his experience to help others. Writing a book about his experience was also therapeutic: “I realised I could spend my entire life waiting to find out what the purpose was – it was time to tell the story. I didn’t need to tell people what it meant: they could take their own meaning from it.” In his day-by-day account of the journey, Messenger carries the reader along with him to replicate a singular experience that can transform a life. “Everything changes once you get there – and everything changes once you leave.” The Twenty-Ninth Day: Surviving a Grizzly Attack in the Canadian Tundra by Alex Messenger is out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/23/tv-tonight-a-beautifully-animated-story-about-taliban-era-afghanistan","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: a beautifully animated story about Taliban-era Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/23/tv-tonight-a-beautifully-animated-story-about-taliban-era-afghanistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/23/tv-tonight-a-beautifully-animated-story-about-taliban-era-afghanistan","fields":{"headline":"TV tonight: a beautifully animated story about Taliban-era Afghanistan","bodyText":"Storyville: Inside Kabul 10pm, BBC Four Raha and Marwa are two young women who, when the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, exchanged voice notes about their separate journeys.

The Ivory Act, passed in 2018, targeted materials from elephants, but a loophole meant that animals other than elephants, including hippos, were being targeted for their ivory. After a consultation, ministers have decided to tighten the ban to include all ivory-bearing species, so these will not be poached to fill the gap in the trade left by the elephant ivory ban. Ministers said the hippopotamus was the species most at risk from the trade in its ivory after elephants, and the other species were already threatened by the climate crisis. They added that continued trade in their ivory could exacerbate these threats and make their long-term survival less likely. The elephant ivory ban faced immense challenges, with antique traders taking the government to court in an ultimately unsuccessful battle to squash the legislation. Trudy Harrison, biodiversity minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: “This is a pivotal moment in delivering one of our key manifesto commitments on international conservation. “The Ivory Act is one of the toughest bans of its kind in the world and by extending greater legal protections to five more species, we are sending a clear message the commercial trade of ivory is totally unacceptable. “The UK has long led the way in conservation and our ban shows continued global leadership in doing all we can to protect the world’s most endangered species.” Ivory is used for ornaments, musical instruments and jewellery, among other items, and animals are poached across the globe for profit in what can be a lucrative market. The hard, white material comes from the tusks and teeth of animals. It consists mainly of dentine, one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks. Charities welcomed the ban. Frances Goodrum, head of campaigns and programmes at the International Fund for Animal Welfare UK, said: “[We] are encouraged by early indications that the ban is having a significant impact on the trade in elephant ivory, yet other species are still poached globally to meet an unnecessary demand for ‘luxury’ ivory products, including the hippopotamus, walrus, narwhal, sperm whale and killer whale. “We welcome Defra’s decision to extend this powerful legislation, which will go a long way in cracking down on a damaging trade. Today is a good day for conservation and a step change towards international commitments to safeguard our natural world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/may/23/we-give-our-blood-so-they-live-comfortably-sri-lankas-tea-pickers-say-they-go-hungry-and-live-in-squalor","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"‘We give our blood so they live comfortably’: Sri Lanka’s tea pickers say they go hungry and live in squalor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/23/we-give-our-blood-so-they-live-comfortably-sri-lankas-tea-pickers-say-they-go-hungry-and-live-in-squalor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/may/23/we-give-our-blood-so-they-live-comfortably-sri-lankas-tea-pickers-say-they-go-hungry-and-live-in-squalor","fields":{"headline":"‘We give our blood so they live comfortably’: Sri Lanka’s tea pickers say they go hungry and live in squalor","bodyText":"Some of the world’s leading tea manufacturers, including Tetley and Lipton, are examining working conditions on the plantations of its Sri Lankan suppliers, following a Guardian investigation. Two global trade-certification schemes, Fairtrade and the Rainforest Alliance, are also conducting inquiries after it was revealed that some workers on 10 certified estates could not afford to eat and were living in squalid conditions. Tea pickers claim that estate owners failed to support them during the country’s unprecedented economic crisis, which has seen prices of food, fuel and medicine soar, without wages rising to match. The pickers reported supervisors refusing to pay them what they were owed and incidences of verbal abuse. Some of the pickers said they had so little money that they were having to skip meals and felt forced to send their children to work. Tetley said it had suspended work with some central Sri Lankan estates while it conducted its own inquiries. Ekaterra, which owns Lipton and PG Tips, said it was in contact with the Rainforest Alliance over the findings. Yorkshire Tea, another company that sources tea from the estates the Guardian visited, said it was speaking to the plantations concerned. More than 300,000 people work in Sri Lanka’s tea plantations, which are mainly in the mountainous Central Highlands. In 2022, the industry generated £1.079bn in exports. Tea pickers have been struggling since the country was plunged into an economic crisis after a disastrous ban on chemical fertilisers in 2021, which decimated tea yields and caused production to fall to a 26-year low last year. Workers must pick at least 18kg (40lb) a day to earn 1,000 Sri Lankan rupees (about £2.60/$3.25) – a fee set by the government’s wage board in 2021. If they pick less, they get a lower rate for each kilo. The depreciation of the rupee has caused the average daily wage in the sector to fall in real terms over the 24 months to February 2023 from £3.90 to £2.20. A bailout from the International Monetary Fund in March saw the figure bounce back slightly to about £2.60. But inflation, which hit an all-time high of 86% in September, has kept food prices high. In January, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 44% of families in tea estate areas were food insecure – twice the figure of urban districts. Workers claimed some estate supervisors have tried to underpay workers. Lakshman Devanayagie, 33, said: “Even if we pick good tea leaves, they will say it’s not good enough, and they will tip it out, or that they are going to cut our pay. “If we give them five kilos of tea leaves, they will only pay us for two or three. When we ask them, they say, ‘we’re doing as we’re told, so why don’t you do as you’re told?’,” she said, adding that she felt suicidal at times. Rangasamy Puwaneshkanthy lives with her husband and three children in the hills above one tea estate. She said has had to take out loans to pay for food and regularly missed meals, adding that she often chose to forgo buying sanitary towels so she could buy food for her children. “If there’s no food at home, then I don’t take any to work. I tell them [supervisors] I’m going home for a bit and then come back, because I can’t watch other people eating,” Puwaneshkanthy said. She said pressure to pick quickly meant that she did not have time to watch out for leeches, which are common in the damp climate. Last year, her leg became infected from one and she had to walk for an hour to see a doctor because she could not afford a rickshaw ride. “If we stop to pick the leech off, then we’ll be one kilo down – that’s how we’re thinking when we work,” said Puwaneshkanthy. “We don’t know what to do. We’re working on the estate, but we have no salary. What are we meant to do?” Another worker, Subramaniam Sathyavani, 40, said she felt dehumanised working on the estate. “We give our blood so the managers can live comfortably,” she said. The tea estates are run by companies that lease land from the government. Most workers are Malayaga Tamils, descendants of indentured labourers brought from southern India by British colonisers. Most still live in the tiny homes built by the British, which are now owned by the plantations. Some have no running water or toilets, and workers say they are forced to defecate in nearby rivers. One woman said her husband had died after drinking contaminated water. While they are not forced to stay on the plantations, there are few other job options in the area for the tea pickers, and many have limited education. The rural location means workers have little choice but to use amenities provided by the estate, such as childcare, the costs of which are deducted from their wages. The Guardian has seen a number of wage slips that showed monthly deductions of 50% or more. At least once last year, Puwaneshkanthy said, she was left with nothing at the end of the month after all her bills had been deducted. “If we work 22 or 23 days, because of all the cuts we only get about 15, 16 days’ worth of pay,” said Puwaneshkanthy, who in January left the estate to work 75 miles away as a housemaid in Colombo, where she can earn more money. Jeevan Thondaman, Sri Lanka’s minister for water and estate infrastructure, said the findings showed “exploitation in its finest form”. He said: “We have to find a way to expedite or accelerate this process of giving them decent work. And I have a feeling we can do that by involving international agencies [like the] UN, Flocert [a trade certification body] and Fairtrade.” Thondaman said some plantations had lied and had “bullshitted” to all these foreign organisations that they were “ethical” to get funding. He wants the government to break up the estates and lease land to workers to grow their own cash crops, giving them greater control. Fairtrade, which certified three of the plantations visited, said it had referred the Guardian’s allegations to its independent certifier, Flocert, and the Fairtrade protection committee, which oversees the safety of children and vulnerable adults. In a statement, it said plantations were obliged by the Fairtrade Standard for Hired Labour Organisations to adjust wages to keep pace with inflation. “Fairtrade takes allegations of worker mistreatment very seriously. Indeed, improving the livelihoods of workers in challenging regions is one of the reasons that Fairtrade was established,” it said. The Rainforest Alliance, which has certified nine estates, said it was “deeply concerned by the allegations”. “We take this matter very seriously and will be conducting our own investigations, as is our usual process,” said Madhuri Nanda, the alliance’s south Asia director. “These investigations will inform next steps and appropriate action, which could include suspension or cancellation of the certificates of the tea estates in question.” Lalith Obeyesekere, secretary general of the Planters’ Association of Ceylon, the body that represents the plantation companies that the Guardian visited, said claims that salary deductions left workers with no wages were “unsubstantiated”. Any deductions had to be authorised and not exceed 50% of a worker’s wage. He said employees could file grievances if they believed too much money had been deducted but no complaints had been reported by members. Obeyesekere said plantation workers got 14 days of paid holiday and 14 days’ sick leave a year, as well as bonuses, three months’ paid maternity leave, and free maternal and childcare until the child was five. Workers were also entitled to allowances of milk powder, flour and rice, and the children received free medicine and vaccinations. He said investments were being made to improve amenities, including housing, sanitation and hygiene facilities. He added that the industry was exploring all possible options to mitigate the worst effects of the economic crisis for employees and that increasing wages was a top priority for the association. However, its members could only pay employees out of revenues and was calling for an end to the current payment system. In August, Sri Lanka’s court of appeal dismissed a petition by plantation owners seeking to reverse the 2021 wage increase. Thondaman said he would lobby the wage board to increase pay. He also said new technology, such as digital weighing machines, which have already been installed on a few estates, should be rolled out more widely. However, Palani Digambaram, an MP from the National Union of Workers, who grew up on tea estates, said people were working as “slaves, without proper food or salaries”. “If there are no tea plantations, I’ll be happy. Do our people only have to work on tea plantations?” he said. “With leeches and snakes biting them, tigers and this and that coming, just having to pluck tea leaves, what will their life be like? Those women are suffering.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/23/outcry-as-world-health-organization-locks-out-taiwan-under-pressure-from-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T04:49:41Z","webTitle":"Outcry as World Health Organization locks out Taiwan under pressure from China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/outcry-as-world-health-organization-locks-out-taiwan-under-pressure-from-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/23/outcry-as-world-health-organization-locks-out-taiwan-under-pressure-from-china","fields":{"headline":"Outcry as World Health Organization locks out Taiwan under pressure from China","bodyText":"The World Health Organization has again rejected Taiwan’s request to join its annual assembly amid routine objections from China and despite strong support from a coalition of countries including the US, UK, France and Australia. The assembly in Geneva on Monday decided not to extend an invitation for Taiwan to attend the 21-30 May event as an observer. China and Pakistan spoke against the bid, while the Marshall Islands, Belize, Nauru and eSwatini – four of Taiwan’s 13 formal diplomatic allies – spoke in support. Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs said its participation in the WHO was a matter of global public health. “Politics should not be allowed to take precedence over professionalism. It is not only unfair and unjust to shut Taiwan out due to Chinese political pressure, but also poses a serious threat to global health. “No matter how the Chinese Communist party distorts Taiwan’s sovereign status, it cannot change the objective fact of our country’s existence.” Beijing’s blocking of Taiwan’s participation in global bodies is part of its long-running efforts to isolate Taiwan from the international community. The Chinese government claims Taiwan is a province of China which it intends to annex, and objects to any bilateral or multilateral engagements that bolster Taiwan’s sovereignty. China’s ministry of foreign affairs welcomed the WHO decision, claiming almost 100 countries had affirmed its “one China principle” and objected to Taiwan’s inclusion. It said Taiwan’s requests were “a political ploy to engage in ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities”. “China also urges certain countries not to pretend to be confused, stop politicising the health issue, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of the Taiwan issue, and stop the erroneous practice of using ‘Taiwan to control China’.’” Last week the Taiwan-based representatives of the UK, US, Australia, France, Japan, Lithuania, Canada, the Czech Republic and Germany issued a joint statement supporting Taiwan’s inclusion. “Inviting Taiwan as an observer would best exemplify the WHO’s commitment to an inclusive, ‘health for all’ approach to international health cooperation,” their statement said, noting that Taiwan had been given observer status before. The US mission in Geneva tweeted on Sunday that Taiwan’s isolation from the meeting “undermines inclusive global public health cooperation led by WHO”. Taiwan’s exclusion reportedly extended to its journalists covering the event. According to the government media organisation, CNA, two reporters had been approved for press passes last week but access was revoked when they went to pick them up in Geneva on Monday. The journalists said a UN staffer told them it was because of pressure from China, and nodded when asked if they “had to report everything to China”, CNA reported. Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs accused the UN’s Geneva office of having “failed to act impartially” and urged it to not “give in to unreasonable political pressure from certain countries”. The WHO has been contacted for comment. Taiwan’s exclusion from the WHA took on new significance during the pandemic, with Taipei and its supporters claiming it was missing out on timely information, and that the world was missing out on expertise which Taiwan could share. Taiwan had one of the world’s most successful pandemic responses. During the pandemic critics accused the WHO and its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, of being too deferential to China, accusations that the WHO and Tedros reject. In March 2020 an interview by Hong Kong media with a senior WHO adviser went viral, after the adviser appeared to hang up on the journalist when asked about Taiwan’s pandemic response, and then refused to answer further questions because they had “already talked about China”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2023/may/23/damian-hardwick-quits-afl-legacy-will-endure-he-changed-how-the-game-is-played","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T04:43:14Z","webTitle":"Damien Hardwick’s AFL legacy will endure – he changed how the game is played | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/23/damian-hardwick-quits-afl-legacy-will-endure-he-changed-how-the-game-is-played","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/may/23/damian-hardwick-quits-afl-legacy-will-endure-he-changed-how-the-game-is-played","fields":{"headline":"Damien Hardwick’s AFL legacy will endure – he changed how the game is played ","bodyText":"“Let’s be honest,” Brendan Gale told author and journalist Konrad Marshall. “He inherited a piece of shit.” Even by Richmond standards, 2009 was a rough year. Terry Wallace’s final weeks as coach were particularly unedifying. The Herald Sun ran with the headline “Death Row”. He departed mid-season and retreated to his bolt hole, barricading himself in his home theatre. His replacement was a Kevin Sheedy man. Damien Hardwick had the Sheedy cunning, the Sheedy mongrel. He’d narrowly missed out on four senior coaching roles. He was pipped for the Essendon job after his computer short circuited during the interview. It was always going to take time. He was always playing the long game. In his first year, smart arse bookmakers paid out on them finishing last halfway through the season. He lost three elimination finals in a row – the kind of games that would have broken a lot of a coaches, and a lot of clubs. They fell in a hole in 2016. By the end of that year, he’d won 74 of 157 matches. Resembling undertakers, rebel board candidates were determined to raze the place and start again. But the club held its nerve. They backed him in. A different Hardwick emerged. The cranky coach of 2016 was suddenly replete with homilies and dad jokes. His team played like kids – for fun and without fear. It helped that Dustin Martin had one of the greatest years a footballer has ever had. Indeed, in every sentence written about the Hardwick era, it should be mandatory to tack on at the end “… and he had Dusty”. I’ll always remember the game where they finally convinced me. It was a putrid July day. I’d been dragged to the MCG by a Richmond supporting friend. I was hypothermic and sceptical. He was long suffering, but buoyant. “Trust me mate, we’re ready to pop,” he said. He’d been saying that since Richard Lounder. Richmond had taken him to places no footy supporter should go. He was at intervention stage for a while there. Their opponent was GWS, a crack side that year. “The orange tsunami,” they were called. But the tsunami was the home side. They surged and swarmed. It was wave upon wave of power-endurance runners. It broke the Giants that day. And it changed football. We’d had the brutal simplicity of Leigh Matthews’ Brisbane, the free-flowing purity of Mark Thompson’s Geelong, and the Swiss precision of Alistair Clarkson’s Hawthorn. This was completely different. “Every game was an arm-wrestle that they always held a slight but undeniable advantage in,” Jay Croucher wrote for The Roar. “Their beauty was in the grind – the knowledge that wherever the ball was, whatever the state of play, they were always just a little bit harder than the opposition, and a little bit smarter.” It netted three of the next four premierships. They could have won all four if a Texan who slept diagonally on his bed wasn’t waiting with a baseball bat on preliminary final night in 2018. Any columnist who references Hemingway’s quote about bankruptcy (“gradually, then suddenly”) is usually two or three pieces away from complaining about the service at the bakery. But if Monday night’s news felt sudden, there were plenty of hints over the past few years. After the third flag, Hardwick’s marriage ended. Caroline Wilson was gunning for him. He was at Jonathan Brown’s throat. The team played at a frightening intensity that was simply impossible to sustain. They had a dire record at Docklands – a ground he and his supporters hated. They kept being overrun. They kept losing close games. “Richmond is killing Richmond,” he said a number of times. For 15 minutes against West Coast and for four quarters against Geelong in recent weeks, there were signs of life and hope. But that was dashed on Saturday night. He knew they weren’t playing finals. He was burnt out. One of his best friends had stepped down from the North Melbourne job a few days earlier. On Monday night, in a sign of the times, most of the focus was on whether Tom Morris had the right to break the story. Fox Footy paid a stunned tribute, and then quickly moved on to speculation over the coaching future of Adam Simpson. That’s footy. The dogs bark, and the caravan moves on. But the Hardwick era will endure. His impact can be seen at other clubs – the entire psychology and method of Collingwood right now screams Richmond in 2017. He changed how football is played. He took Richmond from a laughing stock to a colossus. He found the perfect balance of risk and reward, of the analytical and the animal. His teams would grind the opposition to dust, and then pick up their rubbish afterwards. “It’s been an incredible ride,” he said on Tuesday. “I’ve pushed every button I can.” There would be no farewell game. He was choking up. He was completely cooked. He wanted to leave the club, and the game, on good terms. He departed as a Richmond great – its longest serving coach – and as significant a figure as Hafey, as Hart, or as Bartlett."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/23/country-diary-a-boggy-untouched-paradise-for-wildlife","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T04:30:01Z","webTitle":"Country diary: A boggy, untouched paradise for wildlife | Amy-Jane Beer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/23/country-diary-a-boggy-untouched-paradise-for-wildlife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/23/country-diary-a-boggy-untouched-paradise-for-wildlife","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: A boggy, untouched paradise for wildlife","bodyText":"I’m standing in a bog surrounded by plantation and grouse moor. It is overlooked in more ways than I want to know by the dystopian hulk of the RAF Fylingdales radar station. But my guide is Brian Walker, a retired maverick forester, avid naturalist and spinner of excellent tales, so the invitation to visit was irresistible. In 1974, Brian’s friend and mentor, the botanist Margaret Atherden, persuaded the Forestry Commission not to plant this area, known as May Moss. Now I’m looking at the result. With each squelching step, the hummocky expanse of brown, gold and grey resolves into ling and cross-leaved heath, bog cotton and native cranberry still bearing last year’s fruit. Beneath them are the bright green, claret and crimson colours of sphagnum mosses and, delightfully, the candy pink flowers of bog rosemary, which, along with cloudberry, occurs nowhere else on the North York Moors. There’s a small pool where geese nest and, in the shadow of a remnant block of spruce, a suntrap shimmers with bronzy-winged red damselflies, bees, moths and the emerald flicker of green hairstreak butterflies. Spiders attend gleaming webs. Common lizards skitter at our feet, and Brian warns me to watch for adders. A cuckoo call sounds close by – the bird appears, flying strongly in hawkish silhouette, the first I’ve seen for years. Brian points out an area of scattered pine and birch known as the radhaz (radiation hazard) because of historical radiation risk, and explains that by fencing it off, the Ministry of Defence inadvertently created the most untouched moorland heath in England. “It gives an idea what the moors could look like if burning stopped,” he says. “Trees are often considered anathema to bog restoration, but they’re spaced out, don’t grow big. That place is teeming with life and the peat is six metres deep. Imagine, seven thousand years preserved under your feet.” It’s not just the past and present of May Moss that excites Brian. Like Atherden, he thinks of the futures. “Forestry doesn’t get everything right,” he says. “But with huge areas to work with we can experiment – a bit of local disruption can supercharge an ecosystem. Scrape back here, block a watercourse there, or we can suspend planting and just step back. It might take decades to see the benefits, but fine. Foresters are used to long cycles.” • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/23/refugees-huddle-together-in-dublin-camp-as-local-tensions-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T04:00:00Z","webTitle":"Refugees huddle together in Dublin camp as local tensions rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/refugees-huddle-together-in-dublin-camp-as-local-tensions-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/23/refugees-huddle-together-in-dublin-camp-as-local-tensions-rise","fields":{"headline":"Refugees huddle together in Dublin camp as local tensions rise","bodyText":"Ireland’s newest refugee camp starts with a row of tents on the pavement at Mount Street and curves round an alleyway into a car park – about 60 tents in total in the heart of Dublin’s business district. It began with a single tent in March outside the government’s International Protection Office (IPO) and grew week by week until forming this ragged, striking spectacle. The tents are a riot of colours. Some are new and taut, others torn and saggy. They huddle close to each other. “There is power in numbers. It’s better to be with a lot of people,” said Lourens van den Burg, 36, an asylum applicant from South Africa. “You don’t want to be out camping on your own.” The reason for that became apparent earlier this month when a crowd of protesters marched on the encampment chanting “Ireland for the Irish” and “You’re not welcome here”. Hooded men attacked another, smaller encampment at nearby Sandwith Street and set fire to the tents, which were unoccupied. “That’s it lads, take it down,” said a voice in a social media post that showed men scattering the debris. “Take it all down. Make it unliveable.” It was a stark manifestation of two crises that have collided in Ireland: a shortage of housing and a rise in refugees. An acute lack of affordable property – the government estimates a deficit of 250,000 homes – has fuelled homelessness and desperation in a growing population. This has coincided with an influx of more than 70,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion, plus a record 13,651 asylum applications last year from people from other countries. Hotels, reception centres and other lodgings are overflowing, leaving about 500 asylum seekers on the streets. “It wasn’t like I was expecting a mansion but I wasn’t expecting this. It’s my first time sleeping in a tent,” said Andile, a 30-year-old Zimbabwean who lives on Mount Street. He withheld his surname. He had thick socks to ward off the night-time chill and a stoic attitude. “You make do with what you have. If this is what it is, I’m fine as long as it’s safe.” The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has expressed concern that there are not enough police to combat anti-immigration attacks. The Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, has said the force has sufficient resources for “operational integrity”. Even non-violent protests require policing. Last week, residents of Inch, a town in County Clare, used tractors to blockade a road outside a facility housing 33 male refugees. After the government promised a four-week freeze on bringing further refugees, residents lifted the blockade but continued the protest. Some boarded a bus carrying asylum seekers to count and video them, drawing condemnation from migrant support groups. The backlash against refugees and immigrants flared last year with pickets outside accommodation centres in Dublin and rural towns. Slogans such as #IrelandIsFull and #IrishLivesMatter appeared on placards at rallies and on social media. Agitators outside Ireland praised the protesters. Nigel Farage said the Irish were “speaking out”. The Mount Street encampment has no facilities – people urinate into bottles – but offers safety in numbers, a police presence and ready access to the IPO, which processes asylum paperwork. Most of the people in tents seem to be from Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan. Homelessness charities provide showers and meals. “I can’t complain; I do eat and shower,” said Andile. The march on the encampment and the attack at Sandwith Street had a silver lining, said Volodymyr, 46, from Ukraine. “It made us famous. The taoiseach even became aware of the situation.” Pending accommodation and permission to work, the challenge was to fill the time, maintain dignity and stay safe, he said. “You spend the day wandering around the city looking for a socket to charge your phone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/23/italy-government-giorgia-meloni-state-broadcaster-rai","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T04:00:00Z","webTitle":"Italian government accused of exerting ‘ruthless’ influence at state broadcaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/italy-government-giorgia-meloni-state-broadcaster-rai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/23/italy-government-giorgia-meloni-state-broadcaster-rai","fields":{"headline":"Italian government accused of exerting ‘ruthless’ influence at state broadcaster","bodyText":"Sources at the Italian state broadcaster, Rai, have accused Giorgia Meloni’s rightwing government of wanting to bend the organisation to its will and “cancel Italy’s antifascism footprints” after a series of high-profile departures. In recent weeks Carlo Fuortes resigned as chief executive, citing pressure from the government, while Fabio Fazio, a left-leaning talkshow host, and his co-presenter, Luciana Littizzetto, a comedian known for her monologues targeting conservatives, left after failing to get their contracts for the popular Che Tempo Che Fa programme renewed. More departures are expected over the coming months. “With every change of government, there’s a change in governance at Rai,” said a source at the broadcaster. “The only difference now is that it is more ruthless, whereas before it was perhaps a little bit more, shall we say, gentlemanly.” Fuortes, who resigned a year before the end of his mandate, was swiftly replaced by the government-nominated Roberto Sergio, a Rai manager whose political stance “changes with the wind” according to who is in power, a source claimed. The role of director general has gone to Giampaolo Rossi, a former Rai board member backed by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist roots. Rossi is known for his controversial tweets and support of Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán. In 2019 he said in an interview with Primato Nazionale, a newspaper founded by a member of the extreme-right group CasaPound, that “antifascism is a caricature of the past”. A source with knowledge of the situation said: “Rai has always been influenced by governments, but with the current one there has been a quantum leap. They want to take control of Rai and change the narrative to their way of thinking, and to cancel the antifascism footprints of our country. This will mean weakening Rai and the public service.” The pressure on Fuortes began a few days before the general election last September when he came under fire from Brothers of Italy and the far-right League party after the French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy criticised Italy’s rightwing parties on a Rai 3 talkshow. The League called for Fuortes to be sacked, while Brothers of Italy filed a complaint with Italy’s communications watchdog. The parties won the election alongside Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the coalition took power in October. In his resignation letter to the economy ministry, Fuortes, who had been nominated by the government of the former prime minister Mario Draghi, said he refused to accept changes to Rai’s editorial line and programming. He added: “Since the beginning of 2023, there has been a political conflict concerning me and my position, which is weakening Rai and the public service.” Meloni’s government faced particular criticism for having allegedly pressured Fuortes into departing before the end of his mandate. “The behaviour towards Fuortes has been shameful,” said a former member of Rai’s parliamentary supervisory committee. “And Rossi’s appointment as director general seemed to already be a given – he’s considered a ‘strongman’ who will probably be CEO in a year.” An inkling of the influence Meloni’s leadership might try to exert over Rai’s programming emerged in the run-up to the elections when the Brothers of Italy official Federico Mollicone urged the broadcaster not to air an episode of the globally popular children’s cartoon series Peppa Pig over the inclusion of a same-sex couple in its cast of characters. “They’ll be working on getting their own people into network director positions,” said the former supervisory committee member. “So we’ll probably start to see more influence in programming further down the line. They’ll try to minimise leftwing narrative and influence popular programmes.” Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and leader of the League, was accused by the opposition of being “authoritarian” after celebrating the departure of Fazio and Littizzetto with a sarcastic “Belli ciao” tweet in reference to the Italian antifascist song. Fazio, who had been with Rai for 40 years and over that time had interviewed Mikhail Gorbachev, Barack Obama and Emmanuel Macron, said the government felt legitimised by its general election victory “to behave like the owner of the public sphere with little regard for the public and with a boundless greed”. Salvini claimed it was Fazio’s choice to leave Rai and to sign a new contract with Discovery. “Fazio was an asset to Rai and it was a mistake to lose him,” said Gianni Riotta, the director of the school of journalism at Rome’s Luiss University. “There has always been political influence, but there is a line that the government should be absolutely keen not to cross: Rai should not be homogenous; we need a public service that gives a range of opinions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/nsw-police-officer-who-tasered-95-year-old-dementia-patient-claire-nowland-suspended-from-duty-with-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T03:57:05Z","webTitle":"NSW police officer who Tasered 95-year-old dementia patient suspended from duty with pay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nsw-police-officer-who-tasered-95-year-old-dementia-patient-claire-nowland-suspended-from-duty-with-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nsw-police-officer-who-tasered-95-year-old-dementia-patient-claire-nowland-suspended-from-duty-with-pay","fields":{"headline":"NSW police officer who Tasered 95-year-old dementia patient suspended from duty with pay","bodyText":"The police officer who Tasered 95-year-old Claire Nowland at an aged care facility in Cooma last week has been suspended from duty with pay as pressure mounts for the bodycam footage of the incident to be publicly released. Nowland, who has dementia, is in end-of-life care at Cooma district hospital after the incident caused her to fall and sustain life-threatening head injuries. Police say Nowland was armed with a steak knife at the time of the incident. The NSW homicide squad is investigating the incident. Police confirmed the suspension of the officer on Tuesday morning but could not say how long the senior constable, who had 12 years of experience, will be suspended. Polce have ruled out releasing the bodycam footage publicly, with police commissioner, Karen Webb, saying on Monday that Nowland’s family did not want it released. But on Tuesday Greens MP and spokesperson for justice, Sue Higginson introduced a notice of motion to the NSW parliament calling on the police bodycam footage which captured the Tasering of Nowland to be released publicly. The Greens will also call for an independent investigation into the incident and a parliamentary inquiry into police powers and police responses when dealing with vulnerable people. “We’ve got a woman who is in end-of-life care because of the actions of police,” Higginson said. “We’re going to be pushing as hard as we can.” It comes as calls grow for a broader independent investigation of the incident, as well as police treatment of dementia sufferers. The investigation will be overseen by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC). But Higginson, said she was concerned about the LECC’s ability to properly oversee the case given a report tabled by the commission on Wednesday that said some of its powers had proved “illusory”. The commission admitted in the report that it had not been able to exercise its power to live monitor the interviews of police officers involved in incidents given it required the offending officers’ consent, who have declined during every case. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The police minister, Yasmin Catley, was asked in parliament on Tuesday how she would ensure the investigation is “robust and transparent”, to which she responded it was being run by “some of the best detectives we have in this state”. “Politicising this matter is not going to be of any assistance,” she added. “We must remember the family here and remember that there is an investigation under way.” On Monday, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said it was right for the LECC to oversee the investigation into the incident which he labelled “very troubling”. “It’s really important to have confidence in the investigation taking place,” he said. Guardian Australia also revealed on Sunday that six officers handcuffed a second nursing home resident, Rachel Grahame, in 2020, after she took a staff member’s lanyard.

In his statement to the inquiry, Moller said that during a briefing in February 2021 he was told Higgins wanted to delay making a formal police statement until after media reports had been published about her allegation. Higgins told police she had already undertaken media interviews. “I did not understand why Ms Higgins had chosen to involve the media prior to providing police with a formal statement, however my briefing articulated that Ms Higgins wanted to ensure the investigation was ‘active’ to support the media releases. “This had me immediately suspicious and questioning the motives of Ms Higgins for reporting the incident. This strategy by Ms Higgins significantly hindered the investigation as it was also extremely difficult for investigators to progress the investigation without a statement of complaint.” Moller urged Higgins not to speak to the media on several occasions during the investigation. Lehrmann, who pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent, has always denied the allegation of rape and no findings have been made against him. He was tried in the ACT supreme court last year but a mistrial was declared after juror misconduct. A planned retrial was abandoned after expert medical advice warned it posed a “significant and unacceptable risk” to Higgins’s mental health and her life. Much of the independent inquiry, before former Queensland solicitor general Walter Sofronoff, has focused on tensions between police and the director of public prosecutions over the decision to charge Lehrmann. The DPP, Shane Drumgold, believed police were reluctant to lay charges, while police have told the inquiry they did not believe charges were justified, based on the evidence they had gathered. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Moller has told the inquiry he did not believe there was enough evidence to charge Lehrmann, but he decided to lay charges – signing the summons himself – after receiving advice from the DPP. He said he believed Drumgold was “dismissive” of police concerns, “and had a predetermined position to charge and prosecute the subject”. “I remember specifically being told at one of the meetings between the investigation team and Mr Drumgold at Belconnen police station. Mr Drumgold said ‘it doesn’t matter what he says’ in reference to Mr Lehrmann being interviewed. At that stage Mr Lehrmann had not yet been offered a police interview. This comment shocked and concerned the investigators.” Moller said he was “concerned for the independence and integrity of the investigation” and arranged to meet with Drumgold. “When I met with Mr Drumgold on 1 June 2021 it was clear to me that he had already decided on progressing the prosecution even though he had not reviewed the evidence.” In earlier evidence before the inquiry, Drumgold said he had believed police were reluctant to charge Lehrmann, and had engaged either in “unsophisticated corruption” or “atomic-level stupidity” in trying to stop the case proceeding. In correspondence, Drumgold said there was a “very clear campaign to pressure” him not to charge Lehrmann, and that police investigators were “clearly aligned with the successful defence of this matter” during the trial. Drumgold later told the inquiry he no longer believed in a possible political conspiracy to derail the prosecution, and that he now thought a “skills deficit” on behalf of the officers explained police actions during the investigation. Conversely, Moller told the inquiry there was immense pressure on police to “progress” the Lehrmann investigation. He said the pressure came from intense media interest, the DPP and the upper echelons of the Australian federal police. “There was a significant amount of pressure on all of us,” he said on Tuesday. “There was pressure from my organisation … above me.” In his statement, Moller said the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, urged him to “get it done” when they met incidentally in Canberra. “The commissioner inquired how the investigation was progressing and I mentioned that we were soon to travel to Brisbane to interview the suspect. He seemed pleased with this and inquired if we were going to arrest and extradite him. “I commented and stated that if we did get to that stage, we would be more inclined to summons rather than arrest and charge. He said ‘well, we need to get it done, just get it done’. “This is an example of how much pressure was on everyone involved with this matter.” In June 2021, Moller met with Commander Michael Chew, who said the DPP had told him they would recommend prosecution. Moller’s statement said: “Commander Chew stated ‘if it was my choice, I would not proceed, but it is not my choice, there is too much political interference’. “I said ‘that’s disappointing, given I think there is insufficient evidence’.” Moller told the inquiry on Tuesday that Drumgold had “lost objectivity” in the Lehrmann matter. Moller remains in the witness box. Other police are expected to follow this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/nauru-offshore-detention-immigration-processing-to-cost-australia-485m-22-asylum-seekers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T03:40:28Z","webTitle":"Nauru offshore processing to cost Australian taxpayers $485m despite only 22 asylum seekers remaining","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nauru-offshore-detention-immigration-processing-to-cost-australia-485m-22-asylum-seekers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nauru-offshore-detention-immigration-processing-to-cost-australia-485m-22-asylum-seekers","fields":{"headline":"Nauru offshore processing to cost Australian taxpayers $485m despite only 22 asylum seekers remaining","bodyText":"Offshore processing on Nauru will cost Australia $485m this year, despite the fact there are just 22 refugees and asylum seekers left at the Pacific Island’s regional processing centre. Department of Home Affairs officials revealed the new figures at a Senate estimates hearing on Monday evening, but disputed suggestions from the Greens this amounted to a cost of $22m a person. Officials expect that in the next year no refugees and asylum seekers will remain on Nauru, but maintaining facilities for offshore processing will continue to cost at least $350m a year as a “contingency” to send people in the event of future boat arrivals. The department’s secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said it was both government policy and its direction to the department to “reduce the population to zero, and transition the facility to an enduring contingency”. Under questioning by Greens senator Nick McKim, the department’s associate secretary, Stephanie Foster, disputed the $22m figure, saying that “the costs for maintaining the facility are not attributable to the number of individuals – there’s a base level of cost required to maintain that capability”. Costs would decrease from $485m in the 2022-23 financial year, but would reflect a “higher level of readiness for a short period in the coming financial year”, Foster said. In 2025-26 and 2026-27, maintaining offshore processing is projected to cost $350m a year, despite the expectation no refugees and asylum seekers will be kept on Nauru. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup McKim told Guardian Australia “spending over $20m per year on each and every person in offshore detention reveals Labor’s warped priorities”. “The human cost of what is happening to innocent people on Nauru would be unacceptable even if it were costing us nothing financially,” he said. “Labor has the opportunity to right the historical wrong that it started by bringing every person still stuck in Papua New Guinea and Nauru here to Australia, where they can start to rebuild their lives.” In May 2016, Australia held 1,193 people on Nauru at an estimated per person cost of $534,000 a year. Numbers of refugees and asylum seekers have steadily decreased, down to 107 in August 2021, due to resettlement. On Tuesday evening the agriculture minister, Murray Watt, representing the home affairs minister, said Labor “would’ve preferred that the legacy caseload have been dealt with well before now, but it wasn’t”. Watt said the “the efforts of government” to resolve the cases of people on Nauru could be demonstrated by the reduction of number. “It’s taken significant work.” Officials revealed that in Australia and Nauru there were still 1,174 so-called “transitory persons” who arrived after the September 2013 deadline after which nobody who came by boat was allowed to permanently settle in Australia. Australia has a three-year deal with New Zealand that will allow up to 450 people to resettle there, and is investigating a similar deal with Canada. On Tuesday Australian Border Force officials revealed that eight boats holding more than 200 asylum seekers have been turned back under Operation Sovereign Borders in the past year. The OSB commander, Rear Admiral Justin Jones, said all eight of the boats had been “successfully resolved … returned to their place of origin safely and in accordance with Australia’s domestic and international legal obligations”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/23/papua-new-guineas-security-deal-with-the-us-is-a-win-for-washington-for-now","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T02:52:28Z","webTitle":"Papua New Guinea’s security deal with the US is a win for Washington – for now ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/papua-new-guineas-security-deal-with-the-us-is-a-win-for-washington-for-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/23/papua-new-guineas-security-deal-with-the-us-is-a-win-for-washington-for-now","fields":{"headline":"Papua New Guinea’s security deal with the US is a win for Washington – for now ","bodyText":"He may have just signed a new defence cooperation agreement with the United States, but the prime minister of Papua New Guinea was determined to make it clear that he did not want to be forced into making a binary choice between Washington and Beijing. Speaking after the deal was struck, James Marape reflected the view of Pacific leaders that they should not simply be seen as chess pieces in a broader geopolitical struggle,as China and the US step up their efforts to expand their influence among Pacific island countries. For Pacific countries, their priorities lie in their development needs and action on the climate crisis. Marape was joined at the signing ceremony in Port Moresby by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who represented Joe Biden after the cancellation of what would have been the first sitting US presidential visit to a Pacific island country. The US state department argued the agreement was simply a “natural progression” after decades of defence cooperation with PNG, allowing the two countries to “enhance security cooperation” and improve the capacity of the PNG defence force. The agreement would allow for “bilateral and multilateral exercises and engagements in support of regional capacity building priorities”, the state department said. It would also enable the US “to be more responsive in emergency situations, such as those involving humanitarian assistance and disaster relief”. Marape clearly wanted to take the opportunity to allay some domestic concerns about the new US agreement, the full text of which is expected to be released publicly soon. Those domestic concerns were highlighted by the opposition leader, Joseph Lelang, who said last week: “We have a foreign policy of ‘friends to all and enemies to none’. We … should not be blinded by the dollar sign or be coerced into signing deals that may be detrimental to us in the long run.” They were further underlined by protests at several universities on Monday. But Marape said the deal was the culmination of “many years and months of engagement” with US officials and “it wasn’t shoved down our throat”. The agreement, he said, was a mutual one driven by “the need for Papua New Guinea to have our defence force assisted, supported, stepped up”. It wasn’t a treaty-level document; that means there are no mutual defence obligations. Marape was also at pains to say that any visiting US personnel would “come in at the invitation of our defence force, and not at their own will”. Extending his message to his fellow Pacific leaders he added: “That’s something that must be clear [to] everyone in the Pacific – upon our invitation, they come in.” The parties also signed a second agreement to counter threats like illegal fishing and drug trafficking, with PNG able to participate in the US Coast Guard’s Shiprider program. Interestingly, the PNG government says nothing in the deals will stop the country from deepening its cooperation with others, including China. It also comes at a time when Australia is seeking to negotiate its own bilateral security treaty with Papua New Guinea. The Australian government insists it is still on track for a mid-year signing deadline. The minister for the Pacific, Pat Conroy, who was also in Port Moresby on Monday, said he was “confident that we will reach closure quite soon”. It appears the Australia-PNG deal is a broadly drafted agreement that reflects the Boe Declaration on Regional Security; the 2018 statement that described the climate crisis as the Pacific’s biggest security threat. “It does really reflect the breadth of the Boe Declaration, which said that security isn’t just about kinetic warfare, it’s about climate change, it’s about natural disasters, it’s about the right of countries to exist peacefully alongside each other,” Conroy said on Monday. “So it’s a broad treaty and it’s being negotiated in good spirit.” There was another significant visitor to Port Moresby on Monday: the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, who held talks with Pacific leaders on a stopover on his way from Japan to Australia. Modi addressed the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation and wanted to emphasise India’s reliability as a partner focused on practical cooperation, including in commerce, technology, health care and climate change. Marape gave him a warm welcome, describing Modi as the “leader of the global south”. Against this backdrop, the US has been rushing to open embassies in the region, including in Solomon Islands, and is renewing Compacts of Free Association with the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Michael Green, the chief executive officer of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney and a former senior US official, says: “The Pacific does not want to be a source of competition between the US and its allies versus China – but it is.” Green argues the PNG deal can be seen as “a win for the US for now”, after the signing of a security agreement between China and Solomon Islands last year sparked alarm in Washington and other capitals. He argues Beijing subsequently overplayed its hand in pushing for a wider regional security agreement with 10 Pacific countries. That push was rebuffed because leaders stressed the need to respect existing regional architecture, notably the Pacific Islands Forum. But Green says it would be wrong for policymakers in the US to be complacent: “It can swing back at any moment and we may wake up with headlines saying China has a security deal with one of the countries of Pacific islands. So it’s game on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/victoria-state-budget-winners-and-losers-free-kinder-new-taxes-on-businesses-and-the-end-to-native-timber-logging","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T02:51:19Z","webTitle":"Victoria state budget winners and losers: free kinder, new taxes on businesses and the end to native timber logging","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/victoria-state-budget-winners-and-losers-free-kinder-new-taxes-on-businesses-and-the-end-to-native-timber-logging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/victoria-state-budget-winners-and-losers-free-kinder-new-taxes-on-businesses-and-the-end-to-native-timber-logging","fields":{"headline":"Victoria state budget winners and losers: free kinder, new taxes on businesses and the end to native timber logging","bodyText":"The Andrews government has made tough decisions in Tuesday’s Victoria state budget to reduce its record debt accumulated during the height of Covid, while funding its election promises. Big businesses will taxed further to help repay the state’s debt, but the government has also introduced some relief, including employer insurance and shielding more from payroll tax. Here’s a breakdown of the winners and losers in Victoria’s 2023 budget: Winners Small businesses In an Australian first, Victoria will scrap business insurance duty over a 10-year period. The government estimates businesses will save about $3,200 on professional indemnity insurance or $2400 on fire and other special risk insurance over a decade. The tax-free threshold for payroll tax will also be lifted from $700,000 to $900,000, benefiting 4,200 businesses. A further 22,000 businesses will pay a reduced amount of payroll tax. From 1 July 2025, the payroll tax-free threshold will increase again to $1m. Kindergartens and schools The government will provide $1.4bn for its free kindergarten program and $1.6bn for its new three-year-old kindergarten scheme. The government will also inject $618m to build nine new schools in metropolitan Melbourne. Healthcare The government will inject $320m in funding for infrastructure works that includes preparing for a new emergency department at Queen Elizabeth II hospital in the eastern suburbs and a new hospital in West Gippsland. Additionally, the government has committed $286m for women’s health, including $65m for boosting surgeries to treat debilitating endometriosis, $58m for 20 new women’s health and a dedicated Aboriginal-led women’s clinic. Native forests and the State Electricity Commission Victoria will ban native forest logging from the start of next year, bringing forward a commitment to phase it out by the end of the decade. It comes amid a court challenge against the state-owned timber agency VicForests over the protection of endangered species, which the treasurer, Tim Pallas, cited when explaining the decision to bring forward the end of the industry. The government will also spend $1bn to revitalise the state-owned State Electricity Commission to boost jobs in renewable energy, as promised in Labor’s election campaign. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Losers Big businesses Big businesses will be hit by a 10-year Covid debt levy to help pay back the record borrowing the government undertook during the pandemic. From 1 July, large businesses with a national payroll above $10m year will pay additional payroll tax. A rate of 0.5% will apply for businesses with a national payroll above $10m and businesses with a national payroll above $100m will pay an additional 0.5%. The additional rates will be paid on the Victorian share of wages above the relevant threshold and are estimated to raise $3.9bn. Public service workers Up to 4,000 jobs will be slashed from the Victorian public sector, but no frontline workers such as nurses or teachers will be affected. The government is aiming to bring the state’s public service – representing a fifth of the state’s workforce – back to pre-pandemic levels, with $3.6bn in anticipated savings. The savings will include reducing corporate and back-office functions and cutting labour-hire and consultancy costs. The estimated public sector wage bill is $35.2bn (exclusive of superannuation), compared to $33.4bn this financial year. The increase is due to a raise in the public sector wage cap increasing from 1.5% to 3%. Property investors From January 2024, Victorians who currently pay land tax will be hit with an additional annual fee of $500 for landholdings worth between $50,000 and $100,000 and $975 for land worth between $100,000 and $300,000. For land worth more than $300,000, the $975 fee plus an additional hike of 0.1% will be charged. Family homes will remain exempt from land tax. Pallas said 860,000 Victorian landowners will be affected, who will pay an average of $1,300 in additional taxes. He justified the hike by pointing to the land values increasing by 84% in the past decade. Rents have also increased by 25% over five years. “These higher rents are due to effectively the laws of supply and demand at play, and then delivering a windfall to landlords. We think that it’s fair that Victorians with multiple properties make a modest contribution to repaying Covid debt,” Pallas said. Private schools From July 2024, high-fee private schools will no longer be exempt from payroll tax, which will raise $422.2m over three years. Budget papers estimate this will affect about 110 of the state’s most exclusive schools – or the top 15% by fee level. They currently don’t receive capital funding from the government. Major projects With an extensive federal infrastructure review under way, infrastructure projects across Victoria have been plagued with further uncertainty. The M80 Ring Road Upgrade, scheduled last year to be constructed by the first three months of the year, now has no set completion date and no funds allocated over the forward estimates. The North East Link – scheduled last year to be completed in the final three months of 2028, has no completion date and no earmarked funds. The West Gate Tunnel project – that will provide an alternative to the West Gate Bridge – is still on track to be completed by the end of 2025. The Metro Tunnel project is still scheduled to be completed in the final three months of 2025. The Geelong Fast Rail and Airport Rail projects have no estimated completion dates. Any delay to the Geelong Fast Rail will push back electrifying trains in Melbourne’s west. Native timber workers With the phasing out of native logging brought forward, timber workers will face job uncertainty. The government will invest $200m over the next four years to help workers transition into new industries. Every affected timber worker will be offered free retraining and every timber family in financial stress can apply for financial support. Pallas said he had a “great degree of sympathy and concern” for forestry workers and communities. “We don’t take any satisfaction in this,” he said. Commonwealth Games No additional funding has been set aside for Victoria’s 2026 Commonwealth Games. The government has estimated the major sporting event will cost at least $2.6bn and is hoping the federal government will contribute. The commonwealth’s budget this month did not include any money for the event. But the premier, Daniel Andrews, said he would not let the Albanese government off the hook."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/23/permanently-temporary-migrants-are-part-of-australia-labor-must-not-fail-them-again","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T02:49:26Z","webTitle":"‘Permanently temporary’ migrants are part of Australia.

Labor must not fail them again","bodyText":"Just weeks ago the Albanese government was handed a 200-page report that spelt out the failures of the migration regime in agonising detail. The report could not have been more emphatic. It described key areas of the migration system as irrevocably “broken”, requiring “major reform” that “cannot be achieved by further tinkering and incrementalism”. The report focused on the limbo faced by some 90,000 “permanently temporary” migrants, who have been in Australia for five or more years without a pathway to permanent residency, leaving them open to predation by bosses and landlords. It described the widespread wage theft from temporary migrant workers across the economy. It detailed the profit-hungry international education economy that takes $4bn from international students every year, often leaving them with little in return other than a massive debt. But just as the Albanese government is poised to respond to this “once-in-a generation” examination of the migration program, we hear reports of visa “scams”, human trafficking syndicates and agents and applicants alike “gaming the system”, – making it seem as though it is the temporary migrants themselves who are to blame for the dysfunction of the system. There is an eerie sense of history, and policy, repeating itself. In 2010 the Gillard Labor government oversaw sweeping reforms to international education and skilled migration in the name of clamping down on rogue international colleges and dodgy education agents. Little consideration was given to what this would mean for students, who in the public discourse often were deemed fraudulent by association. The result was the closure of multiple vocational education colleges, leaving students thousands of dollars out of pocket in part-paid course fees. Draconian fraud-related visa requirements were introduced that operated to fix visa holders with the consequences of their migration agent’s conduct, as though they were the same person – leading to mass visa refusals and visa holders being left in limbo as they were barred from applying for further visas for three years. But perhaps most importantly the remodelling of Australia’s skilled migration program to screen out supposedly unqualified international students left tens of thousands of former students, mostly from India and China, in the lurch. A decade later these former students now form the ranks of the “permanently temporary” – people who have been part of Australia for years, who have worked, made a life, had children and become part of the community, but still have no permanent right to stay. Now, as international students return to Australia in record numbers, a criminalising rhetoric serves to remind temporary migrants of their provisional and disposable status. It reminds them that, no matter how much Australians might rely on their work or economic contribution, they will continue to be viewed with suspicion as scammers looking to undermine the integrity of Australia’s otherwise impeccable migration program. But temporary migrants are not simply numbers on the national balance of payments. Nor are they passive victims who require law makers to step in and take responsibility for their lives. They are people who are an integral part of our community. Any doubt about that should have been dispelled by the pandemic. We would not have had fresh produce to eat, supermarkets to shop from or even public transport if it weren’t for the work of temporary migrants. If the Albanese government is serious about tacking the exploitation of migrant workers then it must remove the levers for exploitation in the migration system it administers. It must address the strict enforcement of visa conditions that render people vulnerable to extortion and threats by their bosses. It must provide protections for visa holders who take action for breaches of workplace laws. And it must address the inherent visa insecurity that leaves temporary workers dependent on their bosses for the hope of permanent residency. In short, the Labor government must put the rights of temporary migrants at the heart of its migration reforms and not in the margins. Otherwise it will be poised to make the same mistake twice. • Sanmati Verma is a managing lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/23/people-have-been-asking-why-there-are-so-many-nazis-in-melbourne-but-a-better-question-is-why-are-there-so-few","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T01:56:42Z","webTitle":"People have been asking why there are so many Nazis in Melbourne.

Perhaps understandably, people interstate have been asking why there are so many Nazis in Melbourne. But a better question would be why there are so few. During Victoria’s prolonged Covid-19 lockdown, the so-called “Freedom Movement” brought anti-vaxxers on to the city streets in their tens of thousands. Each rally served as a kind of far-right Woodstock, with genuine anger from, in particular, the much-neglected outer suburbs degenerating into a carnival of conspiracy. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads For a time, the far right seemed poised to break through. In 2020 and 2021, QAnon surged across Facebook; celebrity chef Pete Evans shared the “sonnenrad” symbol on his Instagram feed (he subsequently apologised for any offence to those who had ‘misinterpreted’ the post); anti-vaxxers trashed the CFMEU office. Street brawlers everywhere came together to rail against the health consequences of Covid vaccines, recognising in the fantasies about “pure bloods” resisting George Soros an ideology with which they could work. Yet, in 2023, when the National Socialist Movement calls a rally against immigration, it attracts … 30 people. Thirty fascists remain 30 fascists too many. Nevertheless, we should still celebrate the NSM’s palpable failure to grow. Melbourne’s hardcore fascists have struggled ever since the glory days of the United Patriots Front. The UPF enjoyed its brief moment of sunshine partly because it maintained a certain plausible deniability about all things Hitler. Back in 2015, Tom Sewell – the would-be dictator of the NSM – declared himself an ordinary bloke, concerned about threats to “our democratic process”. Sections of the media went along with this pretty transparent charade, with UPF leader and convicted criminal Blair Cottrell duchessed by JJJ’s Hack, invited to chat about immigration on Sky News and interviewed by Channel Seven about, of all things, “crime gangs”. Regular anti-racist protests made the true nature of the UPF increasingly undeniable; the social media networks bowed to pressure and blocked its accounts, radically limiting its ability to organise. Without its Facebook page, the UPF splintered. The 2019 massacre in Christchurch by a self-professed ‘admirer’ of the group sealed its demise. Here was the logical conclusion of the fascist cult – the slaughter of 51 people by a man under a pseudonym on one of the splinter group’s Facebook chat servers. For a while, the ex-UPFers tried establishing a series of white-only gyms under the name “Lads Society”. But that plan flopped, too. So under the banner of the National Socialist Movement, the masks came off – or, rather, went on, as the lads bravely equipped themselves with balaclavas to sieg heil for the cameras. Their various stunts have brought them into the media spotlight. But the problem for the Nazis is that they’re Nazis. Sure, openly proclaiming yourself a National Socialist attracts attention. But so does smearing yourself with faeces – and just because people stare and point, that doesn’t mean they want to join in. Nevertheless, the NSM’s persistent failures shouldn’t foster anti-fascist complacency. The sentiment that manifested during lockdown may have subsided but it hasn’t gone away. Nazis seize on any bigotry that’s going. Back in the day, the UPF fixated on Muslims. A few weeks back, the NSM gatechrashed Posie Parker’s transphobic rally to latch on to the anti-trans, anti-gay backlash currently sweeping the world. But if fascist rhetoric often just repeats standard “culture war” talking points, fascist practice rests on violence. That’s what distinguishes genuine Nazis from run-of-the-mill populists: a rightwing populist may rail against inner-city elites, immigrants and feminism in the name of the common folk; a fascist wants to eliminate all of them, presenting the brutal suppression of minorities and democratic rights as necessary for the salvation of a degenerate society. To grow appreciably, fascism must sell violence as not just spiritually redemptive but also as tactically successful. The cancellation of drag queen story time events gives them a chance to do precisely that. The harassment faced by staff puts libraries in an undeniably difficult position. Workers have a right to safety – and after Christchurch no one should minimise the danger from the right. But allowing bigots to determine what kids can and can’t hear sends a message: violence works. Every capitulation only encourages more threats, allowing the fascist thugs to present themselves as getting the rightwing job done. To their credit, a group of LGBTIQA+ advocates called the Rainbow Community Angels ensured that, even after the cancellation of the official session, a story reading still took place outside the Eltham library this week.

The vast ovine herds that outnumber human New Zealanders are a long-running joke outside the country; one of a few nuggets of information about New Zealand – alongside its links to The Lord of the Rings and Jacinda Ardern – that is know by the rest of the world. The country once had enough sheep to provide a small flock for every person, with the ratio peaking at 22 sheep for every human in the early 1980s. But with international wool markets in long decline, and forestry emerging as a more lucrative use of the land, sheep numbers in New Zealand have been dropping. National data released this week showed the national flock was 25.3m at June 2022 – a drop of 400,000, or 2% compared with the year before. With New Zealand’s estimated human population at 5.15 million, it was the lowest ratio of sheep to people since the 1850s, when national sheep numbers were first recorded, said Jason Attewell, Stats NZ general manager of economic and environment insights. He noted that New Zealand remained ahead of Australia in maintaining its sheep-to-person crown. “Australia currently has three times as many sheep as New Zealand, though their ratio is only around three sheep to every Aussie,” Attewell said. The global wool price has dropped significantly over the last decade: average export prices for New Zealand wool almost halved between 2013 and 2021, dropping from $6.74 a kilogram to $3.77. A price crash during the pandemic saw UK farmers getting an average price of just 32p a kilogram for wool – barely covering the cost of shearing. In New Zealand, an increasing number of high country sheep farmers have been selling farms or converting them to forestry, which, with the prospect of selling carbon offsets, now offers high returns. A 2022 independent report commissioned by farmers’ advocacy group Beef and Lamb NZ found that 175,000 hectares of whole sheep and beef farms had been sold with the intent to convert into forestry since 2017. It concluded that carbon-only farming was “a major driver of the increase in farm sales”, and from 2020-21 accounted for 39% of farm sales to forestry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/anti-kremlin-militia-freedom-of-russia-legion-overrun-russian-border-village-kozinka","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T00:31:38Z","webTitle":"Anti-Putin militia claims to have overrun village in Russia border region of Belgorod","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/anti-kremlin-militia-freedom-of-russia-legion-overrun-russian-border-village-kozinka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/anti-kremlin-militia-freedom-of-russia-legion-overrun-russian-border-village-kozinka","fields":{"headline":"Anti-Putin militia claims to have overrun village in Russia border region of Belgorod","bodyText":"Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces claimed to have overrun a border village within Russia for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, said it had crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Footage of the raid, purportedly from a border checkpoint in Grayvoron, showed casualties including a Russian officer lying face down in a pool of blood next to Russian passports and other documents scattered on the floor. The video also showed armoured vehicles appearing to overrun the post. Another anti-Kremlin militia, the Russian Volunteer Corps, which is led by a prominent Russian nationalist, also said it had taken part in the raid. Late on Monday it released video footage showing what it said was a fighter inspecting a captured armoured vehicle. Smoke was reportedly seen after unconfirmed reports that a drone had been used to drop explosives on an office of the FSB security service. The Belgorod governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said eight people were wounded after the town came under Ukrainian artillery fire, news agencies reported. Most residents had left the area but the situation remained “tense”, he said. In nearby Zamostye village, a projectile hit a kindergarten and caused a fire. One woman was wounded in her hand, Gladkov said. Under expanded powers, authorities were authorised to limit activities and movement and to suspend or restrict communication services including mobile networks and the internet. The growing chaos in the Belgorod region, where local authorities announced a “counterterrorist regime” on Monday evening, was a rare case where Russian villages have come face-to-face with a conflict that their army has unleashed across Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed and work was under way to drive out the “saboteurs”, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Any capture of territory had not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The Freedom of Russia Legion is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. “We are the same Russians as you,” said a statement put out by the Freedom of Russia Legion on social media. “We are distinguished only by the fact that we no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals in power and took up arms to defend our and your freedom. But today it’s time for everyone to take responsibility for their future. It’s time to put an end to the Kremlin’s dictatorship.” Video posted to social media showed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter trailing flares over Kozinka and videos of smoke rising from the settlement with emergency sirens clearly audible. Hundreds of cars were filmed leaving the area. “Something terrifying is happening,” said one woman filming from her window as a helicopter over Kozinka dropped flares meant to divert surface-to-air missiles. The governor of the Belgorod region confirmed an attack on Monday, writing that “sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine have entered the territory of the Grayvoron district. The armed forces of the Russian Federation, together with the border service, Rosgvardiya and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” The Kremlin said Moscow believed the attack was designed to “divert attention” from Bakhmut, the Ukrainian city where Russia is tightening its grip. Ukraine has disavowed connection to the Russian partisan fighters, saying that they act independently and are not subject to military control. “Yes, today the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion, which consist of citizens of the Russian Federation, have launched an operation to liberate these territories of the Belgorod region from the so-called Putin regime and push back the enemy in order to create a certain security zone to protect the Ukrainian civilian population,” Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence, told Ukrainian media. A Ukrainian presidential adviser wrote that Kyiv was “watching the events in the Belgorod region” but had nothing to do with the attacks – then wryly compared them to Russia’s past use of proxy forces to fight in Ukraine. “As you know, tanks are sold at any Russian military store, and underground guerrilla groups are composed of Russian citizens,” wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser. When Russia’s forces infiltrated Crimea as part of its illegal invasion and annexation in 2014, Vladimir Putin used similar language, saying they were local people who had bought their Russian-looking uniforms in military surplus shops. The US and other western powers have supplied weapons to Ukraine with the caveat that they not be used to strike targets inside Russia. Ukraine has denied any connection to past attacks on Russian territory, including strikes that have hit Russian airfields, energy infrastructure, and even the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. It is not clear whether the raid is part of a sustained military strategy or meant as a diversionary strike, as expectations remain that Ukraine is preparing to launch a summer counteroffensive to retake territory occupied by Russia. But clashes are increasing along the border in the Belgorod and Bryansk regions. Earlier this month, four Russian military aircraft, including two jets and two helicopters, were shot down in one of the worst single-day losses of the war. In March, the Moscow-born far-right militia leader Denis Nikitin claimed to have led a raid into a town in Bryansk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/datablog/2023/may/23/which-australian-city-has-the-best-weather-climate-most-sunny-days-where-should-i-live-interactive","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T00:30:49Z","webTitle":"Which Australian city has the weather that suits you best?

Find out with our interactive","bodyText":"Melbourne is famous for experiencing “four seasons in one day” – but Sydney is rainier, Hobart has less sunshine and Canberra is more likely to experience quick drops in temperature. Everyone appreciates different aspects of a city’s weather – so which one is right for you? We’ve taken a deep dive into the country’s weather data and created a tool that can answer that question. Tell us how hot, cold, humid, sunny or rainy you prefer it to be and we’ll tell you the Australian capital that suits you best. Then read on for a closer look at the data. We got hourly data for each capital city for the past 23 years – that’s more than 8,000 days of data. Surprisingly, Canberra tops the list for hot days – these are days that are hotter than the longterm average maximum for the city and season, rather than the hottest overall in Australia. Canberra also has the highest number of days with more than 10C of daytime temperature variation. Darwin has the most days with more than 5mm of rain, thanks to a long wet season with monsoonal rains. Sydney has the highest number of recorded severe storms and the Brisbane the most hail storms – but the data on this is patchy and only goes back about 10 years. Climate change, seasons and differing geographies mean all Australian cities are pretty variable, in their own ways. A huge number of factors can influence this, according to Dr Linden Ashcroft, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne. Ashcroft notes that both macro geographies (such as how close you are to the equator) and micro geographies (such as mountain ranges, deserts and urban areas) have a huge impact on the weather. Among other things these affect the direction and source of breezes, whether air can flow or is trapped, whether there is thermal mass to even out temperature fluctuations. “Parramatta [in Sydney], is quite often the hottest place in the world in the summertime because of the Blue Mountains … and also the fact that Sydney stretches so far west and the sea breeze doesn’t extend that far inland,” Ashcroft says. ”You also see that in Melbourne, where the sea breeze will intrude in the CBD and it might get up into some of the northern suburbs, but not the airport.” Brisbane and south-east Queensland often experience severe storms because of the interaction between weather coming in from the ocean and from the mountain range. “There’s this interaction between moist air sources coming off the ocean and dry air sources coming from inland and you get this trough – it’s like a little dip in the air pressure and depending on where that sits, you can get some really explosive thunderstorms”, Ashcroft says. We set out to test whether Melbourne really does have “four seasons in one day” – days that are at some point hot, cold, rainy and stormy. But it turns out that Darwin, Adelaide and Canberra have the most days that fit this criteria – more than 500 days in the past two decades. Melbourne is quite far down the list. But the huge variation in and across Australia’s capital cities means this was always likely. Darwin has more days with greater than 5mm of rain and so is more likely to fullill all these criteria. And Canberra has the largest average range in temperatures across the day throughout the year. Melbourne gets a lot of its rainier days in winter, but that’s also the time of year when its temperature range reduces significantly. Melbourne has the most rainy days if you set the bar lower – at 1mm of rain in a day. You can explore temperature ranges by city in the chart below: Ashcroft proposes another test for “four seasons in a day” – quick changes in temperature. “To go from 40 degrees to 20 degrees in 50 minutes, that is a very quintessential Melbourne thing, right?” Melbourne is closer to the top of cities that experience quick drops in temperature, but still well behind Canberra and slightly behind Darwin. This is probably explained by Canberra and Darwin having relatively stable temperature ranges throughout the year. Here are all the days since 2000 that have experienced a greater than 5C drop in an hour. One thing stands out about Melbourne – its peak temperature tends to come later in the day. This may explain why it feels that the city has more “seasonality” – it has relatively cold mornings and the peak temperatures are later in the day. So even in the shoulder months, on what would be hot days, you still need to layer. We can see this a little clearer by charting the average temperatures throughout the day. We can see that even though Melbourne might experience the same peak temperatures throughout the day as Adelaide or Sydney, it’s often a lot colder in the morning. Notes and methods: Defunct weather stations have been replaced with the closest station geographically. Measurements that were null or questionable have been dropped. Humidity, hours of sunshine and days of rain and clear skies based on long-term climate data for each city. Longterm data on number of days of rain uses a 10mm cutoff. The rest of the Guardian analysis uses days with greater than 5mm of rain. Longterm averages based on Bureau of Meteorology climate statistics for Australian locations. Data is not available for every site so the closest has been used. Temperatures were averaged across three weather stations for each capital city A day counts as rainy if any of the three weather stations recorded more than 5mm rain on that day. Storms and hailstorms were geolocated based on latitudes and longitudes in the Bureau of Meteorology’s severe storms archive. City selection based on minimising the euclidian distance between vectors representing the inputs and long-term data for the cities. Spring is defined as September, October and November. Summer is December, January and February. Autum is March, April and May. And winter is June, July and August. The same season definitions have been applied to all cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/penny-wong-gives-qualified-defence-of-robodebt-officials-900000-aukus-role","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T00:07:19Z","webTitle":" Penny Wong gives qualified defence of robodebt official’s $900,000 Aukus role ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/penny-wong-gives-qualified-defence-of-robodebt-officials-900000-aukus-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/penny-wong-gives-qualified-defence-of-robodebt-officials-900000-aukus-role","fields":{"headline":" Penny Wong gives qualified defence of robodebt official’s $900,000 Aukus role ","bodyText":"Penny Wong has given a qualified defence of a decision to appoint a public servant who held the top jobs at the two departments responsible for robodebt to a plum role as an adviser on Aukus. The foreign minister told Senate estimates that the decision had been made before the royal commission began and evidence that has since come out went “beyond what [she] would’ve anticipated”. Kathryn Campbell was given the $900,000-a-year job in June 2022, leaving her role as the head of the foreign affairs department. She was in charge of the human services department from March 2011 to September 2017, then social services until July 2021, two departments which were central to the robodebt program, and in December 2022 was questioned at the robodebt royal commission. At a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, the Greens senator Barbara Pocock questioned why the appointment had been made at a time the government already had findings of the federal court that robodebt was unlawful and had issued letters patent to set up a royal commission. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong, representing Anthony Albanese at the hearing, replied that while the court may have found the program was unlawful it would not “be fair to say there had been an interrogation of how that illegality came about”. “The royal commission was intended to elicit that information,” she said. “Some of the evidence has been beyond what we might have envisaged … It’s been quite substantial. But we would say – I don’t want to, obviously, speculate on potential findings of the commission.” Pocock then asked why the government hadn’t simply ended Campbell’s employment, who she described as the “captain of the ship” during robodebt. Wong replied that describing Campbell in such terms “assumes the knowledge of what has subsequently occurred in the commission”. “I think the illegality was found, but how that came about… was precisely why the royal commission was established,” she said. Wong added that the evidence before the commission went “certainly beyond what I would’ve anticipated”. The commission is due to report back on 7 July after a one-week extension was granted by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. David Williamson, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s deputy secretary of governance, said Campbell had “indicated an interest in a further role” in the commonwealth public service in mid-June 2022. The defence department secretary then “took the decision to make that appointment”, he said, before an announcement by Albanese on 22 June. Williamson said the royal commission is “yet to report” and officials would be “reluctant to make any comment about what it may or may not find in relation to individuals”. Last year Campbell told the commission she accepted the scheme had been a “significant” failure of public administration. Campbell said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions about the legality of the scheme, and conceded external legal advice should have been sought. “In hindsight it was a big assumption to make,” she said. In April the government services minister, Bill Shorten, warned that public servants adversely named by the robodebt royal commission could face disciplinary action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/significant-turnaround-in-australian-house-prices-defies-predictions-as-demand-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T00:00:48Z","webTitle":"‘Significant turnaround’ in Australian house prices defies predictions as demand rises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/significant-turnaround-in-australian-house-prices-defies-predictions-as-demand-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/significant-turnaround-in-australian-house-prices-defies-predictions-as-demand-rises","fields":{"headline":"‘Significant turnaround’ in Australian house prices defies predictions as demand rises","bodyText":"A stronger than expected lift in demand over the past two months is nudging property prices higher and delivering the highest auction clearance rates in more than a year, data group CoreLogic says. If the price rises are maintained for the rest of the year, home values will end up about 4% higher in 2023, defying earlier predictions of sharp falls of 10% or more for this year, CoreLogic says. “Economists are shredding their previous price forecasts,” said Sally Tindall, research director for RateCity. “There’s been a significant turnaround.” The prediction followed another week of rising auction clearance rates. Preliminary clearance levels were 75.3%, the highest in 15 months, in the third consecutive week above 70% before revisions, CoreLogic said. The buoyant demand came despite the Reserve Bank surprising most economists at the start of May with another interest rate rise, the 11th since last May. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Surging population growth and expectations that the RBA may only have one more hike to come have underpinned the rebound in real estate. Also supporting prices and clearance rates is a decline in property listings. As of April, there were 138,144 listings across Australia, near decade lows and down more than a third from the average for the month, CoreLogic said. But past figures indicate that for each 1% increase in property prices, listings rise 0.5%, so listings could soon rise given the price increases. “There is still some uncertainty around the trajectory for the cash rate, particularly given the latest monetary policy announcement showing a tightening bias from the Reserve Bank,” said Eliza Owen, CoreLogic’s head of research. There are other uncertainties, including how many properties come on to the market because their owners are unable or unwilling to keep paying off the debt, Tindall said. “[Prices] are defying gravity at the moment,” she said, adding that anecdotal evidence suggested some investors were opting to offload their properties. But she said the banks “aren’t seeing huge amounts of [mortgage] distress either”. The bank regulator, Apra, is due to release its updated report on non-performing loans on 6 June. The previous report, for the December quarter, showed there were 8,893 loans that were between 30 and 89 days overdue, down from more than 10,500 in March 2021. Since then, however, there have been three more interest rate rises from the RBA, and many borrowers will be shifting from fixed to variable rates, magnifying the mortgage hit. Tindall said the recent rebound in prices can’t be taken for granted. For one thing, while some people will have received a pay rise, most pay packets aren’t keeping up with inflation. “We’re also expecting a significant increase in unemployment,” she said. “People who don’t have a job find it difficult to pay their mortgage”, especially if they have run down any savings buffer they might have built up during the pandemic. Westpac last week said it would lower the stress test on certain refinance applications to help borrowers out of their so-called mortgage prison. The modification also applied to Westpac subsidiaries St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA. Banks typically require borrowers to be able to afford their debt repayments even if they were charged three percentage points higher than the rate they applied for, RateCity said. That curb, though, held back some borrowers from being able to take advantage of market competition to refinance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/e-jean-carroll-donald-trump-cnn-town-hall-damages","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T23:42:48Z","webTitle":"E Jean Carroll files for new damages after Trump’s CNN town hall remarks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/e-jean-carroll-donald-trump-cnn-town-hall-damages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/e-jean-carroll-donald-trump-cnn-town-hall-damages","fields":{"headline":"E Jean Carroll files for new damages after Trump’s CNN town hall remarks","bodyText":"Author and columnist E Jean Carroll is going back to court to demand “very substantial” additional damages from Donald Trump for the disparaging remarks he made about her during a televised CNN town hall just a day after he was found liable in a civil case for sexually assaulting her. An amended lawsuit seeking an additional $10m in compensatory damages – and more in punitive damages – was filed in Manhattan on Monday by lawyers for Carroll, who say remarks made by the former president in response to her rape allegations have so spoiled her reputation that she lost her longtime job as an Elle magazine advice columnist. On 9 May, a New York jury ruled that Trump had sexually abused the advice columnist in a New York department store changing room 27 years ago. It also awarded about $5m in compensatory and punitive damages: about $2m on the sexual abuse count and close to $3m for defamation, for branding her a liar. The following night, during a live town hall where Trump was interviewed on CNN in New Hampshire, Trump further and repeatedly insulted and demeaned Carroll and her experiences. Trump said her account of a sexual assault, in the case which he is appealing, was “fake” and a “made-up story” and referred to it as “hanky-panky”. He repeated past claims that he’d never met Carroll and considered her a “whack job.” Carroll’s new filing aims to inflict a further financial penalty against Trump for those remarks, claiming they are defamatory. Lawyers for Carroll said that Trump had “doubled down” on derogatory remarks about her a day after the verdict. The filing claimed Trump’s statements at the televised town hall “show the depth of his malice toward Carroll, since it is hard to imagine defamatory conduct that could possibly be more motivated by hatred, ill will or spite” and demanded “a very substantial punitive damages award in Carroll’s favor both to punish Trump, to deter him from engaging in further defamation and to deter others from doing the same.” Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, told the New York Times on Monday evening that Trump’s remarks on CNN “makes a mockery of the jury verdict and our justice system” if the former president was allowed to get away with repeating defamatory statements. Carroll, who testified during the trial, first revealed in a 2019 book her claims that Trump raped her in a dressing room. The jury decided Carroll hadn’t proved she had been raped, but found that Trump had sexually abused her. Speaking after the verdict earlier this month, Carroll, 79, said her case was “not about the money” and that the outcome broke down barriers for women and “demolished” the myth of the “perfect victim”. “Before yesterday there was a concept of the perfect victim,” Carroll said. “The perfect victim always screams, always reports to the police, always makes note when it happened and then her life is supposed to … fold up and she’s never sort of supposed to be happy again. “And yesterday we demolished that whole concept. It is gone. It is gone. And I am overwhelmed with happiness for the women of the country. It’s really not about me so much. It’s about every woman.” The Associated Press contributed reporting"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/sudan-weeklong-ceasefire-delivery-humanitarian-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T23:23:07Z","webTitle":"Sudan: US-Saudi brokered ceasefire begins with reports of continued fighting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/sudan-weeklong-ceasefire-delivery-humanitarian-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/sudan-weeklong-ceasefire-delivery-humanitarian-aid","fields":{"headline":"Sudan: US-Saudi brokered ceasefire begins with reports of continued fighting","bodyText":"A weeklong ceasefire in Sudan intended to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid got off to a shaky start on Monday evening as witnesses in the capital, Khartoum, reported fighter jets over the city and continued fighting in some areas. The US and Saudi Arabia announced the deal to stop six weeks of fighting, saying it would come into force at 9.45pm (7.45pm BST). World powers had put pressure on the army and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces to sign a deal. Previous attempts have fallen apart. Heavy bombardments could be heard in east Khartoum, witnesses said, and one resident shared a picture of thick black smoke rising into the sky. In Omdurman and Bahri, twin cities adjoining Khartoum, shooting could reportedly still be heard. In the hours before the ceasefire went into effect, the army conducted heavy airstrikes across the capital, Khartoum, against its paramilitary rivals. Although fighting has continued through previous ceasefires, this was the first to be formally agreed after negotiations. Fighting has pitted the Sudanese army, led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the RSF, led by Burhan’s former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. More than a million people have been displaced, and millions more trapped with limited access to water, electricity and medicine. The ceasefire deal includes for the first time a monitoring mechanism involving the army and the RSF as well as representatives from Saudi Arabia and the US, which brokered the agreement after talks in Jeddah. Shortly before the ceasefire was due to take effect, the RSF released an audio message from Dagalo in which he thanked Saudi Arabia and the US but urged his men on to victory. “We will not retreat until we end this coup,” he said. Aid agencies have struggled to operate amid the violence, with facilities attacked during the conflict. The Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate has accused the RSF of robbing and attacking reporters. Ahmed Fadol, a reporter, and Rashid Jibril, a freelance videographer, at Al Jazeera were beaten along with their relatives who were in an apartment when RSF soldiers raided it last week, the syndicate said. “The journalists’ syndicate rejects targeting and terrorising the journalists and holds the parties of the armed conflict full responsibility of their safety while they are working in extremely complex conditions,” the syndicate said in a statement. In West Darfur state, Inaam Elnour, a journalist, was injured and three of her brothers were killed when a shell targeted her house in el-Geinana last week, with 2,000 other people killed during clashes between the armed forces since 15 April. In South Darfur state’s capital city, Neyala, two journalists were assaulted; Khalid Sharaf was injured on his arm and leg by a missile that targeted his house on Sunday; and Eissa Dafaallah was arrested and beaten by the RSF while he was covering the looting and burning of a market. Dafaallah was later released after being accused of working for the army intelligence. Other local journalists, some working with regional media outlets, complained that their names were put on a list accusing them of supporting the RSF."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/may/23/caffe-nero-launches-major-book-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T23:01:47Z","webTitle":"Caffè Nero launches major book awards ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/23/caffe-nero-launches-major-book-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/23/caffe-nero-launches-major-book-awards","fields":{"headline":"Caffè Nero launches major book awards ","bodyText":"Caffè Nero is launching a new suite of writing awards, a year after fellow coffee shop chain Costa scrapped its popular book awards. Like the Costa prizes, the not-for-profit Nero book awards will choose winners in various categories. These categories are mostly the same as the Costas were: children’s books, debut fiction, fiction and nonfiction. However, there will not be a poetry category in the prize’s inaugural year. The Nero awards will be open to books by writers based in the UK and Ireland, and will be administered by trade organisation the Booksellers Association. The awards are also in partnership with Brunel University London and Right to Dream, a charity dedicated to “expanding people’s understanding of excellence through football”. Each award will carry a prize of £5,000. The four category winners will then compete for an overall award, titled the Nero Gold prize, which is worth £30,000. Meryl Halls, managing director of the Booksellers Association, said the awards were “first and foremost for readers, but their impact will be felt widely – by authors, publishers, agents, book retailers, libraries and festivals – as they create discussion around nominated books and drive consumer engagement with bookshops and libraries”. The emphasis, she added, would be on “commercial books with wide appeal”. Addressing the fact there was no poetry category, a spokesperson for the awards said: “These are a brand-new set of awards, developed in partnership with Caffè Nero and the Booksellers Association. The chosen categories reflect the main genres readers are most likely to find/see when they visit a bookshop or online retailer. As the awards become established over time, it’s possible additional categories could be added in the future.” The awards will be judged by industry professionals, including booksellers, authors, media commentators and influencers. Each award will have a shortlist of four titles. The shortlists for the first year of the awards will be announced in November, with the category winners revealed in January and the overall winner named in February. The Costa book awards were scrapped suddenly in 2022, in what the company’s CEO Jill McDonald described as a “difficult decision”. The awards began in 1971, and were known as the Whitbread book awards until 2005, when Costa took over the running and financing. The last Costa book of the year winner, in 2022, was former teacher Hannah Lowe, for her book of sonnets, The Kids, drawing on her experiences teaching in an inner-city sixth form and which won the poetry prize."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2023/may/23/law-commission-consultation-review-rape-sexual-assault-trials","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T23:01:47Z","webTitle":"Law Commission calls for tighter rules on use of personal records in rape trials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/23/law-commission-consultation-review-rape-sexual-assault-trials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/23/law-commission-consultation-review-rape-sexual-assault-trials","fields":{"headline":"Law Commission calls for tighter rules on use of personal records in rape trials","bodyText":"Greater restrictions should be introduced on the use of rape complainants’ personal records and evidence relating to their sexual behaviour to avoid rape myths contaminating trials in England and Wales, a government-commissioned review has said. The Law Commission suggested that legislative change was necessary to address the decline in rape prosecution and conviction rates since 2016, warning that “pernicious” myths and misconceptions about rape and sexual assaults “filter through the breadth and depth of the criminal justice system”. Campaigners have been warning for years that intrusive demands for rape complainants’ private information during criminal investigations discourage victims from coming forward and, when used in court, can affect the outcomes of trials. A government amendment to the victims and prisoners bill, announced last week, which it said would halt such practices by police was dismissed by campaigners as merely restating the existing law. In a long-awaited consultation, published on Tuesday, the Law Commission said there should be a bespoke set of laws for sexual offence cases, governing access to all complainants’ personal records – including therapy notes – by police and lawyers, and their use in trials. The review proposes introducing a requirement for judicial permission, with judges deciding whether the evidence is sufficiently relevant and in the interests of justice to override the complainant’s right to privacy. The commission’s proposal is based on the Canadian model, which it also adapts in relation to evidence on the complainant’s sexual behaviour, which it says the judge should allow only if it is of genuine value and does not risk prejudice. It recommends that a similar test is applied to evidence relating to any compensation claim made, as this can be used “to undermine the complainant’s credibility and to suggest that their allegation is false and for the purpose of financial gain during cross-examination”. Campaigners welcomed the commission’s recommendations but said they had been too long coming. Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said rather than delivering justice and support, survivors and advocates have long said that the criminal justice system is a site of harm, which retraumatises victims and reinforces victim-blaming at every turn. These recommendations are a hugely important step in transforming this and building a fairer and more equal society. “Despite a government apology and countless commitments to transforming the system, charging and conviction rates remain alarmingly low. All of these issues are rooted in sexist stereotypes and rape myths. “If the government is serious about ending violence against women and girls, it is imperative that it acts on the outcome of this consultation. This cannot just be another review that goes nowhere.” The Law Commission also proposed that complainants should have the right to exclude the public – and all members of the press bar one – while giving evidence. Additionally, the consultation asks for views on whether expert evidence should be used to educate jurors in relation to, for example, victims freezing during an assault, or delayed reporting to the police; and whether there should be rape trials without juries, as planned in Scotland, although these were not endorsed by the commission. Jayne Butler, the CEO of Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales, said: “The victims and prisoners bill, which is currently before parliament, is an excellent opportunity to address some of the Law Commission’s proposals sooner rather than later. Real and meaningful change for survivors is urgent and it’s essential that we don’t let opportunities for such change pass us by.” Harriet Bland, a lawyer at the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “We will be making detailed submissions on the proposals during the consultation period but would strongly encourage the government to act on calls for change now.” The consultation will run until 29 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/eddie-howe-surprised-by-newcastles-rapid-progress-after-top-four-finish","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T22:46:53Z","webTitle":"Eddie Howe surprised by Newcastle’s rapid progress after top-four finish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/eddie-howe-surprised-by-newcastles-rapid-progress-after-top-four-finish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/eddie-howe-surprised-by-newcastles-rapid-progress-after-top-four-finish","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Howe surprised by Newcastle’s rapid progress after top-four finish","bodyText":"Eddie Howe admitted that Newcastle have made faster progress than expected as he hailed his team’s “amazing achievement” in qualifying for the Champions League after being involved in a relegation skirmish only last season. “We’ve shot ahead of schedule and that brings big challenges for the future,” said Howe following the 0-0 draw against Leicester at St James’ Park which guaranteed Newcastle a top four finish. “But you have take these opportunities and it feels amazing. It’s an amazing achievement to go from where we’ve come from to here. It’s emotional; I’m very proud of everyone connected with the club. “This wasn’t in our sights at the start of the season. We’d just escaped relegation and we were hopeful of growing and competing for Europe in a couple of seasons time so I can’t compliment the players enough. It would have been very easy to fade away but we didn’t.” A smiling Howe seemed to struggle to comprehend he had become the first manager to lead Newcastle into the Champions League since Sir Bobby Robson 20 years ago. “I still have a lot of prove but I always hoped to bring success here,” he said. “I don’t know how I’ll celebrate but I hope it’s not with a tea and biscuit. “The Champions League is the best competition to be in, to break into that monopoly is quite something. Although I’m not outwardly emotional, inwardly I am. It’s very special to be part of something very special that will hopefully be talked about for years to come. It’s been an amazing season.” Leicester, the 2016 champions, are now dependent on Everton failing to beat Bournemouth at Goodison Park on Sunday, while they win their own home game against West Ham. Even so, Dean Smith had no regrets about starting with a back five on Tyneside. “I make no apologies for the way we set up,” said Leicester’s interim manager whose side maintained a rare clean sheet. “It was a real battling performance. We hadn’t kept a clean sheet for so long and where we are now is because of that. “It almost worked out exactly to plan but their goalkeeper (Nick Pope) made a really good save (from Timothy Castagne) with our only shot. It was the best way for us to get a result if it is too little too late, who knows. But we didn’t come here for a point, we came here to be hard to beat and we’ve taken it (the relegation fight) into the last game.” If Smith was generally sanguine, he rued the referee, Andre Marriner’s decision, endorsed by VAR, to issue Newcastle’s Bruno Guimarães an early yellow rather than a red card following the Brazilian’s high challenge on Boubakary Soumaré. “It could have been a very different game,” lamented Smith. “Bruno could have been sent off. I don’t think anyone could have complained it had been a red rather than a yellow. It was a dangerous lunge with endangered an opponent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/22/pentagon-ai-generated-image-explosion","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T22:42:57Z","webTitle":"Fake AI-generated image of explosion near Pentagon spreads on social media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/pentagon-ai-generated-image-explosion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/22/pentagon-ai-generated-image-explosion","fields":{"headline":"Fake AI-generated image of explosion near Pentagon spreads on social media","bodyText":"An AI-generated image that appeared to show an explosion next to a building in the Pentagon complex circulated on social media platforms on Monday, in the latest incident to highlight concerns over misinformation generated by AI. The image of a tall, dark gray plume of smoke quickly spread on Twitter, including through shares by verified accounts. It remains unclear where it originated. The US Department of Defense has confirmed that the image was a fake. Still, its virality appears to have caused a brief dip in the stock market, CNN reports. In a tweet, the fire department for Arlington, Virginia, outside of Washington DC, said that it was aware of social media reports about the explosion but that there was no threat to the public. OSINTdefender, a Twitter page that shares news about international military conflicts and has over 336,000 followers, was one of the verified pages that shared the photo. The page’s owner apologized for spreading misinformation and said the incident was an example of how “easily these sort of images can be used to manipulate the information space and how dangerous this could be in the future”. The image is one of several AI-generated ones that have gone viral in recent weeks. Recent examples include one of the pope wearing a fashion-forward white long puffer coat and a black and white photorealistic image that won a prize from the Sony World Photography Awards. The German artist who created the prizewinning image said he applied to the awards as a “cheeky monkey” to find out if competitions would be prepared for AI images to enter. He ultimately rejected the award. The incident also once again spotlighted verification challenges on Twitter, since the platform overhauled its subscription service, Twitter Blue. Up until last month, the platform gave out blue check badges to users whose identity the platform had verified. Under the new Twitter Blue program rolled out last month, however, individuals can pay $8 a month for a blue check mark.

Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Tuesday afternoon will hand down his ninth budget, which will detail a “Covid-19 debt repayment plan” that includes new revenue measures and savings to get the state’s borrowings under control. Guardian Australia has confirmed this will include a new levy on “big business” – though it remains unclear how many businesses will need to contribute. It comes after Pallas introduced a “mental health and wellbeing levy” in the 2021 budget to fund reforms to the state’s mental health system. Businesses that pay more than $10m in wages nationally must pay that levy through a payroll tax surcharge of 0.5% for their Victorian employees. Businesses with national payrolls above $100m pay 1%. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The levy was fiercely opposed by industry groups and the opposition at the time, though Pallas maintained it was appropriate that businesses which benefited during the pandemic be asked to make substantial contributions in its wake. In a separate measure likely to be welcomed by business groups, Pallas on Tuesday morning announced landmark reform to abolish stamp duty for commercial and industrial properties. The lump-sum stamp duty system for these properties will transition to an annual property tax from 1 July 2024, which he said will “help businesses expand and create new jobs”. The new tax will be 1% of the land’s unimproved value. For first purchasers of commercial or industrial properties, there will be a choice between paying the property’s final stamp duty liability as an upfront lump sum, or transition to an annual payment by opting to pay fixed instalments over 10 years equal to stamp duty and interest, with a government-facilitated transition loan. “Business and industry have told us they want this reform and we’ve listened. These landmark changes will enable businesses to be more dynamic and agile, and to grow and employ more workers,” Pallas said in a statement on Tuesday. “We’re removing barriers to larger investments, accelerating business growth and helping our economy grow even stronger.” On Monday night, the government announced it would deliver a $1bn surplus in 2025/26 – an improvement on the $900m forecast in the pre-election update in November – and another $1.2bn surplus the following financial year. But it did not confirm the figures for the 2023/24 or 2024/25 financial years or release information regarding the state’s total debt, which was forecast in November to surge from $116bn in 2022/23 to $166bn by 2025/26. The deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, said on Monday measures to pay down the Covid debt would not impact families. “This will not be something placed on hardworking families who’ve already gone through a really difficult 12 months with 11 interest rate rises,” she said. The budget will also include $140m for Aboriginal-led children and family services, which the premier, Daniel Andrews, vowed to reform immediately after he was sworn in for a third term in December. The sector has also recently been scrutinised by the state’s truth telling commission. The package includes $64m to expand the Aboriginal Children in Care program which will ensure more than 750 additional First Nations children can be included."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2023/may/22/newcastle-champions-league-eddie-howe","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T22:11:11Z","webTitle":"Newcastle’s transformation and reconnection testament to Howe’s coaching | Andy Brassell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/newcastle-champions-league-eddie-howe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/newcastle-champions-league-eddie-howe","fields":{"headline":"Transformation of Newcastle a huge testament to Eddie Howe’s coaching","bodyText":"The roar at kick-off, the roar that had been there in most of the previous 18 home games of this season, was maybe given a few extra decibels here. Added to renewed hope, present all season, was a touch of yes, this really is happening. Then came the moment, with fireworks being wedged into the tops of milk bottles, at the beginning of stoppage time, when Nick Pope was finally forced into some sort of movement to deny Timothy Castagne, to make sure it did happen. It came after one of the Newcastle keeper’s slowest days of the season, after what had often resembled a half-pitch, beat-the-packed-defence training exercise against a Leicester team largely too meek to threaten Geordie dreams. After the opening roar at St James’ often comes the hush, the tension that describes how much it means in this city. It fell over the stadium after Brighton’s Deniz Undav pulled a goal back here last Thursday night, but this is the way of things here now. That blanket of quiet used to fall over this stadium as a portent of impending calamity. Now it rolls in because there is something to lose. Because there is hope. That’s what it was always about in Newcastle. If any potential sense of wonder at a gatecrasher to the established order is tempered by misgivings over the club’s ownership in the wider football supporting community, it is not a sentiment widely shared here. In a city that often feels misunderstood by the world outside, it was never about pipe dreams of seeing Kylian Mbappé or Neymar posing for the cameras, stottie in hand. It was about finding a way out from the reviled Mike Ashley. It was about reconnecting with their club. The transformation on the pitch has, likewise, been about care and attention to detail rather than sweeping, grand gestures. While Bruno Guimarães, Kieran Trippier and latterly Alexander Isak have been major contributors, the real triumph of this season (as with the last) has been in Eddie Howe’s coaching – authentically coaching, improving players who looked perfect only for treading water just above the relegation line. That Fabian Schär, Miguel Almirón, Joe Willock and company have become decisive players is a huge testament to the work of Howe and his team. As they crammed into those 52,152 precious places – some of which they were literally giving away in the dark, not-so-distant past of the Ashley reign – minds started to wander to next season, even if this one has been good enough to linger long in the mind. Where might it be? Milan? Madrid? As Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds sauntered out of the tannoy before kick-off, thoughts of an overnight boat trip to Amsterdam sprang to mind, should Ajax make it. That is another one of those pinch-me aspects to all this. Newcastle have qualified for the Champions League ahead of the Dutch giants, who might not manage it – waiting, working and hoping like Milan, Inter, Marseille and the rest. It’s going to take a while to absorb. Sat in the front rooms of Longbenton, Gateshead, Gosforth and Coxlodge in late August, these will be a rare set of supporters not shouting at the television telling Uefa to get on with it. They will want to savour every second. On those longed-for Champions League nights this game will quickly fade from the memory, a necessary routine check of photo ID and boarding pass before getting on the flight to glory. If the celebration was to be savoured by these fans this was tough for a set of weary players, who had given everything and more four days before against Brighton and looked dead on their feet at the end of it. It had been a surprise to see Joelinton, one of those who paid the highest physical toll in that game, in the XI named here and he pulled up in the warmup, to be replaced by Elliot Anderson. The woodwork may not have wanted to play ball with the stands wanting their gala ending denying Callum Wilson, Almirón and Guimarães. No matter. In contrast with those hardy travelling fans, gamely chanting ‘Leicester ‘til I die’ from up on level seven, Newcastle’s faithful are no longer seeing their beloved team stymied by neglect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/dominic-raab-will-reportedly-stand-down-as-mp-at-next-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T21:34:37Z","webTitle":"Dominic Raab to stand down as MP at next election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/dominic-raab-will-reportedly-stand-down-as-mp-at-next-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/dominic-raab-will-reportedly-stand-down-as-mp-at-next-election","fields":{"headline":"Dominic Raab to stand down as MP at next election","bodyText":"Dominic Raab will stand down as an MP at the next general election, weeks after he quit Rishi Sunak’s cabinet over bullying claims. The former deputy prime minister, who had once been regarded as a potential leader of the Conservative party, resigned last month after a report on allegations of bullying found he had been “unreasonably aggressive”. After being elected in 2010, he had risen to serve twice as deputy prime minister and was foreign secretary during the botched evacuation from Afghanistan in 2021. He was heavily criticised for being on holiday as the extraction got under way. In a letter seen by the Daily Telegraph between Raab and the chair of his local Conservative Association he said he was concerned about the effect his being a frontline politician was having on his family. His Esher and Walton constituency is thought to be vulnerable to a resurgent Liberal Democrat party at the next general election. He has a slender 2,743 majority, and the area in Surrey is among Ed Davey’s top targets. The letter said: “I have become increasingly concerned over the last few years about the pressure the job has placed on my young family.” The newspaper reports that his sons Joshua and Peter are eight and 10 respectively. The 49-year-old had entered the cabinet as the Brexit secretary under Theresa May, succeeding his former boss David Davis. He, like Davis, later resigned over differences about the withdrawal agreement. Raab himself had been tipped to one day lead the Tories, most notably by diarist, Sasha Swire, who nicknamed him “Raab C Brexit” after fictional Glaswegian Rab C Nesbitt. He got his chance when May resigned, and he unsuccessfully stood in the ensuing election. Sasha Swire’s husband, Hugo Swire, then an MP and now a peer, coordinated his campaign, and he received the high-profile endorsement of Davis but was eliminated in the second ballot of Tory MPs. The victor in that summer’s race, Boris Johnson, made him his foreign secretary and first secretary of state – de facto Johnson’s deputy. The advent of the Covid pandemic less than a year later and Johnson’s hospital admission meant Raab was in charge while his boss was in intensive care. After Johnson returned to work, Raab continued as foreign secretary. He was at the helm when the British and US withdrawal from Afghanistan began in earnest, and the Taliban swept through the country, capturing the capital. Raab was on holiday in Crete at the time of the crisis and was criticised for not doing enough to assist the evacuation efforts, delaying decision-making. He had said he was working rather than holidaying in Crete. He was reshuffled to become deputy prime minister and justice secretary, being one of the few cabinet members who stayed loyal to Johnson in his final days in office, while others resigned and urged him to go. He declined to stand for leadership again in both contests in 2022, having a brief spell on the backbenches during Liz Truss’ premiership before returning to both roles under Rishi Sunak. However rumours had persisted in Westminster about Raab’s conduct and behaviour towards his staff. In 2022 Ministry of Justice sources told the Guardian that he had been “demeaning rather than demanding” towards staff and had been “very rude and aggressive”. “[He] wasn’t just unprofessional, he was a bully,” one said. Further stories followed until Sunak appointed an independent investigator to examine bullying claims. At the time he said he would “respect whatever outcome”, but when the report by Adam Tolley KC was published, Raab told the Telegraph it was “Kafkaesque” and said it had set a “dangerous precedent”. He now becomes the latest high-profile Tory to announce he will not contest the next election. The former chancellor Sajid Javid, the former health secretary Matt Hancock and the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries have all said they will be leaving the Commons. • This article was amended on 23 May 2023.

Today’s wannabe spies are more likely to ask for something else: permission to work from home – a cultural shift that has hit recruitment figures for Germany’s intelligence service. The president of the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) has said that finding enough staff was proving difficult as older members of the service retired and left, meaning there were not enough replacements. Bruno Kahl said: “We cannot offer certain conditions that are taken for granted today.” He described finding enough of the right staff as a growing challenge. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the tales of real and fictional espionage involving tradecraft such as dead drops, brush pasts and microdot photography, there is limited scope for carrying out espionage from your spare bedroom, even in 2023. “Remote work is barely possible at the BND for security reasons, and not being able to take your cell phone to work is asking much from young people looking for a job,” Kahl said, according to Reuters. About 6,500 people work for the BND, according to its homepage. The service was founded in 1956 in West Germany during the cold war and remained intact after reunification in 1989. East Germany’s foreign intelligence department, the HVA, was wound up. It has courted controversy in recent decades for working closely with the US before the invasion of Iraq, and for spying on journalists in Germany. Yet despite the preconception about life in the field, the problem does not appear to be shared by other intelligence agencies. Its UK counterpart tells potential applicants on its careers website that it offers “flexible working [which] means you can work around personal commitments”. Meanwhile the CIA said it has “several working groups” looking at working from home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/succession-recap-season-four-episode-nine-what-happened-to-romans-pre-grieving","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T21:15:45Z","webTitle":"Succession recap: season four, episode nine – what happened to Roman’s ‘pre-grieving’?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/succession-recap-season-four-episode-nine-what-happened-to-romans-pre-grieving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/succession-recap-season-four-episode-nine-what-happened-to-romans-pre-grieving","fields":{"headline":"Succession recap: season four, episode nine – what happened to Roman’s ‘pre-grieving’?","bodyText":"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Succession season four. Don’t read on unless you’ve watched episode nine. As if their father’s funeral would stop the sibs fighting for supremacy. Here’s your order of service for the penultimate episode, titled Church and State … ‘Discord make my dick hard’ It was Election Boxing Day and aftershocks were spreading from ATN anointing “alt-right” Jeryd Mencken (Justin Kirk) as president-elect. Protesters had taken to the streets nationwide. There were violent demonstrations outside ATN HQ. Inside, Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) pored over newspaper reports going “behind the controversial call”. Poor Decision Desk Darwin’s career looked over. “Jamming his head in the bosom of history,” Roman (Kieran Culkin) smirked with satisfaction at the ratings-boosting chaos he’d wreaked. Practising his eulogy, he stroked the stubbly goatee he’d grown especially (“Don’t I perhaps remind you of him, just a little?”) and gloated: “I selected the president. See his pecker in my pocket?” At least it was a good day to bury bad news. Pant-suited avenger Shiv (Sarah Snook) encouraged techbro Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård) to release a statement about GoJo’s inflated south Asian subscriber numbers. Like she’d predicted, it barely caused a ripple amid the riots. As shops were boarded up and gilets jaunes went on the rampage, it hit doubly close to home for Kendall (Jeremy Strong). Despite his petulant threats, ex-wife Rava (Natalie Gold) took their children upstate for safety, missing their grandfather’s funeral. PA Jess (Juliana Canfield) resigned, which Kendall took equally well (“You’re being juvenile and dumb,” pot told kettle). His complicity in Mencken’s rise to power was biting him in the backside. No wonder he felt “Queasy Gonzales”. Money changers in the temple In the funeral limo, Shiv told her brothers she was pregnant. Kendall asked if it was Tom’s. Roman’s reaction was even less charming: “Is it mine? So you’re having a Wambsgland. I thought you’d just been eating your feelings.” With tensions between the trio still high, Kendall tried to call a truce for the day. No chance. At the opulent uptown church, cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) was put on “Ewan watch”, ensuring Logan’s embittered older brother (James Cromwell) didn’t cause a scene. Again, no chance. What’s death if not a networking opportunity? Vibrating with nervous energy, Roman schmoozed board members to “rally around the orphans”. Keen to reposition herself in the new political landscape, Shiv was also on manoeuvres. When Matsson arrived, aiming to persuade “the handsome nazi” not to block the buyout, she pitched her idea: install an American CEO to placate concerns about foreign ownership. “Know who’d be good?” she twinkled. “Shiv Roy.” Determined not to let pregnancy obstruct her ambition, she half-joked that she’d be “one of those hard bitches who take 36 hours of maternity leave, emailing through her vanity caesarean, poor kid will never see her”. Pop would be proud, Pinkie. Scottish widows “Thought I could hear dalmatians howling,” said Shiv as her monstrous mother made a gloriously toxic return. Logan’s second wife Lady Caroline Collingwood (scene-stealer Harriet Walter) arrived with plus-one Peter Munion (Pip Torrens) in tow. Lady C sneered that her social-climbing husband had “brought his autograph book” and was “rolling around like a labrador in a lovely pile of senators”. She immediately rumbled Shiv’s pregnancy, feigning offence that she wasn’t forewarned rather than offering congratulations. Unfailingly nicer to people outside her own family, Lady Caroline sweetly invited Logan’s mistress Kerry (Zoë Winters) to join her on the front row – alongside chic merry widow Marcia (Hiam Abbass) and the legendary Sally-Anne (Nicole Ansari Cox – yes, actor Brian’s real-life wife). “Sally-Anne was my Kerry, so to speak,” said Lady Caroline. “All water under the bridge now.” Logan’s women sitting shoulder-to-shoulder was a lovely touch, not least when they girl-bonded over Logan’s nocturnal teeth-grinding and when Marcia silently comforted tearful Kerry. Give this quartet their own spin-off. Four paeans at a funeral Fair to say it was a mixed bag of eulogies. Brushing off Greg, Ewan insisted on speaking. His five-minute valediction was less of a tribute than a takedown. Logan had “wrought the most terrible things” and “appealed to men’s worst instincts”. Ewan did provide answers to a tragedy that’s long been alluded to. Their younger sister Rose died of polio and schoolboy Logan blamed himself for bringing it home. No wonder Rose was such a touchy subject. Time for Roman to redress the balance, except he hadn’t “pre-grieved” at all. He stumbled up the steps. He fiddled nervously with his mic and cue cards. Shaken by the proximity of his father’s coffin, his bravado fell away to reveal a little boy lost. As he beckoned his siblings and broke down, keening with grief, it was a heartbreaking moment. Kendall filled in and went freestyle (why didn’t he rap it?). Like his Living+ presentation, it began shakily but grew in confidence. Yes, his father was a brute but he had vim and vitality. He built things, making money and jobs with his “magnificent, awful force”. Never more Michael Corleone, Kendall received rapturous applause. Last up, Shiv said her piece. Sure, her father shut people out but “when he let you in, the sun shone and it was warm in the light”. It was hard being Logan’s daughter (“he couldn’t fit a whole woman in his head”) but she bade farewell to her “dear world of a father”. Roman had faux-joked about who’d “win the funeral”. As Kendall accepted handshakes and backslaps, the result was clear. Godspeed and God bless. Cat food Ozymandias At the internment, Connor (Alan Ruck) proudly showed off the mausoleum Logan bought from “a dotcom pet supplies guy” for a bargain “five mil”. There was room for them all. Con fancied “a top bunk”. Ken balked at spending eternity with his father, since he “had trouble finishing a Scotch with him”. Roman couldn’t even cross the threshold (“he made me breathe funny”) or watch the casket get carried in. Seeking reassurance, Shiv asked the greybeards: “How bad was Dad?” “He was a salty dog but a good egg,” said Frank (Peter Friedman). “What you saw was what you got,” added Karl (David Rasche). Well played, Statler and Waldorf. Comms chief Hugo (Fisher Stevens) told Kendall that GoJo were touting Shiv as US CEO. Galvanised, Kendall rallied supporters to his side. He instructed Hugo to brief the media that Matsson’s acquisition undervalued the firm and didn’t have board support. He even offered Logan’s hangdog former bodyguard Colin (Scott Nicholson) a job. Well, he knows where the waiter’s bodies are buried. A wake is a long time in politics At the aftershow, power-hungry hyenas descended on Mencken. Kendall offered “congratulations, pending a gruelling constitutional knife fight”. Alarm bells rang when “Hocus Potus” only said he’d “try” to help halt the GoJo sale. While Con and Greg interrupted the grownups infuriatingly, Shiv spirited Mencken away to meet Matsson. The Odin of Coding offered him a choice: “Two tiny men in your pocket” or social media’s “gateway to broad and growing cultural influence”? Afterwards, Matsson jubilantly phoned Shiv to say, “It’s a yes!” and “I think they’re interested”. Shiv’s jubilant response? “Let’s make a meatball burger.” Tom finally arrived, exhausted and apologetic. “You’d never have dared not come to his funeral when he was alive,” said Shiv. When Tom wept about saying goodbye to Logan on the plane, she softened and sent him to their apartment to sleep. They couldn’t salvage their marriage, could they? The “CEO-bros” huddled. Roman had “tried to dad it” but a naive lack of leverage meant Mencken had welched on their deal. Kendall admitted he was also to blame but he had a plan. They’d fight the sale at board level. However, visibly shrunken Romulus had become a laughing stock. Mencken called him “the grim weeper” and “Tiny Tears”. A clip of his crying was circulating. “He sounds like a sow that’s about to get the stun gun and knows it,” said Karl. Too soon. Roman strode out into the night and masochistically goaded the marauding protesters into punching him. Top dog to rock bottom in a day. The heir apparent Neck-and-neck between Shiv and Kendall going into the home stretch. Roman looks out of the running. Much now depends on the board (Stewy, this is your moment) and the two mercurial Ms, Matsson and Mencken. Line of the week I enjoyed Roman imagining the reactions to his eulogy: “See Shivvy cry, see Kenny die, see Roman the showman light up the sky.” Yet Shiv’s summation of Logan steals the prize: “My dad had deep ocean currents swirling in his gut but on specifics, he was about money, winning and gossip.” Amen. Notes and observations HBO filmed fake scenes of Brian Cox arriving at the funeral as a decoy, so rubberneckers wouldn’t twig it was Logan who’d died. This episode and the next reunite the Succession A-team of writer Jesse Armstrong and director Mark Mylod, responsible for 13 of the show’s 39 episodes overall. I’d love to know the contents of Connor’s unread eulogy, which was “formally inventive” and would leave the family “open to legal action”. Only one episode to go. Next week’s finale is a feature-length 90 minutes. Buckle up, fuckleheads. A less frantic, fittingly meditative episode left us agonisingly poised. “Roy Boys versus Shiv the Shiv”, anyone? Rejoin us next Monday for one last time. Until then, sadfaces, please leave your thoughts below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/once-upon-a-time-in-northern-ireland-review-civil-war-rages-before-your-very-eyes","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T21:15:45Z","webTitle":"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland review – civil war rages before your very eyes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/once-upon-a-time-in-northern-ireland-review-civil-war-rages-before-your-very-eyes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/once-upon-a-time-in-northern-ireland-review-civil-war-rages-before-your-very-eyes","fields":{"headline":"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland review – civil war rages before your very eyes","bodyText":"James Bluemel has said that his new project, Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland, is not intended to be comprehensive in its analysis of the Troubles, since it comprises five hour-long episodes – not enough time to untangle decades of hurt, resentment and eventual reconciliation. Instead, it hunts, successfully, for the telling details that come from first-hand recollections and deftly chosen archive clips. The series runs chronologically, the interviewees returning across multiple episodes, their stories taking time to develop and interlock. Episode one covers 1968-72, a formative period during which most of the personal narratives barely begin; it’s often not clear even what role the person speaking played. What the opening instalment does offer is a strong impression of how quickly injustice and difference can descend into extreme violence. In 1968, fissures that had been built into the creation of Northern Ireland began to open wide. The civil rights movement saw Catholics rise up to protest against poor housing, as well as an iniquity that is startling to modern eyes. The right to vote in local elections was tied to home ownership, a rule that disproportionately disfranchised Catholics. The programme uses testimonies to show how such divisive policies can erode what ought to be strong class solidarity. After a Catholic remembers gazing east across the Foyle river in Derry at the nicer-looking houses on the other side, a Protestant recalls hearing Catholic complaints about having limited job prospects and making do with outside toilets: “I said: ‘That’s me. We’ve got nothing either.’ We were just working class.” Such people were already caught up in a culture war, embodied by the Protestant minister (and future first minister) Ian Paisley. “Romanism has bred poverty and ignorance and priestcraft and superstition!” he is seen saying in one of his full-volume speeches. One of the programme’s interviewees, a Protestant, remembers his father insisting that the civil rights movement was nothing but a front for the IRA, with an inflammatory headline in a local paper offered as proof. Catholic demonstrations were met with batons and water cannon, causing protesters to return brandishing clubs and sticks, the violent tensions coming to a head with the Battle of the Bogside in Derry in August 1969. A series well attuned to how blackly funny old news footage can be shows us a British reporter on the ground, interrupted by a flying chunk of masonry just as he tells viewers that he is in “Londonderry”. But the subsequent arrival of the British army on the streets of Northern Ireland changed everything. Real horror was to come, but not yet. We see jarringly sunny film of men in uniform being handed trays of tea and sandwiches by grateful members of both communities. Tom, who arrived in Northern Ireland as a teenage soldier, speaks of Catholic and Protestant women competing to ply him with the most goodies. Ultimately, though, those troops were there to serve a British government that was aligned with one side. Rather than show a descent towards civil war, the episode skips to 1971 to demonstrate how much changed in two years. Another news clip features Martin Bell inside a Catholic house, thoroughly trashed by troops on the premise of searching for weapons. In the present day, a Catholic interviewee sums up the shift: “These weren’t the same people that I was handing biscuits to. They were angry.” Natural as it is to narrow one’s eyes when the phrase “both sides” pops up in situations involving state violence, Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland follows through on its promise to hear both halves of the story as well as it can. Ricky, a Catholic, admits that some of those who joined the IRA before him had always been committed to armed struggle and were delighted to see the British troops arrive. Tom provides the army perspective, aided by the programme showing an archive interview with him, as well as him speaking now. After the introduction of internment – the indiscriminate mass detention of those deemed to be potential combatants – the young Tom expresses confusion at no longer being offered cakes in Catholic neighbourhoods. The older Tom isn’t embarrassed to see himself saying “I don’t like Irish Catholics”; that forthright young man would later be seriously injured by a nail bomb. How did that make him see the people who planted the explosives? “Nothing more than terrorists.” The episode concludes with grim footage of Bloody Sunday: 30 January 1972, when a Derry civil rights march ended with 14 people being killed by British soldiers. This was a politically pivotal event, but here the most impactful moment is old film of a grieving wife or mother at the funeral, howling: “Ohhh, I loved you,” in unfettered, almost lyrical despair. By marking how the Troubles affected individuals, Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland finds profound wider truths. • Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland was broadcast on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2023/may/22/newcastle-united-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live-score-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T21:09:50Z","webTitle":"Newcastle United 0-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/may/22/newcastle-united-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live-score-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2023/may/22/newcastle-united-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live-score-updates","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle United 0-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s me done. Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. Until next time! Ta ra! Leicester rode their luck, but you have to give Dean Smith and co a lot of credit. There were a lot of raised eyebrows at his team selection – leaving out Barnes and Maddison – but this point at Newcastle could potentially be season-defining. They need to beat West Ham on the final day to stay up, but that is very doable, with the Hammers preparing for a European final on 7 June. \\ That point also means that Leicester are now only relying on Everton not beating Bournemouth, not the result of Leeds, who are now 19th on goal difference. Hope that makes sense! Sean Longstaff: If you told us two years ago that this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have believed you. Kieran Trippier: It means everything. I took a risk when I came here but I believed in the club. They have been through some tough times, but now they reap the rewards. Newcastle have qualified for the Champions League! Leicester rise to 18th, and could yet escape relegation on the final day! 90+5 min: Both sides seem content with a draw. 90+4 min: Pope rushes out to collect a dangerous Leicester through ball, with Barnes lurking. Excellent goalkeeping from the England international, who has had virtually nothing to do all night up until this point. 90+2 min: Longstaff catches Maddison and suddenly Leicester have a dangerous free-kick on the right wing. The ball eventually comes into the box … chance for Castagne! Save from Pope! The Belgian hooks a volley towards goal, and Pope dives to his right to parry the ball out. Burn is there to hack the ball away. Leicester’s first attempt on goal, and it was nearly the winner. A really good save! 90 min: Poor pass from Schar and Tripper is forced to bring Barnes down, to stop a dangerous Leicester counter-attack. Momentum has definitely shifted here! Newcastle now look like they are holding on for a point. Five minutes added on for injury time. 89 min: Both sides make changes: Newcastle introduce Gordon for Almiron, while Leicester bring on Mendy for Ndidi, who looks like he’s got a knock of some type. 88 min: Leicester thrice win the ball back high up the pitch, and press forward! Tielemens tries to play Barnes in on goal, and only a crucial block from Schar stops Leicester from having a golden chance! 86 min: Leicester are passing the ball. I’m shocked the away end are not chanting ‘olé!’ Whisper it, but Newcastle look … nervous! Suddenly the crowd are wary of their side blowing it. 84 min: Leicester are yet to have a shot. The last time a Premier League team failed to do that in a game was back in 2019, with Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth. 82 min: Watching replays of that Guimaraes miss. It is absolutely extraordinary. 80 min: Leicester’s time-wasting has started. And who can blame them? 78 min: Another Newcastle change: Murphy is on for Anderson. Almiron goes into the No 10 role, and Murphy goes to the right. You can’t fault Howe for not trying things. But credit to Leicester. They have been lucky, but also been well organised. Which is in stark contrast to recent performances. 76 min: Iversen makes another save and this one is a good one! Longstaff breaks into the box, collects a clever Tripper pass, and fires through a crowd of Leicester bodies. Iversen falls the ball, and uses his feet to shovel the ball away. Another wave of attack is repelled. 74 min: Newcastle have now had 20 attempts on goal, but only three of these have hit the target. Iversen has only really been tested once, from that fierce Isak drive. 72 min: Newcastle hit the woodwork for the third time! From a home corner, Faes so nearly scores (another) own goal, glancing his header towards the back post. Guimaraes is completely free and only has to head the ball into an empty net, but the Brazilian seems scared of heading the post, and half-pulls out of his header. Instead, it is the ball that ricochets off the post, and Leicester hack it away. Still 0-0! 70 min: A win is obviously preferable, especially for Leicester, but a draw isn’t the worst result for both sides. Here is the table, as things stand. Leicester up to 18th, Newcastle securing Champions League football. 68 min: Newcastle respond with a change of their own: Wilson off for Saint-Maximin. Isak will move to the centre, and Saint-Maximin will slot in on the left. Wilson was very quiet tonight, after his red-hot run of form. 66 min: Leicester do at least look like they carry a threat with the pace of Barnes and Daka. But will it disrupt Leicester’s defensive shape? I am predicting a late Newcastle winner (1-0). 64 min: Leicester win a corner! Here we go! Barnes drives at Trippier, but the resulting corner doesn’t beat the first Newcastle defender. Ah. 63 min: Here come the changes: Barnes and Daka on, Evans and Vardy off. A change in shape then, Leicester are going to four at the back. 62 min: Twice Isak is denied: Souttar bravely dives in front to block the Swede’s shot, and then Isak gets to the byline but is crowded out by a hoard of defenders in blue. 60 min: Two-thirds of the game gone. Dean Smith will be pleased but it looks as though he is readying changes: Barnes and Daka are getting their kit off. 59 min: Iversen saves to deny Isak! Almiron cuts inside and rolls the ball square to Isak on the edge of the box … his powerful shot is saved by the Leicester keeper, who didn’t have to dive too far to his left, but judged the power of the shot well. 57 min: Leicester’s low block is working. Newcastle are not exactly being incisive. They are lacking a proper No 10, to find the half-spaces between the lines. 54 min: Evans is down, clutching his hamstring or groin. Eeeesssh, not good news for Leicester, who desperately need their veteran defender to continue. It looks as though he’s going to soldier on. 52 min: I’d be surprised to see Isak on the left for much longer. He is such a threat aerially, and somebody like Gordon or Saint-Maximin could do a fine job on the left flank, with Isak more centrally alongside Wilson. 49 min: Once again, it’s attack versus defence as the home side pour forward. 47 min: Isak carries the ball from the half-way line all the way along the left touchline and wins a Newcastle corner. Leicester players have obviously watched that Isak assist against Everton. They are terrified of him. From the corner, Newcastle have a penalty shout as Almiron’s shot strikes Tielemens on the elbow, but the Belgian’s arm was not away from his body. No penalty. Peeeeeeep! We’re off for the second half. Leicester have made one change: Maddison is on, Iheanacho off. Half-time reading: Somehow it’s goalless. Can we say that Dean Smith’s gameplan is working? 45+2 min: “I remember first time I saw Howe’s Bournemouth team live I was amazed to find they were as “professional” as a Big Sam era Bolton team”, emails Will Cook. “Now Howe is at Newcastle with money I look forward to him creating Atlético Newcastle, it’s what the Premier League has been missing since Mourinho’s Chelsea, a baddy team, a Darth Vadar.” 45 min: Three minutes of injury time added on for Leicester to survive. Their xG is currently zero. 44 min: Iverson having a mare! From a Newcastle corner, the Leicester keeper flaps at a Trippier cross but doesn’t get anywhere near it. Wilson is free at the back post and only has to head into an empty net, but he heads over! 42 min: Newcastle hit the post again! How are the home side not ahead?! The ball falls kindly to Almiron in the box, the Paraguayan volleys a bouncing shot against the post. It comes out to Isak on the penalty box, but he can only shoot wide. Both Newcastle players should really have done better! Iverson was motionless for both shots. Get the ball on target and it would surely have been a goal. 40 min: Wilson hits the post! And Ndidi clears the rebound off the line! Leicester suddenly hanging on here, after some awful goalkeeping from Iversen. The Dane drops the ball at the feet of Wilson, who swivels and can only hit the inside of the post from an acute angle. Evans shovels the ball away with a boot but the ball only finds Wilson’s head, which loops the ball back towards the Leicester net, before Ndidi – standing on his own goalline – finally clears the ball behind. 38 min: Schar tries his luck from range, but the ball ends closer to the away fans than the goal. Think Schar would make the Premier League Handsome XI. Great cheekbones and superb salt/pepper ratio. 36 min: Souttar is doing what he was brought in (and bought in) to do. Head the ball away. Wilson hasn’t had any luck so far against the 6ft6in Australian. Yet. 34 min: For the first time in the match, Leicester look comfortable. They can’t get a kick. But they don’t look like they are going to fold like a house of cards. 32 min: “This match is backwards,” emails Justin Kavanagh. “The Magpies are trying to outfox the Foxes by breaking down their deep burrow, while the Foxes need to snatch a valuable point or three from the Magpies’ nest.” 30 min: It’s not been pretty, but Leicester have got through a third of the match without conceding. In fact, Iversen has not had a meaningful save to make in the Leicester goal. They have conceded at least one goal in the first half in each of their last eight games, so getting to half-time with a clean sheet is of huge importance to the away side. 27 min: Isak hobbles off, with Saint-Maximin and Gordon waiting in the wings, but it does look like the No 14 is going to continue, aided by some strapping just below his left knee. 25 min: Isak is booked for a mis-timed challenge on a counter-attacking Castagne. It is actually the Swede that has injured himself, and Newcastle’s physios rush on to tend to the striker. 23 min: Re my preamble, do not underestimate the importance of pettiness in football. 21 min: Newcastle have had 81% possession. 18 min: This won’t shock anyone, but Leicester have no width with Barnes and Tete on the bench. Vardy and Iheanacho are so isolated, even when they have the ball. Nobody is running beyond them, so they are forced to retreat and then pump it long for Burn, Botman and Schar to gobble up. 15 min: Isak on the left, and Almiron on the right and causing Castagne and Thomas some serious problems. Almiron cuts in on that right foot but lifts his shot over the bar. 12 min: Regarding that Guimaraes ‘tackle’, we have an email from Will Morgan. “That is a horrific challenge. I’m very confused as to why that’s not been upgraded to red. Very, very poor from VAR.” It would have been a harsh red, but we’ve seen them given. Don’t think it had the intent to be a sending-off though, was more on the clumsy side. 10 min: It’s attack versus defence at the momen, as waves of Newcastle attacks crash against the Leicester defence. The away side are holding firm, for the moment, but you wonder how many Trippier and Almiron crosses this Leicester back four can take without conceding. Leicester have to carry more of a threat on the counter attack. 8 min: Yellow card for Guimaraes! The Newcastle one dangles a leg and pops his studs into Soumare’s knee. It was a tackle with little force, a waft rather than a stamp or a slide, but still very high. Some of Leicester’s bench are calling for a red card, but VAR check it and are happy with a booking. It’s the right call, in my opinion. 6 min: Rather than operating as a front two, Isak is loitering on the left flank. He plays a neat one-two with Anderson, and sprints in behind Castagne before whipping a dangerous low cross, which is well cleared by Thomas. 4 min: Leicester are going Route One! That’s brave against a Newcastle back four that includes Burn, Botman and Schar. How Sunday League of Leicester. Get them turned! 2 min: Burn tries a cross-field ball to Tripper, but bins it out for a Leicester throw-in. The away side will look to feed off scraps tonight, press high with Vardy and Iheanacho, and try to win the game ugly. And we’re off! Newcastle in their famous black and white stripes, Leicester in their home blue. The teams are out, as are the tifos in the stands. We said St James’ Park would be rocking, and it is. Woof! Joelinton has been injured in the warm-up! Newcastle bring in Elliot Anderson for just his second Premier League start. The 20-year-old from Whitley Bay has looked rather special in the few games I have seen. Nobby Solano is at the ground tonight. I had completely forgotten that the Peruvian also played for Leicester. Assuming that Newcastle do make the top four, it will be fascinating to see what moves they make in the transfer market. Will Eddie Howe stick with the players that have brought Champions League football back to St James’ Park? Probably not. This is tonight’s squad: Newcastle: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Almiron, Wilson, Isak. Subs: Dubravka, Dummett, Gordon, Saint-Maximin, Lewis, Targett, Murphy, Anderson, Miley. It would not be a surprise to see, with a few exceptions (Pope, Trippier, Guimaraes, Botman, Isak) the starting XI become next season’s bench, the bench sold to fund this summer’s signings. Dean Smith features heavily here. We need to be harder to beat. The last few games we’re trying to win, but watching Newcastle’s last few games, they are so strong from set pieces and we wanted an extra centre back [Souttar]. The lads [Maddison and Barnes] are disappointed but I’d expect them to be. They see the bigger picture here. What’s interesting from those quotes is that Smith is not going all out for the win. A draw here tonight means Leicester would stay up with win over West Ham on the last day if Everton fail to beat Bournemouth. Certainly the first part of that equation – Leicester beating West Ham – seems very likely. Despite Leicester’s woeful form, West Ham have a European final to prepare for on 7 June, and it would not be a shock to see David Moyes rest a few key faces. Also, there will be a few West Ham players that will want to avoid injury, with such an important game to come. A lot of ifs/buts/maybes, there. But I think Leicester going for a draw tonight, rather than trying to go toe-to-toe with Newcastle, is quite smart. Risky, of course, as Everton could easily beat Bournemouth. What a huge call from Dean Smith to leave his two most talented players on the bench, just the second time this season that neither player has featured for the Foxes. Interestingly, Leicester only win in the last 14 leagues games came against Wolves, when neither Maddison or Barnes played. And it looks like a change in formation, Leicester lining up in a 3-5-2, or a 5-3-2, depending on how you look at it. Newcastle: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Almiron, Wilson, Isak. Subs: Dubravka, Dummett, Gordon, Saint-Maximin, Lewis, Targett, Murphy, Anderson, Miley. Leicester: Iversen, Castagne, Faes, Evans, Thomas, Ndidi, Souttar, Soumare, Tielemans, Iheanacho, Vardy. Subs: Barnes, Maddison, Smithies, Kristiansen, Amartey, Daka, Mendy, Praet, Tete. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands) Ignoring the VERY important battle for Europa Conference League qualification (!), only six teams realistically have anything left to play for in the Premier League this season: Newcastle, Manchester United, Liverpool (competing for the top four) along with Everton, Leeds and Leicester (fighting to avoid the drop). Leicester – deep, deep in the relegation mire – will count themselves rather unlucky to be playing the top-placed of these six teams in their penultimate game. Currently 19th, Leicester will jump out of the bottom three on goal difference with a win tonight but anything else means Everton will remain 17th heading into the final match. With the Merseyside club playing Bournemouth at home (and relegation candidates Leeds given the gift of Spurs at Elland Road on the final day), tonight is an absolutely pivotal game for the 2015-16 champions to get ahead while they still can. Leicester’s chances of getting a result at St James’ Park this evening are severely hindered by Newcastle’s own ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League – the Magpies only need one more point to be sure of a top-four finish, which will bring a transformative boost for the club’s coffers and act as a tasty carrot for prospective summer signings. St James’ Park is going to be absolutely rocking under the lights, and Geordies will feel confident of getting the point they need – only Manchester United have conceded fewer goals at home, and Leicester haven’t won away from home since the 4 February. That said, the away side are used to beating the odds. It would be very Jamie Vardy for the Leicester striker to go and spoil Newcastle’s party.

Now the indefatigable Jones returns to the small screen (between the last series of Gentleman Jack and the second series of Vigil, arriving shortly) in the new ITV drama Maryland, directed by another former soap star, Susan Tully (Michelle Fowler, from the days when EastEnders was great in every way). Jones, who co-created Maryland with writer Anne Marie O’Connor, co-stars with Eve Best, who is one of the many faces here (Hugh Quarshie and Dean Lennox Kelly foremost among them) who make you cry: “Oh my God – yes! Why is this person not on my television more?!” Maryland opens like a thriller, with a dead body discovered on a lonely stretch of beach on the Isle of Man and, soon after that, a woman taking delivery of a large package of smuggled drugs. This is a slightly unfortunate misdirection because it is not a thriller at all, but a chamber piece about family dynamics, female identity and ways of finding freedom before it is too late. The period of expectation-adjustment is a waste, but once get your eye in, it is a joy. The body is that of Mary, the mother of Becca (Jones) and Rosaline (Best). They thought she was on holiday in Wales with her friend Maureen and are baffled as well as grief-stricken when they are given the news and have to fly to the island to begin the repatriation process. The sisters have grown apart over the years, as often happens with siblings. This is partly because they have gone down different paths: Becca married young and is now in the thick of family life with two teenagers and Rosaline is devoted to her career, though she keeps a toyboy around who is happy to be called on in her moments of leisure. It is also partly because of their childhood history, which is gradually revealed, and the effects that traumatic events can have. Again, it is not a thriller; we are talking about ordinary trauma, not murder or kidnapping or anything. But it is all the more affecting for that, as is the fact that the sisters clearly still love each other and that – like all of us – they have accreted stuff between them that needs clearing away. Their mother’s death acts as a catalyst for, and a distraction from, such an undertaking, as they come to realise that Mary had been leading a double life for years. Unbeknownst to her children, Mary was adopted. She tracked down her biological mother to the Isle of Man and so began her secret visits there. When Mary’s mother died, she left her the house – which now passes to the girls – to be held in trust down the generations “for the betterment of the women in the family”. It is filled with pictures of the girls growing up and of Mary with her circle of friends in the community. They include a lover, the elegant, erudite Peter (Quarshie), who could not be more different from her decidedly inelegant and inerudite husband (and the girls’ father) Richard (George Costigan) back home, and Cathy – the woman we first saw thanking a man in a rowing boat for bringing her a boatful of marijuana. Cathy is played by Stockard Channing, who is a great actor but her wild energy is barely contained here and unbalances her scenes: it feels a bit like Elizabeth Taylor walking into a Rattigan play. Maryland’s greatest strength lies in the scenes between the sisters, as they bicker, laugh, cry, barrel through the revelations together in front of people, then fall apart when they are alone.

When Howe took charge here 19 months ago, Newcastle were 19th in the Premier League; courtesy of the point collected on Monday night they are now guaranteed a top-four finish. No matter that a very tired looking home side rather stumbled across the line. No matter that they needed to be grateful to the otherwise unemployed Nick Pope for saving Timothy Castagne’s high velocity stoppage time volley, the glittering prize of participation in next season’s Champions League is theirs. If many Tynesiders, mentally at least, appear already in the airport departure lounge, passports at the ready as, after a 20-year absence, they prepare for a series of European adventures, Leicester are contemplating the real possibility of slogging their way round England’s second tier outposts. The 2016 Premier League champions may not quite be relegated, not yet anyway, but their slender survival hopes are dependent on Everton failing to beat Bournemouth at Goodison Park on Sunday, while they also win, at home to West Ham. At least it will make a change for Leicester not to be playing on a Monday night. This was their fourth successive such fixture and Dean Smith, the interim manager, attempted to liven it up by beginning with his two brightest creative sparks on the substitutes’ bench. It meant James Maddison – a midfielder right at the top of Howe’s summer shopping list – and Harvey Barnes sat back and watched as Smith attempted to stave off relegation courtesy of a new-look, unexpectedly mean, back five featuring Jonny Evans at its heart. With Evans and Harry Souttar impressing that quintet deserves credit for maintaining a rare clean sheet. It possibly helped their cause that Leicester’s midfield did not have to contend with Joelinton after Howe’s Brazilian midfielder sustained an injury in the warm up, prefacing the way for Elliot Anderson to deputise. Meanwhile, Joelinton’s compatriot and midfield partner, Bruno Guimarães was perhaps a little fortunate to remain on the pitch after planting his studs in Boubakary Soumaré’s thigh in the 10th minute. That incident triggered a VAR review but, ultimately and contentiously, it was decided that the yellow card produced by Andre Marriner would suffice. The only trouble was that his players could not seem to loosen up sufficiently to faze Smith’s suddenly assured looking rearguard. With Newcastle missing their customary pressers in chief, the injured Joe Willock and Joelinton, they could not quite force their usually intense high tempo and Evans, Souttar and co duly second guessed repeated attacking manoeuvres. Whenever Howe’s players enter their trademark pre match huddles, England’s Kieran Trippier reminds his teammates that “pressure is a privilege” but it looked like the stress of having one foot on the European mainland was suddenly burdening a team starting to seem fatigued. Nonetheless, Leicester’s Wilfried Ndidi was required to clear Callum Wilson’s header off the line with Daniel Iversen beaten after the England striker’s original shot rebounded off the inside of a post as Newcastle forced repeated corners. Smith’s side lived dangerously once more when Miguel Almirón met Fabian Schär’s headed flick on the half volley before hitting a post but Alexander Isak could not quite direct the rebound on target. Leicester’s manager responded by pressing the tactical button marked “Maddison” at half-time, sending the attacking playmaker on for the second period in place of Kelechi Iheanacho. Along with several teammates Jamie Vardy’s supposed partner in crime had barely touched the ball during his time on the pitch but now Maddison was playing just behind Leicester’s No 9 and Schär and Sven Botman needed to be on their guard. Leicester’s problem was they rarely retained possession for long enough to stretch Howe’s centre halves. Instead they largely continued in backs-to-the-wall mode, surviving a VAR check for handball when Youri Tielemans blocked a shot from the increasingly influential Almirón. Iversen, who had earlier seemed a little shaky, came to the visiting rescue courtesy of a fabulous save to somehow tip Isak’s imperiously rising shot over the bar one handed. Significantly that chance was conjured by Almirón, a forward reborn under Howe’s tutelage. By now Smith had no real option bar indulging in a bit of risk-taking and, sure enough, he replaced Evans and Vardy with Harvey Barnes and Patson Daka as his side switched to a back four. With Guimarães heading against a post from a yard out that tactical rejig made little discernible difference until Pope’s sublime last-gasp save from Castagne left Smith emitting anguished expletives and Newcastle in wonderland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/morning-mail-bizarre-jobseeker-course-stan-grants-qa-farewell-beetaloos-climate-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T20:52:52Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: jobseeker course criticised; Stan Grant’s Q&A farewell; Beetaloo’s climate risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/morning-mail-bizarre-jobseeker-course-stan-grants-qa-farewell-beetaloos-climate-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/morning-mail-bizarre-jobseeker-course-stan-grants-qa-farewell-beetaloos-climate-risk","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: jobseeker course criticised; Stan Grant’s Q&A farewell; Beetaloo’s climate risk","bodyText":"Good morning.

The suit also argues the ban is pre-empted by federal law because it intrudes upon matters of exclusive federal concern and violates the commerce clause of the US constitution, which limits the authority of states to enact legislation that unduly burdens interstate and foreign commerce. “We are challenging Montana’s unconstitutional TikTok ban to protect our business and the hundreds of thousands of TikTok users in Montana,” the company said in the court filing. On Wednesday, Montana’s governor, Greg Gianforte, signed legislation that bans the app and prohibits the Google and Apple app stores from offering it within the state starting next year. The law would fine any “entity” – whether an app store or the social media company itself – for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access the platform or download the app. A group of TikTok creators had already sued to block the law, arguing it violates their first amendment rights. The state, the plaintiffs argued, seeks to “exercise powers over national security that Montana does not have and to ban speech Montana may not suppress”. The group included a former marine sergeant, an exercise influencer, a rancher and a small swimwear business. Gianforte has argued the law will “protect Montanans’ personal and private data from being harvested by the Chinese Communist party”. Montana’s ban comes amid increasing scrutiny of the Chinese-owned app over its ties to China. The company has denied that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and has said the company would not do so if asked. Still, Donald Trump in 2020 sought to bar new downloads of TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat, but a series of court decisions blocked the bans from taking effect. The federal government, and more than half of US states, have prohibited the app on government devices and the Biden administration has threatened a national ban unless its parent company sells its shares. TikTok is arguing Montana “banishes TikTok, and just TikTok, from the state for purely punitive reasons, as evidenced by the state’s decision to single out plaintiff for harsh penalties based on speculative concerns about TikTok’s data security and content moderation practices”. The suit names Montana’s attorney general, Austin Knudsen, who is charged with enforcing the law. Knudsen’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. TikTok has more than 100 million users in the US. It’s unclear how the ban would be enforced, with many ways for users to evade geographic bans.

The GOP’s presidential field is crowded and set to become more packed on Wednesday when Ron DeSantis makes his campaign official, but can anyone defeat the final boss of Republican politicians, Donald Trump? We’ll see. Here’s what else has happened today: Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy will meet at 5.30pm to (hopefully) resolve the debt ceiling standoff. The NAACP issued a travel advisory for Florida over policies DeSantis has pursued as governor, and which he will likely try to sell voters on in his presidential campaign. Mandatory water cuts were avoided in the west after the Biden administration and several states agreed to a deal regarding management of the Colorado river. Trump and fellow South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham both wished Scott well on his presidential bid. Speaking of Trump, federal prosecutors have evidence that he was warned he could not hold onto classified documents, the Guardian has confirmed. We’re 10 days away from 1 June, the estimated date when the US government, fresh out of cash and prohibited by the legal debt ceiling from borrowing more money, will default on its obligations for the first time in history. Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy are in the midst of negotiations over a deal to raise the limit, likely in exchange for spending cuts or the enactment of conservative priorities that the GOP has demanded. But it’s coming awfully close to the deadline, particularly since it takes several days for Congress to consider and vote on legislation, and there’s no telling who might object to whatever deal the Democratic president reaches with the Republican speaker of House. The Associated Press took a look at what might happen if Washington does the unthinkable and actually defaults, and reached a grim verdict: The repercussions of a first-ever default on the federal debt would quickly reverberate around the world. Orders for Chinese factories that sell electronics to the United States could dry up. Swiss investors who own U.S. Treasurys would suffer losses. Sri Lankan companies could no longer deploy dollars as an alternative to their own dodgy currency. “No corner of the global economy will be spared” if the U.S. government defaulted and the crisis weren’t resolved quickly, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Zandi and two colleagues at Moody’s have concluded that even if the debt limit were breached for no more than week, the U.S. economy would weaken so much, so fast, as to wipe out roughly1.5 million jobs. And if a government default were to last much longer — well into the summer — the consequences would be far more dire, Zandi and his colleagues found in their analysis: U.S. economic growth would sink, 7.8 million American jobs would vanish, borrowing rates would jump, the unemployment rate would soar from the current 3.4% to 8% and a stock-market plunge would erase $10 trillion in household wealth. Biden and McCarthy are set for a 5.30pm meeting at the White House for further talks on a debt limit agreement. In major news for western US states grappling with drought, the Guardian’s Oliver Milman reports that the Biden administration has agreed to a deal that will see them use less water from the Colorado river and ward off the prospect of mandatory water cuts: A deal has been struck by Joe Biden’s administration for California, Arizona and Nevada to take less water from the drought-stricken Colorado River, in a bid to prevent the river dwindling further and imperiling the water supplies for millions of people and vast swaths of agricultural land in the US west. The agreement, announced on Monday, will involve the three states, water districts, Native American tribes and farm operators cutting about 13% of the total water use in the lower Colorado basin, a historic reduction that will probably trigger significant water restrictions on the region’s residents and farmland. In all, 3m acre-feet of water is expected to be conserved over the next three years – an acre-foot is 326,000 gallons, or enough water to cover an acre of land, about the size of a football field, one foot deep. A single acre-foot is enough to sustain two average California households for a year. Of these savings, 2.3m acre-feet will be compensated by the federal government, with $1.2bn going to cities, tribes and water districts. The rest of the savings will be voluntary, uncompensated ones to be worked out between the states. The agreement averts, for now, the prospect of the Biden administration imposing unilateral water cuts upon the seven states – California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming – that rely upon the river, a prospect that has loomed since last summer when the waterway’s two main reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, hit perilously low levels. In the run-up to the presidential campaign announcement he’s expected to make on Wednesday, Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis has overseen an effort by the state government to restrict what students can learn about race and diversity. That has prompted one of the country’s best-known civil rights groups to issue an unusual warning against visiting the state, the Guardian’s Gloria Oladipo reports: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel advisory for the state of Florida, calling the state “actively hostile” to minorities as Florida’s conservative government limits diversity efforts in schools. In a Saturday press release, the civil rights organization better known as the NAACP said the travel warning comes as Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, “attempts to erase Black history and to restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Florida schools”. “Before traveling to Florida, please understand that the state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by African Americans and other communities of color,” the advisory said. While much of Monday’s political focus has been on the expanded field of 2024 Republican presidential candidates, Texas’s US senator Ted Cruz has drawn unflattering headlines from some quarters for announcing an investigation into the maker of Bud Light as his state is gripped by major crises. Cruz, along with fellow Republican US senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, on Wednesday sent a letter to the beer industry’s regulatory body questioning whether Anheuser-Busch violated guidelines “prohibiting marketing to underage individuals” when transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in April posted a video of herself on Instagram holding a custom Bud Light can with her face on it. Rightwing media outlets and consumers reacted to Mulvaney’s video by calling for a boycott of Bud Light, which reported a 23% drop in sales for the final week of April as compared to the same period during the previous year, according to CBS News. Meanwhile, as Business Insider noted, Cruz’s home state has experienced five of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in recent US history but has offered little in the way of solutions to that. He’s also hardly weighed in as Covid asylum limits known as Title 42 recently expired, giving way to new, arguably tougher immigration policies. The rush to the US-Mexico border in Texas and other parts which preceded the expiration of Title 42 has brought extraordinary pressure to immigration officials, and politicos on both sides of the aisle have so far mostly just bused migrants to different cities rather than devise substantial solutions. “Beer marketing, however – thanks to Cruz – has all the attention of the state’s top leaders” on Capitol Hill, as Insider put it. Of Cruz’s latest culture war entry, Vanity Fair added: “No, he doesn’t have anything better to do.” Tim Scott was announcing his presidential campaign on Monday, when a technical glitch left the 57-year-old senator in silence. “Joe Biden and the radical left are attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. And that is why I am announcing today that I am running for president of the United States of America,” Scott told a cheering crowd at Charleston Southern University in his home state of South Carolina. “Our nation, our values, and our people are strong, but our president is weak,” he added. At that point, the sound cut out. Here’s that moment, if you missed it earlier today: Now that Tim Scott has announced his run for the presidency, my colleague Nick Robins-Early has pulled together 10 things you need to know about the newest Republican hopeful. He writes: Scott is a 57-year-old senator from South Carolina Scott grew up in South Carolina, attending a Baptist university and owning an insurance company before becoming involved in politics. He entered politics in the mid-1990s as a Charleston, South Carolina, city council member before running for Congress. Scott was first elected to Congress in 2010 Scott staked his political claim amid a wave of conservative opposition to Barack Obama’s presidency. As a member of the hardline conservative Tea Party movement, he was endorsed at the time by the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and became a rising star of the party. After two years as a congressman, he was chosen in 2012 to replace the Republican senator Jim DeMint and appointed to the Senate. Scott is the sole Black Republican senator Scott is the only Black Republican senator, and was the first Black Republican elected to the US House of Representatives from South Carolina in over a hundred years. He has previously talked about his unique role as a Black Republican and the discrimination he has faced from authorities, but has claimed that liberals use race as a way to divide voters. He faced heated criticism from Black activists in 2021 after declaring “America is not a racist country” in response to a speech from President Joe Biden that condemned racism following a white supremacist mass shooting. Here’s the full explainer: Politicos and voters of South Carolina who support both US senator Tim Scott and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley have been handed a dilemma now that they have both declared their candidacies for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. As the Associated Press pointed out Monday, Scott and Haley have a lengthy history and were even allies earlier in their careers. Both were members of South Carolina’s state House. And in 2012, while she was serving as governor of South Carolina, Haley appointed Scott to a state Senate seat in 2012. Scott, who is the US Senate’s only Black Republican and formally launched his presidential campaign Monday, told the AP that he doesn’t consider the situation a dilemma and expressed his belief that he and Haley would remain friends despite their competing interests. Meanwhile, the AP said Haley declined to comment when asked about Scott. Others in the Republican field who have already declared include Donald Trump – who appointed Haley to her UN role during his presidency – as well as former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and Woke, Inc author Vivek Ramaswamy. Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis is widely expected to formally announce his presidential campaign in the coming days. As for the Democrats, Joe Biden has announced that he will campaign for a second term in the Oval Office after defeating Trump in the 2020 presidential race. Biden’s declared Democratic challengers so far include self-help author Marianne Williamson and anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr. Republican senator Tim Scott threw his hat into the ring with a speech in South Carolina where he promised to pursue a more compassionate form of conservatism, while advocating for hardline border security policies and downplaying the effects of racial inequality on American society. The GOP’s presidential field is crowded and set to become more packed on Wednesday when Ron DeSantis makes his campaign official, but can anyone defeat the final boss of Republican politicians, Donald Trump? We’ll see. Here’s what else has happened today: Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy will meet at 5.30pm to (hopefully) resolve the debt ceiling standoff, which, by all indications, remains ongoing. Trump and fellow South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham both wished Scott well on his presidential bid. Speaking of Trump, federal prosecutors have evidence that he was warned he could not hold onto classified documents, the Guardian has confirmed. And here’s what Donald Trump has to say about Tim Scott throwing his hat into the presidential ring: Good luck to Senator Tim Scott in entering the Republican Presidential Primary Race. It is rapidly loading up with lots of people, and Tim is a big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious, who is totally unelectable. I got Opportunity Zones done with Tim, a big deal that has been highly successful. Good luck Tim! For those unfamiliar with Trump’s latest batch of zingers: Ron DeSanctimonious is the ex-president’s erstwhile ally Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who is expected to announce his presidential campaign on Wednesday. Senator Tim Scott is now the second South Carolinian vying for the Republican presidential nomination, after former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley. The state’s other senator, Republican Lindsey Graham, has already made public his endorsement of Donald Trump. He nonetheless reserved kind words for Scott in a statement released after his campaign’s official kick off: Congratulations to my good friend Senator Tim Scott on his announcement that he is running for President of the United States. Tim makes South Carolina proud, and he is one of the most talented and hard-working public servants I’ve ever known. He will have an optimistic vision for the future of conservatism and America, and I know he will acquit himself well. The anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America welcomed Senator Tim Scott’s formal entry into the 2024 Republican presidential primary today. “We are encouraged by his commitment to sign the strongest achievable protections for life should he be elected president,” said the group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser. “We welcome Scott and all presidential contenders further outlining their pro-life vision and policy platform.” Scott has vowed to sign “the most conservative, pro-life legislation” that could pass Congress if he becomes president, but he has refused to specify his preferred time frame for a potential federal abortion ban. When asked about his preferred cut-off point for banning the procedure, Scott told NBC News last month: “I’m not going to talk about six or five or seven or 10 [weeks].” Dannenfelser said today, “The pro-life movement is seeking a national defender of life who will boldly advocate a minimum national standard to protect unborn children at least by 15 weeks when they can feel pain, and who will work tirelessly to build consensus and gather the votes necessary in Congress.” In his presidential campaign announcement speech, Tim Scott recounted his upbringing from poverty, discounted the impact of racial inequality on Americans’ lives and restated conservative policy goals, from cutting taxes to building a wall along the US border with Mexico. As he wrapped up his address, he vowed to promote on the campaign trail a friendlier form of conservatism. “This can’t be another presidential campaign. We don’t have time for that. We need a president who persuades not just our friends and our base,” he said. “We have to have a compassion for people who don’t agree with us.” He closed with these words: “I am living proof that God and a good family and the United States of America can do all things, if we believe. Will you believe it with me?” In the months to come, we’ll find out if Republican voters share his faith. Tim Scott has said the magic words. “Joe Biden and the radical left are attacking every single rung of the ladder that helped me climb and that’s why I’m announcing today I’m running for president of the United States of America,” the senator said to applause and cheers in his kick-off speech in North Charleston, South Carolina. He began the speech by recounting his upbringing from poverty and downplaying the impacts of racial disparities in the economy, saying “I’m living proof that America is the land of opportunity and not a land of oppression.” When it comes to policy, the senator is outlining familiar conservative priorities. “On my first day as commander in chief, the strongest nation on earth will stop retreating from our southern border,” he said. He embraced the conservative demand to deploy the military against drug traffickers, and vowed to restart construction of the border wall pioneered by Donald Trump. “When I am president, the drug cartels using Chinese labs and Mexican factories to kill Americans will cease to exist. I will freeze their assets, I will build the wall and I will allow the world’s greatest military to fight these terrorists. Because that’s exactly what they are.” Tim Scott may be the lone Black Republican in the Senate, but his message to Republican voters downplays the impact of racial inequality in America. “For those of you who wonder if America is a racist country, take a look at how people come together,” Scott said. “We are not defined by the color of our skin. We are defined by the content of our character.” Tim Scott is on stage now announcing his presidential bid. “America is the greatest nation on God’s green earth,” the senator began. “And our greatness doesn’t come from politicians, doesn’t come from the government. It comes from we, the people.” “And when I think about the greatness of America, I have to start with my favorite American,” Scott said, before inviting his mother up. “Thank you for your hard work and your dedication. Thank you for believing in me when no one else did.” The senate’s number-two Republican John Thune just gave an introductory speech at Tim Scott’s campaign kick-off event in South Carolina, where he called him “the real deal” who would “make a great president of the United States.” Bloomberg reports that Scott has picked up support from another high-profile, and deep-pocketed, ally: Larry Ellison, CEO of tech juggernaut Oracle: Republican senator Tim Scott will in a few minutes officially kick off his presidential campaign with a speech in North Charleston, South Carolina, making him the latest entrant to the increasingly crowded Republican field. A senator since 2013, Scott is the only Black Republican in the chamber, and will be the second South Carolinian in the presidential race, after former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. He will probably not be alone in announcing his bid for the White House this week. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is expected to kick off his presidential campaign with a speech on Wednesday. Punchbowl News tracked down Kevin McCarthy as he made his way through the Capitol, but the speaker gave no indication that a deal with Joe Biden and the Democrats was near: Joe Biden will meet with Republican speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy in the Oval Office at 5.30pm eastern time, the White House has announced. The goal will be to reach a deal to increase the debt ceiling before 1 June, when the US government may run out of money and default on its obligations for the first time in history. McCarthy and the GOP have demanded spending cuts in exchange for this votes to raise the limit, a prospect that Biden has resisted. The president cut short his trip to Asia last week over the impasse, and returned to Washington yesterday from Japan in order to ensure a deal is done before the end of the month. If Donald Trump is so dominant in the polls, why are Tim Scott and other Republicans jumping into the race to challenge him? Partly because election day is more than a year away, and things could change. Partly because running for president is what many politicians aspire to do. And surely because, though they won’t say it, the former president appears to be in a lot of trouble – perhaps enough to eventually derail his campaign. Here’s the latest from the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell on the investigation into his alleged possession of classified documents: Federal prosecutors have evidence Donald Trump was put on notice that he could not retain any classified documents after he was subpoenaed for their return last year, as they examine whether the subsequent failure to fully comply with the subpoena was a deliberate act of obstruction by the former president. The previously unreported warning conveyed to Trump by his lawyer Evan Corcoran could be significant in the criminal investigation surrounding Trump’s handling of classified materials given it shows he knew about his subpoena obligations. Last June, Corcoran found roughly 40 classified documents in the storage room at Mar-a-Lago and told the justice department that no further materials remained at the property. That was later shown to be untrue, after the FBI later returned with a warrant and seized 101 additional classified documents. A major story happening today is the ongoing negotiations over the debt ceiling, which must be raised by about 1 June in order to prevent a potentially devastating default by the US government. Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy are supposed to meet at some point today to make progress on an agreement, though the timing of that rendezvous has not yet been announced. Here’s the latest from Reuters on the talks: US president Joe Biden and House Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy have held a “productive” phone call on the continued impasse over the debt ceiling and promised to meet on Monday after Biden returned to Washington. McCarthy, speaking to reporters after the call, said there were positive discussions on solving the crisis and that staff-level talks were set to resume later on Sunday. Asked if he was more hopeful after talking to the president, McCarthy said: “Our teams are talking today and we’re … meeting tomorrow. That’s better than it was earlier. So, yes.” Democrats, meanwhile, have some thoughts about Tim Scott. Here’s the statement Democratic National Committee chair Jamie Harrison put out this morning, ahead of the 11 am eastern time kick off of his presidential campaign: Tim Scott wants to govern from the ‘far, conservative right’ as a proud member of the Tea Party, and his extreme record proves it. Even before he refused to name a policy difference with Trump, Scott was a fierce advocate of the MAGA agenda – supporting national abortion bans and championing plans to end Medicare and Social Security as we know them. As an ‘architect’ of Trump’s tax law, Scott gifted corporations billions and has been a longtime champion of rolling back regulations on big banks. There’s no question that special interests are celebrating as Tim Scott throws his hat into the 2024 race for the MAGA base. The task for any Republican candidate not named Donald Trump this year is simple: try to convince the GOP rank-and-file to choose you over the ex-president. The problem is that Trump tops just about every poll looking at the GOP primary field these days, and usually with a mammoth gap. But Tim Scott plans to do his best, and a Republican adviser strategist told Politico more about his path to overtaking Trump. “Their demeanors, their messages, their life stories are just so diametrically different,” the adviser said, and Scott will likely highlight that distinction when he speaks in North Charleston, South Carolina to kick off his campaign. Scott has also received a boost from his colleagues in the Senate. Politico has confirmed that the second-ranking GOP lawmaker in the chamber, John Thune, will endorse his candidacy. While today is his official campaign launch, Scott has been touring the country for a few weeks now, particularly early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. The Guardian’s Joan E Greve spent time among the crowds who greeted him in the Granite State for this look at what his pitch is to Republican voters: About 45 minutes into his New Hampshire town hall, Tim Scott said he needed to reveal a secret to the Republican voters who had gathered to hear from the presidential hopeful. “Listen, this might surprise some of y’all,” Scott told attendees with subtle laughter in his voice. He paused briefly: “I’m Black.” The line was met with loud laughter from the mostly white crowd, and it underscored the unique role that Scott faces in the Republican presidential primary ahead of the 2024 election. The 57-year-old senator of South Carolina and erstwhile Donald Trump ally, who filed paperwork on Friday to declare his presidential candidacy ahead of a formal launch event on Monday, hopes to become the first Black politician to win his party’s nomination and go on to defeat Joe Biden in the general election next November. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Today at 11 am eastern time, South Carolina’s senator Tim Scott will officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. He joins an increasingly crowded field of challengers to Joe Biden that already includes former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and Arkansas’s ex-governor Asa Hutchinson, and will soon see the arrival for Florida governor Ron DeSantis. But when it comes to the Republican field, the question today remains the same as it has for months, if not years: can anyone unseat Donald Trump from his post as the most popular man in the GOP? Polls consistently show the former president at the front of the pack, with DeSantis a distant second and Scott in the single digits. The senator is the GOP’s only Black lawmaker in the chamber, and with his slogan “Faith in America” appears ready to adopt a more optimistic tone compared to Trump’s fear-and-grievance driven campaign. We’ll see if it’s enough to break through the field. Here’s what else is happening today: Joe Biden will at some point today sit down with Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy to once again try to find agreement on raising the debt ceiling, as the 1 June default deadline grows alarmingly near. Speaking of senators, Delaware Democrat Tom Carper will this morning announce if he will run for another term, but even if he steps aside, the seat is considered safe territory for Biden’s party. Kamala Harris is continuing her trip to California, where she’ll meet with the leaders of tech firms to talk about semiconductors and the Biden administration’s efforts to spur more domestic manufacturing of the vital component."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/ron-desantis-police-relocation-violent-records","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T19:39:31Z","webTitle":"DeSantis’s $13.5m police program lures officers with violent records to Florida","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/ron-desantis-police-relocation-violent-records","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/ron-desantis-police-relocation-violent-records","fields":{"headline":"DeSantis’s $13.5m police program lures officers with violent records to Florida","bodyText":"Numerous police officers lured to new jobs in Florida with cash from Governor Ron DeSantis’s flagship law enforcement relocation program have histories of excessive violence or have been arrested for crimes including kidnapping and murder since signing up, a study of state documents has found. DeSantis, who is expected to launch his campaign for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination this week, has spent more than $13.5m to date on the recruitment bonus program, which he touted in 2021 as an incentive to officers in other states frustrated by Covid-19 vaccination mandates. “This will go a long way to ensuring we can have the best and the brightest filling our law enforcement ranks,” Florida’s Republican attorney general, Ashley Moody, said in April last year as DeSantis announced one-time $5,000 bonuses for new recruits. However, among the almost 600 officers who moved to Florida and received the bonus – or were recruited in state – are a sizable number who either arrived with a range of complaints against them, or have since accrued criminal charges, the online media outlet Daily Dot has discovered. They include a former trainee deputy with the Escambia county sheriff’s office charged with murdering her husband; an officer with the Miramar police department fired for domestic battery and kidnapping; and a former member of the New York police department (NYPD) who was hired by the Palm Beach police department having once been accused of an improper sexual proposition. That officer, named by the Daily Dot as Daniel Meblin, was also part of a $160,000 settlement by the NYPD for violence at a 2020 protest against the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in which officers were accused of beating Black males without provocation. A Palm Beach police spokesperson told the Daily Dot that Meblin – who had complaints against him including abuse of authority and sexually propositioning a teenager – had disclosed his background during the hiring process, according to the NYPD watchdog 50-a.org. He has been an “exemplary” officer since he was hired in October 2022, the same month he left the NYPD, the spokesperson said, while denying a request to allow Meblin to be interviewed. The Daily Dot compiled its report from state records it obtained from the Florida department of economic opportunity through a Freedom of Information Act request. The undated document lists payments of more than $8.8m split between 1,310 newly hired officers, with most receiving $6,693.44 from the signing-on and additional bonuses. In a press release earlier this month, DeSantis announced the program had since grown to more than 2,000 officers, with a parallel rise in cost to more than $13.5m. “To date, 595 law enforcement recruits from 49 states and US territories have relocated to Florida, including more than 215 recruits from California, Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania,” the statement said. For its report, the Daily Dot matched information from the 50-a and NYPD databases, as well as published media reports, to officers’ names listed by the state. It says it uncovered “an exodus” of officers to Florida law enforcement agencies from the NYPD in the wake of a backlash against the department for its brutal handling of racial justice protests in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Among them were at least two dozen officers whose names matched those on the NYPD’s civilian complaint review board database, including some who, according to those complaints, “unlawfully pepper sprayed, assaulted, and pointed their firearms at suspects, as well as used chokeholds and offensive language regarding race and ethnicity”. A civil rights lawsuit filed in 2018 against former NYPD sergeant Haitham Hussameldin alleged the officer used physical violence against a teenager on her way to school. Hussameldin, now employed by Florida’s Manapalan police department, accrued six formal complaints, including “multiple allegations of abuse of authority and overuse of physical force” in New York, the Daily Dot said. All the complaints were withdrawn or unsubstantiated. Another former New York officer now employed in Florida was involved in two deaths, one of which led to a $100,000 civil settlement, the Daily Dot reported. And in October 2022, the Apopka police department hired as an officer Justin Burgos, 19, the son of a retired NYPD deputy inspector, who a year earlier was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and obstruction of governmental administration for driving his car into protesters in Manhattan calling for the firing of an officer accused of beating a Black suspect. None of the police agencies contacted for comment responded, other than the Palm Beach department, the Daily Dot reported. DeSantis’s office did not return a request for comment from the Guardian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/22/club-zero-review-not-much-to-chew-on-in-this-baffling-non-satire","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T19:20:42Z","webTitle":"Club Zero review – not much to chew on in this baffling non-satire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/club-zero-review-not-much-to-chew-on-in-this-baffling-non-satire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/22/club-zero-review-not-much-to-chew-on-in-this-baffling-non-satire","fields":{"headline":"Club Zero review – not much to chew on in this baffling non-satire","bodyText":"Jessica Hausner is the Austrian director whose elegant, refrigerated style has made her a Cannes favourite and her 2009 film Lourdes, about the ordinary world of miracles, is a 21st-century classic. But her recent move to English-language movies has resulted in some nebulous work in the shape of her 2019 picture Little Joe, and so it has proved again with this exasperating and baffling movie. Club Zero is a strenuous, pointless non-satire which fails to say anything of value about its ostensible subjects: body image, eating disorders and western overconsumption. The “trigger warning” at the beginning of the film about these issues is fatuous, whether intended ironically or not. The deadpan mannerisms are glib, the line readings are torpid in the wrong way and the laborious drama leads us round and round and round like an Escher staircase. But it is certainly well shot by Martin Gschlacht and punctiliously designed by Beck Rainford. The scene is an exclusive private school for teens from wealthy families, many of whom are expats; it appears to be in the UK, judging by the home-life scenes, but could as well be in Munich or Lille. At all events, teaching is in English. The pupils themselves, in their uniform of yellow T-shirt and shorts, mostly speak in an upper-middle-class vocal-fry drone; the principal Ms Dorset (Sidse Babett Knudsen) prides herself on the school’s dynamic, forward-thinking attitudes. Dorset has recently hired a charismatic new teacher called Ms Novak (Mia Wasikowska), who markets her own brand of healthy tea and runs a course in Conscious Eating; this is a study in mindfulness, meditation and focused thought directed at cutting down the wasteful and damaging way we gorge on processed foods. Pupils can get course credits for what appears to be a pretty undemanding discipline and one boy might even qualify for a free scholarship in the following year. Ms Novak’s evangelical passion for the subject casts a spell over the five pupils in her class. And then she tells them they are to be the privileged secret few who will form the nucleus of her revolutionary Club Zero, young people who will survive on no food at all; a quietly fanatical Jonestown cult existing in plain sight. There have been movies recently that have dealt audaciously and satirically with the sexual politics of eating disorders, such as Ruth Paxton’s A Banquet and Sebastián Lelio’s The Wonder, but they had a clarity and force that Club Zero doesn’t. For all its icy formal control, there is a lack of rigour in its thinking and narrative threads about sexual impropriety lead nowhere. Moreover there are cliches: there needs to be a screenwriting ban on “Mandarin classes” to indicate overworked schoolkids with overambitious parents. The film seems to be mocking obviously absurd ideas; essentially it is pointing out imaginary fish in a made-up barrel and saying that these fictional fish deserve to be shot, and also that the people aiming guns at them are uptight and stupid as well. No one actually says the words “bulimia” and “anorexia” out loud, and it is not clear if avoiding these obvious terms is an artistic choice, a comment on denial, or just a way of skirting the obvious plot problem: the fact that today’s clued-up young people would be aware of the problems long before Ms Novak tried inducting them into her bizarre movement. And when Ms Novak condemns overconsumption and greed … well, it’s not immediately clear that these ideas are wrong or that they deserve to be satirically escalated into obviously grotesque self-harm. It’s another miss from this otherwise very talented film-maker. • Club Zero screened at the Cannes film festival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/how-long-can-sunak-swerve-braverman-speeding-ministerial-code","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T19:07:46Z","webTitle":"How long can Sunak swerve the obvious on Braverman’s speeding? | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/how-long-can-sunak-swerve-braverman-speeding-ministerial-code","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/how-long-can-sunak-swerve-braverman-speeding-ministerial-code","fields":{"headline":"How long can Sunak swerve the obvious on Braverman’s speeding?","bodyText":"We’re a long way past the point where we need to ask what exactly Suella Braverman has on Rishi Sunak. Has she somehow got hold of a recording of a telephone call in which Dominic Raab thanks the prime minister for joining him on one of his regular nocturnal killing sprees? Has she got hold of a video of Rish! telling Goldman Sachs clients how best to avoid paying tax? Or is there CCTV footage of Sunak snorting coke and leading the singing at the Abba party during lockdown? Whatever it is, it must be weapons-grade kompromat. It’s the only thing that makes sense. Why else is she still in her job? Indeed, why was she even made home secretary in the first place? When Rish! got the top job he made a point of saying he was going to be different from what had come before. He was going to govern with “integrity, professionalism and accountability”. So what’s the first thing he did? Appoint Suella to one of the four big offices of state just six days after she had been fired for breaking the ministerial code by leaking government policy via her private email. Since then, Braverman has done her best to live down to her reputation for untrustworthiness and incompetence. She is – by a long way – one of the stupidest home secretaries we’ve had for many years. Which is saying something. I guess Sunak has learned to live with breaking international law over the small boats policy and the casual racism of suggesting all grooming gangs were Asian. After all, he is “far-right curious”. He gets a vicarious, sexual thrill out of Suella’s bigotry and hatred. Makes him feel just the slightest bit bigger. But the thing is, she’s all mouth. She’s achieved nothing. Immigration has gone up to record levels on her watch. Now we’ve come to Suella’s latest indiscretion. It was only a matter of time. Someone that dim and that arrogant was bound to fuck up again sooner rather than later. Having been caught for speeding – it’s getting to be a Home Office habit: Robert Jenrick is serving a six-month ban – Braverman tried to get her civil servants to see if she could have her own private speed awareness course that no one would ever know about. And her special adviser then lied to the press about it four times. Her civil servants were more concerned about the ministerial code than she was. They told her where to get off and reported her to their bosses. And yet Sunak has done nothing. Even though several senior civil servants, including Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, have observed Suella’s actions are a clear breach of the ministerial code – a mixing of the personal and public – Rish! has dithered and delayed. Saying he wanted to avail himself of more information. Like what, for instance? Does he think that if she was only 5mph above the speed limit, then the offence doesn’t really count? Or that all civil servants have the lawyer Nick “Mr Loophole” Freeman on speed dial? He can’t even bring himself to ask his own ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, to conduct his own inquiry. Just in case he concludes what is already blindingly obvious to everyone else. It may not be the most egregious breach of the ministerial code. Certainly not by Braverman’s usual gung-ho standards. But she still broke the code. Integrity, professionalism and accountability. Just words. The same old stuff from a tired administration that doesn’t even recognise how it has managed to corrupt itself. Normally, Suella tries to ride out her uselessness and wrongdoing by going to ground. Hiding from the public. Not a good look. On Monday, this wasn’t an option and she had an afternoon appointment in the Commons with Home Office questions. Something that she couldn’t avoid. So she chose to break the ice with a quick, 90-second pooled TV clip. She was delivering on the people’s priorities, she insisted. She really wasn’t. Just wait till she sees the immigration figures on Thursday. And she was convinced that “nothing untoward” had happened. Really? Then why did she keep it so quiet? Even the weaselly “Honest Bob” Jenrick had fessed up. Do the crime, take the time. And if there was nothing to hide, then welcome an inquiry. Bring it on. There was more of the same in the Commons later in the afternoon. Starting with Tory Paul Howell complimenting her on “driving” the antisocial behaviour initiative. He blushed as he realised his choice of words could have been better. Then Labour got stuck in. Emma Lewell-Buck, Sarah Jones and Yvette Cooper all asked the same question. Speeding was a serious offence. A major cause of death. This was not trivial. So what instructions had Braverman given to her civil servants to try to get her own customised sanctions? By now, Suella was beginning to sound like a broken record. Like a diehard recidivist saying “no comment” in a police interview when everyone knows she’s guilty. “I regret speeding,” she mumbled, refusing to look anyone in the eye. “But I took the points, so I didn’t try to avoid a sanction.” Which wasn’t strictly true. A speeding awareness course is not a negotiation. Part of the penalty is taking it with other people so you can learn from their mistakes. It’s not the bespoke service Braverman was trying to organise for herself. So much for being a home secretary on the people’s side. Suella also noticeably, time and again, refused to answer the central point: what she had and hadn’t said to civil servants. She couldn’t have appeared more shifty if she had tried. A lack of engagement with reality that was almost pathological. She ended each outburst with a word salad about how it was all just another smear to detract from how she was delivering for the people. Amazing how often these smears crop up when she’s the one who has broken the rules. Just before the end of the session, Sunak appeared in readiness to make his statement on the G7 in Japan. He gave Braverman a tentative tap on the shoulder, but thereafter tried to create distance between them. An awkward encounter. Rish! looked confused. As if he knew he ought to be doing something but was just too scared. He can’t even stop her making rival leadership speeches at fringe Conservative conferences. All he can manage is less than full support. Sooner or later – maybe even tomorrow – he is going to have to grow some. Otherwise he will be just blown away. Just more jetsam from the sinking Tory boat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-speeding-row-ministerial-code-ethics-inquiry-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T19:07:18Z","webTitle":"Sunak says he wants more information before decision on Braverman’s alleged breach of ministerial code – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-speeding-row-ministerial-code-ethics-inquiry-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-speeding-row-ministerial-code-ethics-inquiry-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Sunak says he wants more information before decision on Braverman’s alleged breach of ministerial code – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all for today, as Suella Braverman has said she is “confident” that nothing untoward happened in relation to a speeding ticket but did not address the allegation she asked officials to organise a private speed awareness course. The home secretary told reporters she was “confident that nothing untoward has happened” in relation to the story that she asked one of her staff to try to organise the lesson. Rishi Sunak has asked for more information on the situation before asking his independent adviser on ethics for his view. He told the Commons: “I have met with both the independent adviser [Sir Laurie Magnus] and the home secretary. I’ve asked for further information and I’ll update on the appropriate course of action in due course.” The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the Commons that her opposite number had a track record of behaving as if she was “above the rules”. In the same session, Braverman published the government’s response to the report from the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA). In a statement to MPs, she said that the government was accepting 19 out of 20 of the final recommendations, and that the report should lead to “fundamental change”. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the party would get heart attacks and strokes down by a quarter within a decade during a speech on his plans for the NHS. On suicide, he says Labour would reverse the number of deaths by suicide. Starmer added that the NHS would get more funding but that the health service was not “sustainable” in its current state. Rishi Sunak gave a statement on the G7 summit, and denied that Britain was in retreat on the world stage, citing the UK’s role in supporting Ukraine. Junior doctors in England will stage a fresh strike for three days next month after negotiations with ministers failed to resolve their pay dispute. That’s all for today. Thank you for following along. More from the rally outside parliament in opposition to the anti-strikes bill being discussed in the Commons on Monday evening. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, has called for a “mass campaign of workplace disobedience” if the bill goes ahead. He told the rally: “We will defy this law. If this law comes into fruition … the TUC and all of the trade unions affiliated and every worker in this country has got to unleash a mass campaign of workplace disobedience.” Lynch urged Labour MPs to vote against the legislation. “It’s easy,” he said. “You just have to walk across the room and stand in a hall and vote against it.” He went on to say that a bill of rights for workers was needed. “We need a new deal that enshrines in law ... the right to strike as a human and civil right,” he said, PA Media reported. Lynch added: “If the Labour party and others want our vote … they must repeal and unshackle the unions and repeal four decades of anti-union laws and let us rebalance the workplace on behalf of our members.” Junior doctors in England will stage a fresh strike for three days next month after negotiations with ministers failed to resolve their pay dispute. The 72-hour stoppage will run from 7am on Wednesday 14 June to 7am on Saturday 17 June, the British Medical Association announced on Monday evening. It will be the third strike junior doctors have held as part of a campaign to force ministers to give them a 35% pay rise to make up for what they estimate to be a 26.2% fall in the real-terms value of their salaries since 2008. Read more: The Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has likened the government’s anti-strikes bill to a “Conservatives’ sacking nurses bill”. She told the Commons: “We oppose this bill in its entirety and we stand ready to repeal it when in government. “That said we do thank members of all parties in the Lords who made the thoughtful and sensible amendments that we consider tonight. While these don’t solve all of the very long list of issues with this legislation, they significantly take the sting from its worst elements. “For that reason, on this side of the house, we will reject all attempts by the government to remove these amendments.” Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said the government believed amendments made in the Lords to the strikes (minimum services levels) bill could delay the reforms and make them “inoperable”, adding that the government did not support them. One of the key changes made to the bill by peers was a measure that would ensure staff who fail to comply with a work notice on strike days do not face the sack or disciplinary action, with Hollinrake telling the Commons: “The government considers these amendments were intended to make the bill inoperable.” He added: “Amendment four ensures there can be no consequences for a worker who does not comply with a work notice. The government disagrees with this as without such consequences an employer is powerless to manage instances of non-compliance, which will continue the disproportionate impact strikes can have on the public – severely undermining the effectiveness of this legislation. “Given this amendment would make the bill ineffective, as I suspect the opposition intended, the government cannot support it.” Peers also demanded consultation before the use of key ministerial powers to specify minimum services levels, including the involvement of parliament, which Hollinrake labelled “duplicative and would ultimately end up delaying implementation of the policy”. The government also wants to overturn moves by peers to limit the legislation to England only, after peers expressed concerns the bill would infringe on services devolved to Wales and Scotland. A rally is taking place outside parliament, as the Commons gets prepared to debate the Lords’ amendments to the strikes bill. Labour MP Jo Stevens has promised that Labour “will” repeal the strikes (minimum service levels) bill if it gets passed. Speaking to a crowd of more than 100 people at a rally in Parliament Square, central London, the shadow Welsh secretary said: “I promise you if Labour gets into power at the next election, and I hope we will, we will repeal this legislation.” She later reiterated: “If it passes on the back of Tory votes, no ifs, no buts, Labour will repeal it.” She called the bill “indefensible”, PA Media reports. “This is all about Rishi Sunak distracting from the Tory conveyor belt of crisis with a vindictive attack on working people,” she added. Streeting says that Braverman does “have form” for breaking the rules – a reference to her sacking last year because she sent an official document from her personal email to a fellow MP. He added: “We have got to hold ministers to the rules, otherwise what’s the point in having them? I think the most obvious and easy thing to do is to ask [Rishi Sunak’s] independent adviser on ethics and the ministerial code [Sir Laurie Magnus] to do a review and present the report. “But Rishi Sunak is so weak and held hostage by Suella Braverman and the right of the Conservative party, he can’t even ask for advice. That’s how weak he is. “I also think it’s a problem when special advisers lie on behalf of their bosses, it tells us something about the boss. I don’t think it’s acceptable to tell bare-faced lies to journalists, as has seemed to have happened in this case.” Wes Streeting is speaking to Andrew Marr on his drivetime LBC show. Marr opened the show by reflecting on Labour’s promises on the outcomes from strokes and heart attacks, given his own major stroke in 2013, saying he would not be broadcasting without NHS care. Streeting said the plans for the NHS have been costed. He said that most people expect Labour to invest in the health service which is why Labour is trailing its ideas for reform. “We’ve deliberately gone out there making the strong case for reform first and foremost. What the want to know is are we serious about modernising and changing,” he said. In terms of spending Streeting said that Labour has policies, such as removing tuition fees, that it would like to put in place but will not because of the cost. The shadow health secretary added that Labour is hoping to spend money in the NHS more efficiently, and to stop people turning up to accident and emergency departments unnecessarily, which costs the NHS more. Streeting refuses to say whether he would resign if Labour fails to deliver its promises on the NHS if the party is elected, but said he would not expect to be in the job for much longer. On a question about immigration, he said there are some benefits from immigration, including students coming from abroad to study in the UK. However he said he thought net migration should come down if Labour wins the next general election. He said: “The NHS will always be an international employer. I think that is a strength. But is there an over-reliance on international labour? Absolutely … so [we would] train more people here.” A high-profile Tory member of the Welsh Senedd has announced her bid to become mayor of London. Natasha Asghar, the shadow minister for transport and technology, told the Guardian on Monday she had submitted her application. She has been leading the fight against plans in Wales for ultra-low emission zones (ULEZ) and more 20mph schemes. Asghar said: “I have spent the best part of two years fighting against Labour’s backwards policies in Wales and now I am ready to take the fight to London.” She said if she became mayor she would scrap expansion of London’s ULEZ schemes, work to restore trust in the Met police and tackle the housing crisis. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, told Times Radio earlier that it would be wrong for a minister like Suella Braverman to “pull strings” to try to cover up wrongdoing. But he sounded more angry about her speech to the National Conservatism conference last week, which was widely seen as the opening salvo in a leadership bid for after the next election. He said: We’re just beginning to get back to some form of normality. It has been a turbulent year in British politics ... yet we see the home secretary stirring the right of the party, almost writing off our prospects to win the next election. Asked if he was accusing Braverman of making a pitch to be leader of the opposition after the anticipated Tory defeat at the general election, Ellwood replied: That’s I’m afraid how it’s interpreted. It distracts us from what we’re starting to do. It’s somewhat baffling to see the right of our party, encouraged by Suella Braverman, write off chances of winning the next election, having the very debate as if we’ve lost now as to where the party should then go. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Harry Taylor is taking over now. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has published the government’s response to the report from the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA). In a statement to MPs, she said that the government was accepting 19 out of 20 of the final recommendations, and that the report should lead to “fundamental change”. She said: It is a call for fundamental change, cultural change, societal change, professional and institutional change. I am pleased today that this government has risen to the inquiry’s challenge. We are accepting the need to act on 19 out of the inquiry’s 20 final recommendations … We must address the systemic under reporting of child sexual abuse. As I announced in April the government accepts the inquiry’s recommendation to introduce a new mandatory reporting duty across England and today I am launching the call for evidence which will inform how this new duty can be best designed to prevent the continued abuse of children and ensure they get help as soon as possible. The inquiry recommended a redress scheme for victims and survivors of historic child sexual abuse which the government also accepts. Of course nobody can ever fully compensate victims and survivors for the abuse they suffered. But what we can do is properly acknowledge their suffering, deliver justice and an appropriate form of redress. This is a landmark commitment, it will be complex and it will be challenging, but it really matters. In a column for the i Paul Waugh says, if Rishi Sunak does not trust Suella Braverman, it may be hard to see why the public should. He cites examples of colleagues doubting her competence, and quotes one unnamed former minister saying she was “completely useless” when they worked together. He also points out that, on speeding, Braverman has form. When she first became an MP, she asked officials if MPs could claim the cost of a speeding ticket on expenses, the Tory MP William Wragg revealed earlier this year. Earlier in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, asked Rishi Sunak if he backed international calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Any peace process had to start with a ceasefire, he said. “Otherwise this war will go on and get worse and worse,” he said. Sunak said he could not disagree more. He said a ceasefire was “not a just and lasting peace for Ukraine”. Russia had conducted an illegal invasion and committed “heinous war crimes”, he said. He went on: The right and only response to that is for Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine and that all plans masquerading as peace plans, that are in fact attempts just to freeze the conflict where it is, are absolutely wrong and should be called out. Back in the Commons, Andrew Western (Lab) asked Rishi Sunak if he had met his ethics adviser to discuss the Suella Braverman case, if there would be an inquiry, and if Braverman would be sacked if found to have broken the ministerial code. In response, Sunak said this was not a topic that came up at the G7 (the subject of his statement). But he said, in the interests of being generous, he would respond. He went on: I’ve always been clear that where issues like this are raised, they should be dealt with properly and they should be dealt with professionally. Since I returned from the G7 I have been receiving information on the issues raised. I have met with both the independent adviser [Sir Laurie Magnus] and the home secretary. I’ve asked for further information and I’ll update on the appropriate course of action in due course. This does suggest that Sunak is not taking Braverman’s assurance that “nothing untoward has happened” (see 12.38pm) at face value. At the afternoon lobby briefing, No 10 refused to endorse Suella Braverman’s claim that she did “nothing untoward” related to her response to a speeding offence, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti points out. And there is still no decision on whether Sir Laurie Magnus, the ethics adviser, will be asked to investigate whether Braverman broke the ministerial code. Barbara Keeley (Lab) says Ukrainian orchestras are being prevented from travelling to the UK because getting visas is now so difficult. Will the PM offer special help with this? Sunak says he will look into this matter. But the priority is supporting Ukraine militarily, he says. Sir Edward Leigh (Con) says legal immigration is changing the country forever. What is the PM going to do about it? Sunak says that was not a topic at the G7. But he says he is committed to bringing it down. On illegal immigration, he says cooperation with allies is bringing benefits. The UK is in talks about further cooperation with Frontex, the EU’s border agency. Labour’s Ruth Jones, who represents Newport West, says the semiconductor strategy is very important to her constituency. (A semiconductor factory is based there.) She says Sunak should have announced this is in a statement to MPs, not while he was in Japan. Sunak says the strategy has been warmly welcomed. It includes an investment of £1bn in the industry, he says. Paul Waugh from the i says, as Rishi Sunak was taking his seat earlier, he made a point of showing support for Suella Braverman. Sunak is responding to Starmer. He says the UK has already imposed sanctions on the Wagner group in its entirety. He says the government set out a new approach to China in its updated integrated review. Starmer may have missed it, he suggests. Other countries are following the same approach, he says. On climate change, he claims the UK has the best record on reducing emissions. And he says that at the G7 Japanese firms announced £18bn of investment in the UK. If they have confidence in the UK, why doesn’t Starmer? Keir Starmer is repsonding to Sunak. He says the UK should stand with Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. And he says Labour welcomes the strong show of support for President Zelenskiy at the G7. But he urges the PM to proscribe the Wagner group as terrorists. On China, he says it is becoming increasingly aggressive. For a decade the Tories have ignored this, he says. China has now got a stake in UK infrastructure. He calls for an audit of UK-China relations. And he urges the UK to work with allies on this issue. The US and the EU have plans to nurture their semiconductor industries. Yet the government’s plan has been described by an industry leader as ‘flaccid”. He says he is worried about this. He says the government seems content with “managed decline”. He says the EU is ensuring that its car manufacturers get access to the green incentives offered by the US government for electric cars. Will Sunak ensure British manufacturers get the same advantages? Rishi Sunak starts his statement on the G7 summit by saying he wants to address a mistaken view – that Britain is in retreat on the world stage, or that its influence is in decline. He says he rejects that view totally. He says the influence of the UK is clear in policy on Ukraine. The UK has been at the forefront of support for Ukraine. It was the first in Europe to train Ukrainian troops, and the first to provide lethal weapons. And it is providing Ukraine with more military aid than any country apart from US, he says. Alison Thewliss, the SNP spokesperson on home affairs, said that being caught speeding can affect decisions about whether someone gets leave to remain in the UK. So shouldn’t being caught speeding affect Suella Braverman’s right to remain in her job? Back in the Commons Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says Suella Braverman tried to get special treatment when she was caught speeding. She says Braverman has not said exactly what she asked her civil servants to do. Will she say? And she asks if Braverman authorised her special adviser to tell journalists that there was no speeding offence, when there was. Braverman avoids the questions, and repeats the stock answer she used earlier. Cooper says Braverman is not answering the questions, even though it is her job to follow the ministerial code. She says Braverman has broken the rules before. She goes on: Time and again, she tries to think that she’s above the normal rules, breaching security even though she’s responsible for it, trying to avoid penalties even though she sets them, reappointed even after breaking the ministerial code, and criticising Home Office policies even though she’s in charge of them and is failing on knife crime, on Channel crossings, on immigration and more. The prime minister is clearly too weak to sort this out. Well, if the home secretary cannot get a grip of her own rule-breaking behaviour, how can she get a grip on anything else? Braverman says Labour should get a grip because it has failed to represent the public’s priorities. Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland and first minister designate, has said that it would be unacceptable for the DUP to delay the resumption of power sharing at Stormont until the autumn. Speaking after her party got the largest number of councillors in the local elections in Northern Ireland, O’Neill said: There’s a lot of talk about the autumn timeframe. That’s not acceptable. That’s drift. We should not allow this to drift into the autumn. So, now’s the time for action and the two governments should step up … We’re in no doubt this election result shouts very loudly ‘get back to work, get the assembly up and running, get the executive up and running, lead from the front and deliver for all the people’. O’Neill also said that she wanted Rishi Sunak and Leo Varadkar, his Irish counterpart, to co-chair a summit to encourage the resumption of power sharing. In his speech and Q&amp;A this morning Keir Starmer said that Labour wanted to use technology to cut costs and improve services in the NHS. In an article for the Guardian he has expanded on this theme, citing as an example how Labour would revive the NHS app used during Covid, and use it more widely. He says: So what could a tech revolution in the NHS look like? More than 30 million people signed up to the NHS app during the pandemic. That is a big number and represents the majority of adults in this country. Covid made it necessary. Yet, post-Covid, this resource – a resource that could be harnessed for the good of the public – has been left dormant. It’s another tale of our time – another opportunity missed, indicating the absence of strong leadership. A Labour government would get hold of that NHS app and use it to drive forward a more patient-focused, responsive service. Get this right and it means moving to “a single front door to all NHS services” – fully digital patient records. In one place a patient will be able to book appointments, use appropriate self-referral routes, get reminders for checkups and screenings, receive the latest guidance on treatment and have the ability to take part in clinical trials, something particularly important if you are one of the more than 3 million people in the UK who will be affected by a rare disease in their lifetime … A fully digital NHS will mean primary care, hospital care and social care are joined up properly for the first time, speaking to each other in ways that can speed up and streamline care for patients. The full article is here. Sarah Jones, the shadow Home Office minister, also asked Suella Braverman about her speeding. She asked Braverman if people caught speeding should be allowed to take speed awareness courses in private. And she asked what Braverman asked her officials to do. Braverman delivered, almost word for word, the same answer she gave to Emma Lewell-Buck. (See 2.43pm.) But she then claimed Labour was raising this issue to distract from its own record. She went on: Let’s be honest about what this is all about. The shadow minister would rather distract, really, from the abject failure by the Labour party to offer any serious proposal on crime or policing. They want to talk about this because it distracts from the fact that they voted against tougher sentences for paedophiles and murderers, they want us to ignore the fact that Labour MPs would rather the campaign to stop the deportation of foreign criminals than back our Rwanda scheme, they would rather the country does not notice their total abandonment of the British people. UPDATE: Eventually Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, told Braverman she was going on too long, prompting this headline from the Mirror. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is now taking the regular Home Office questions in the Commons. The first question is about anti-social behaviour. Paul Howell (Con) asked a routine question, but the first supplementary was from Labour’s Emma Lewell-Buck and she asked Braverman about her speeding. In response, Braverman gave a similar answer to the one she gave in a TV interview earlier. (See 12.49pm.) She said that last summer she was caught speeding. She said she regrets that. She paid the fine and took the penalty. She went on: “At no point did I attempt to evade sanction.” She then said she was focused on the people’s priorities. No one has actually suggested that Braverman did try to avoid having to face a sanction. The allegation is that she wanted to do a speed awareness course in private, not in a group (which might have lessened the embarrassment), and that she asked her civil servants if they could help arrange this (which arguably would be a breach of the ministerial code). Only 9% of Britons think Brexit has been more of a success than a failure, according to new polling from YouGov. Some 62% of people think it has been more of a failure. The figure suggest that Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and then the Brexit party, was speaking for a large chunk of the population when he said last week that “Brexit has failed”. Farage said that Brexit could have succeeded, but that it did not because the politicians in charge were “useless”. The YouGov polling suggests around 75% of leave voters think the same way; while 14% of leave voters say Brexit was always going to be a failure, three-quarters of them say it could have worked but failed because of how it was implemented. The polling also shows that, by a margin of almost two to one, Britons think voting to leave the EU in 2016 was wrong. A DUP MP has claimed that the results of the local elections in Northern Ireland, which saw Sinn Féin win the largest number of council seats for the first time, vindicate his party’s stance on the Northern Ireland protocol. The DUP has been boycotting power sharing at Stormont for more than a year because it is opposed to the protocol. It says the changes announced under the Windsor framework, the revised version of the protocol announced earlier this year, do not go far enough. Even though the DUP came behind Sinn Féin in the election, Gavin Robinson said his party ended up with the same number of councillors as it had four years ago. He told the BBC: I think it is incredibly positive because not only do we have the same number of councillors returned, we have an increased vote in many areas across Northern Ireland. More importantly, there is a recognition of the stance we have taken to resolve the impenetrable issues that have been affecting Northern Ireland’s politics over the last number of years associated with the Northern Ireland protocol and the Windsor framework. Despite the barrage that we have faced over the last number of months, I think there is tacit recognition amongst the unionist electorate that there is a job that needs doing, it needs to be resolved and when we can get firm foundations for the restoration of devolution, we should do so. Until that time comes, we have to keep on the path we are on. Political groups on the left have claimed that Keir Starmer was not radical enough in his speech on the NHS this morning. In a response from the Green party, its co-leader, Carla Denyer, said: Starmer claims that it’s not all about the money, but years of underfunding is the key challenge facing the NHS. More reorganisation and target setting will simply be rearranging the beds in the corridor. Staff shortages and recruitment problems can only be seriously addressed by offering NHS staff a pay rise in line with inflation. The Green party will unashamedly go after the super-rich who have seen their wealth surge in recent years. By increasing their taxes, we can ensure NHS staff are properly paid and that the years of underfunding of our NHS is addressed. And this is from Kate Dove, co-chair of the leftwing Labour group Momentum. Keir Starmer is right to diagnose the importance of prevention in tackling the Tory NHS crisis. But his prescriptions miss the elephant in the room, and risk compounding the problem. Our NHS is on its knees as a result of more than a decade of Tory austerity and under-investment, resulting in record, deadly waiting times and staff leaving in droves. We will not fix this crisis without a major, real-terms investment boost, both to tackle the ongoing recruitment crisis, and to adapt to an ageing society. As Keir Starmer once suggested, we should also end NHS outsourcing, while putting an end to the NHS privatisation which has driven this crisis, instead of Wes Streeting’s calls for more private sector use of the NHS. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former business secretary and an ideological ally of Suella Braverman, has told the World at One that he thought there was no need for Rishi Sunak to order an inquiry into claims that she broke the ministerial code. This was “not a big story”, he said. He said he hoped the PM would “close down the subject”. He said that ministers sometimes asked their civil servants to do things they were not able to do. As long as the minister accepts that, they have not done anything wrong, he said. He also said that the lawyer Nick Freeman, who specialising in dealing with speeding offences, has said that he has arranged private speed awareness courses for high-profile clients. Providers liked that because it meant the other attendees were not distracted by having a famous person there, Rees-Mogg said. Rees-Mogg also said he did not believe in the “conspiracy theories” about this only being in the news now because Braverman was being targeted for her political views. The Conservative party claims Labour cannot be trusted to fulfil its promise to improve performance in the NHS in England because of the party’s record in government in Wales. In response to Keir Starmer’s speech this morning, CCHQ released a response from Will Quince, a health minister. He said: It’s easy to shout from the sidelines, but the truth is Labour in Wales are currently missing all the targets Sir Keir Starmer has just set out for England. Labour have been running the health service in Wales for 25 years and haven’t met these targets. Sir Keir has a record of changing his mind – we can’t trust these will be Labour’s targets next week let alone in five years’ time. This Conservative government has already reduced 18-month waits by 91% from their peak, and two-year waits are virtually eliminated. We are delivering on our priorities to cut waiting lists and to improve the lives of everyone across the country. Full details of the Labour promises on waiting times are set out in appendix 2 in the briefing paper on the health mission. This is what Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said in her clip for broadcasters when she was asked if she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course for her, after she was caught speeding, so that she would not have to attend a group speed awareness course. She replied: First and foremost, I’m focused on the priorities for the British people as home secretary. That’s cutting serious crime with more police officers, that’s standing up for the victims of child sexual abuse, it’s about stopping the boats, and I’m not going to take a backward step from working on those issues. In relation to your question, last summer, I was speeding, I regret that, I paid the fine and I took the points. But we’re focused now on delivering for the British people and working for them. Asked again if she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course for her, she said: What I will say is that, in my view, I’m confident that nothing untoward has happened. Asked if she would welcome an inquiry into this, she ignored the question and instead said she hoped the media would focus on her announcement today about the victims of child sexual abuse. (See 12.28pm.) Suella Braverman has arrived at Downing Street for a meeting, the BBC reports. As she got out of her ministerial car, a reporter asked if she had broken the ministerial code. In reply, she just said she was trying to “stop the boats”. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has said she is “confident that nothing untoward happened” in relation to claims she asked civil servants if they could help her to attend a private speed awareness course after she was caught speeding. Asked about the story in a clip for broadcasters, she said: What I will say is that, in my view, I’m confident that nothing untoward has happened. Braverman said that she was caught speeding, that she paid the fine and took the points. But she refused to discuss exactly what dealings she did have with her civil servants on this, and she did not deny asking them for help. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, will be in the Commons for questions at 2.30pm. She will also give a statement, after Rishi Sunak’s G7 statement, about the government’s response to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA). She will be announcing a redress scheme for victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in England, No 10 says. No 10 also confirmed that Rishi Sunak will give a statement to MPs this afternoon about the G7 summit. If there are no urgent questions, it will be at 3.30pm. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has said that Rishi Sunak’s failure to order an inquiry into claims Suella Braverman broke the ministerial code mean he’s “weak”. Rishi Sunak has spoken to Sir Laurie Magnus, his ethics adviser, about Suella Braverman, but has not (yet?) decided to order an inquiry into whether she broke the ministerial code, No 10 says. These are the top lines from the lobby briefing. Rishi Sunak has spoken to Sir Laurie Magnus, his ethics adviser, about Suella Braverman, the No 10 spokesperson said. As of now, an inquiry has not been launched into allegations that she broke the ministerial code, but the spokesperson did not rule out an update on this later. He told journalists: The prime minister remains clear that integrity, professionalism and accountability are core values. As you would expect, the prime minister has been availing himself of information having just returned from the G7 this morning. I obviously can’t comment on ongoing private conversations, including with independent advisers, but I will endeavour to keep you updated. The spokesperson would not say whether or not Sunak has spoken to Braverman about the issue this morning. Asked if the pair had had a conversation, the spokesperson said: I obviously wouldn’t get into specific conversations but the prime minister, as you would expect, is in regular conversation with the home secretary. The spokesperson insisted Sunak remained committed to “integrity, professionalism and accountability”. The spokesperson said Sunak thought special advisers should tell the truth to journalists. He said this in response to reports that Braverman’s adviser repeatedly told the Daily Mirror that she had not been caught speeding. The full text of Keir Starmer’s speech on the NHS this morning is here. And here is the Labour briefing paper giving details of Labour’s health mission. This is the third of Labour’s five missions for which details have been set out. Here is the briefing on the growth/economy mission, and here is the briefing on the crime one. Margaret Ferrier MP has lost her appeal against the Commons standards committee ruling that she should be suspended for 30 days for breaking Covid rules during the pandemic. That means her suspension will go ahead, and that means a recall byelection is likely to go ahead in her Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency. The byelection will only take place if 10% of electors in the constituency sign a petition calling for one, but it is very likely that this threshold will be met. Ferrier won the seat for the SNP in 2019 with a majority of 5,230 over Labour, but with the SNP’s popularity falling since the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon, and the party’s finances being the subject of a police investigation, Labour is hopeful of being able to win the seat. In a report, the independent expert panel, which considered Ferrier’s appeal against the punishment proposed by the standards committee, said the 30-day suspension was fair. It said: This has undoubtedly been a distressing and humiliating experience for [Ferrier] … She is hugely apologetic and remorseful for her conduct. The consequences for her and her family have been dire. In our judgment, however, [Ferrier] failed to conduct herself in accordance with the standards of conduct expected of individual MPs. She acted with blatant and deliberate dishonest intent. She acted with a high degree of recklessness to the public and to colleagues and staff at the House of Commons. She acted selfishly, putting her own interests above the public interest. There could therefore be no lesser sanction for this conduct. Turning back to Suella Braverman, the PCS civil service union has joined the FDA (see 9.05am) in criticising the home secretary for asking officials about arranging a private speed awareness course. In a statement the PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: Breaking the ministerial code doesn’t appear so much to be a lapse of judgment as a pattern of behaviour. Suella Braverman is quick to criticise civil servants when it suits her, but even quicker to ask for their help when she needs it. Civil servants’ role is to deliver government policy not to act as her personal assistants. How many more lives will Rishi Sunak give her? This is double standards. If she was a PCS member she would not expect to be treated so leniently. Q: Why do you think Labour underperformed in Harlow in the local elections? Starmer says when he became leader, people did not think Labour could win the next election. Now it is on a trajectory where it could form a majority government. People feel that everything is broken, and that they are worse off than 13 years ago, he says. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Starmer took more questions than he normally does at these events (although, if anything, his answers were shorter, and less revealing, than usual). Q: How much have you set aside for renewing the NHS estate? And will you use public private partnerships? Starmer says Labour will have to address the quality of the NHS estate. The legacy is terrible, he says. But he does not just want to “fix the problems” and put it back where it was 13 years ago. That would not be ambitious enough, he says. Q: Do you want to see health spending as a proportion of overall government spending going up? Starmer says he wants to see NHS money spent effectively. That could make “a huge difference”, he says. Before the election, Labour will set out where it would spend extra money, and where the funding would come from, he says. But he says, again, thinking that “everything is about money” is to look at this in the wrong way. Change and reform are as important, he says. Q: Do you think the NHS is instutionally racist? And how would you reduce racial inequalities in health outcomes? Starmer says he is not here to criticise the NHS. But he says inequalities need to be addressed. Q: Would you continue with the plan to build or upgrade 40 hospitals? Starmer says it is hard to continue with a plan that is not a plan. These 40 new hospitals are pretty mythical, he says. But he says Labour will need to ensure buildings are properly maintained. Q: Are you ruling out a salt or sugar tax for good? Starmer says his focus today is on limits on advertising unhealthy foods. Q: Would you give nurses a further pay rise? And do you think consultants should get a higher pay rise? Starmer says this government has lasted as long as the last Labour one. Under Labour, nurses were paid fairly, and nurses did not go on strike. Now no one quarrels with the idea that the NHS is on its knees. The only debate is whether it is on its knees or on its face. Q: You have not said anything about social care. Is it no longer a priority? Starmer says it still is a priority. Labour has set out a plan for staff in the care sector. He says his sister works in this sector, so he knows it well. Labour would improve career progression options for carers, he says. And it would encourage more people to be looked after at home. Q: How much will these plans cost? Starmer says specific proposals have been costed. And he says technology can reduce costs. Earlier cancer diagnosis would cut costs. And merging waiting lists, so the people can be seen in different hospitals, would cut costs. He says he understands why journalists are asking these questions about costs. But he says he has run a public service. He knows it is not all about funding. Q: You seem to be kicking the issue of money into the long grass. How can people trust you if you won’t say how will will pay for this? And why won’t you say if you will pay NHS staff more? Starmer says, where Labour has proposed measures that would cost more, it has said how it would fund that. For example, it would fund training more doctors and nurses by abolishing non-dom tax status. On NHS staff, he says his wife works for the NHS, so he knows what NHS staff think. They are worried about whether the NHS will continue to exist. That worry is fair, he says. They are very pleased about the plan to train more staff. Starmer is now taking questions. Q: Would the NHS get more money overall under Labour? Starmer says it is not all about money. Money is part of the solution. But change is important too. The NHS needs to use technology more effectively, he says. Starmer says Labour would let patients visit nearby hospitals for treatment if faster treatment is available there than is available at their local one. Starmer says Labour would zone in on the biggest killers. He says it would get heart attacks and strokes down by a quarter within a decade. On cancer, Labour would ensure 75% of all cancer is diagnosed at stage one or two. He says the survival rate for cancer at stage one or two is 81%. But at stage three or four it is just 26%. And, on suicide, he says Labour would reverse the number of deaths by suicide. He says he has had three friends die this way. Suicide is the biggest killer of young lives in this country, he says. Starmer says Labour would improve healthy life expectancy for all, and halve the health inequality gap between different regions of England. He says this would restart a trend we should take for granted – that over time people live longer, and happier lives. This would make Britain fairer too, he says. Starmer is now giving details of his health missions. He says Labour would ensure that ambulances arrive within seven minutes for cardiac arrests, that people do not have to wait for more than four hours at A&amp;E, and that GP satisfaction ratings reach record levels. Starmer thanks people working in the NHS. Without them, there would be no light at the end of the tunnel, he says. He says the reward for reform will be worth it. And the Tories will never deliver this, he claims. They voted against it at the start. And, although they claim to support it now, he says in their heart of hearts they don’t. They see it as “a cost, not a cause”. It does not fit in with their vision of a small-state Britain. He says the Tories also underestimate the NHS, and the importance of the bond that it creates between people. Starmer says the NHS is “not sustainable unless we make serious, deep, long-term changes”. That is his plan, he says. He wants to make it fit for the future. He says money is part of this. He will set out Labour’s plans before the election, based on economic circumstances at the time, he says. But he says what is “more important” is to set out Labour’s recipe for reform. Keir Starmer has just started giving his speech on his health missions. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. He says he does not think the NHS could survive another five years of Tory government. If people doubt that, they should listen to those who work in it. At the next election, the NHS will be on the line, he says. The Tories would “put it in the ground”. UPDATE: Starmer said: I don’t think the NHS survives five more years of Tory government … At the next election, the NHS is on the line. The Conservative party that has brought it to its knees will put it in the ground. In his Today programme interview Keir Starmer was asked at length about his approach to net immigration, and whether he wanted overall numbers to fall. This issue has been a problem for the Conservative party ever since David Cameron rashly promised to get annual net immigration below 100,000, and Rishi Sunak was criticised at the end of last week for saying he is no longer aiming to get annual net immigration below 220,000, the pledge implied by the 2019 Tory manifesto, but just below 500,000, the level he inherited. Figures out on Thursday are expected to show the figure for 2022 running at 700,000 or more. Starmer said that he wanted and expected annual net immigration to fall during the first term of a Labour government, but he refused to set a target for how much that fall should be. Asked if he would expect the annual figure to fall below 500,000, he replied: I would expect and want that figure to come down, and I’ll tell you for why. A driver of immigration into this country is our failure on the skills agenda. So many businesses across the country say to me, ‘Look we can’t get the skills we need from the UK therefore we’re more or less forced to recruit from abroad’. This is a problem that the government has failed to address for year after year after year. Asked specifically if immigration would come down in the first term of a Labour government, Starmer said: “I would expect it to come down and I would want it to come down.” But, despite being pressed repeatedly what his target would be, Starmer refused to give even an approximate number. He said the Tories had repeatedly set a “hard target” that they had missed. He said he was more interested in indicating the “direction of travel” under Labour. He said: I‘m not going to put a number on it. I think that that’s what the government did in the past. They never met the target. But I would like and want to see, and expect to see, the number coming down. Asked if immigration would fall “significantly” during the first term of a Labour government, Starmer repeated the point about “direction of travel”. When it was put to him that that could mean a fall of just 2,000 or 3,000, he said: “I think it would be more than that.” He said he wanted to reduce immigration by stopping employers being reliant on foreign labour. But he conceded that this was something that would take time. He indicated that he did not want to cut the number of foreign students coming to the UK. He said: I want good students to come to the UK. We’ve got a fantastic story to tell in relation to students. But he said that if, as expected, the government this week announces new restrictions on foreign students bringing their dependents to the UK, Labour would not oppose that. The official statistics watchdog has reprimanded the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, after he claimed public debt levels would fall in the coming years, when in fact they are simply forecast to rise less steeply than previously expected. Peter Walker has the story. Keir Starmer will give a speech this morning providing details about Labour’s “mission” on health. Health is one of the five “missions” – overall strategic aims – he has set for a Labour government, but each mission comes with its own set of targets (sub-missions?), and, as Matthew Weaver and Pippa Crerar report, the health one will include reducing deaths from suicide. Starmer gave more details of his thinking on health in an interview round this morning. Here are some of the points he made. Starmer claimed the NHS was “always better funded under Labour”. The overnight briefing from Labour about his speech suggests that he is not going to promise extra money for the NHS in what he announces this morning. But when asked about funding, he told the Today programme: Money is part of the answer and the NHS is always better funded under Labour. But he also implied that change was just as important as better funding in achieving better NHS outcomes. He told BBC Breakfast: So far as the money is concerned, firstly, wherever we’ve made a specific commitment we’re setting out in terms today how we’ll pay for that. I ran a public service for five years, I do know that if you put more money in the top you do get a better outcome, so money is, of course, part of the answer, but we’ve also got to change and reform. If we go down the path of prevention, that actually will not only be a lot better for people’s lives and their health, but also, in the long run, actually cost a lot less. He said Labour was committed to hitting the target for people to be seen within four hours at A&amp;E within the first term of a Labour government. But he said that some of his ambitions for the NHS would take “a bit longer”. He confirmed that he was opposed to putting new taxes on unhealthy food or drinks. He told Radio 5 Live: We don’t want to go down the road of making food more expensive in the middle of a cost of living crisis, which is why today we’ll focus on advertising rather than increasing the cost to food, because I think for many families who are already struggling, the idea that food prices would go up again is something which simply wouldn’t be tolerable from their point of view. But he said his “very strong view” was that sugary food, and vaping, should not be advertised to children. He said: In the speech, I’m going to deal with vaping and junk food and sugary foods, which should not be advertised to children in my very strong view. It’s so bad for their health, so bad for the NHS. Good morning. Rishi Sunak is back from Japan, and this morning he is due to meet Sir Laurie Magnus, his ethics adviser, to discuss whether Magnus should launch an inquiry into claims that Suella Braverman, the home secretary, broke the ministerial code when she asked officials about arranging a private speed awareness course after she was caught speeding. These courses are meant to be group events, but Braverman did not want a bunch of strangers to know she was taking part. Given the controversy this story has aroused, it will be surprising if Sunak does not order an inquiry. Here is Pippa Crerar’s overnight story. On the BBC’s Westminster Hour last night Philip Rycroft, a former permanent secretary at the Brexit department, said he thought Braverman had broken the ministerial code. He told the programme: This, on the face of it, I think, is a breach of the ministerial code. Obviously, there’s still investigations to be done and so on but the code is very clear. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests. Even asking a question of a civil servant as to how she might go on one of these courses puts them in an impossible position. And for somebody, you know, who wakes up in the morning and sees a future prime minister, this is a real lapse of judgment. And this morning Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants, said he thought Braverman has abused her position. He told Sky News: Civil servants are publicly funded. They’re paid for by you and me. They’re not there to support the personal interests of a minister. They don’t do their shopping, they don’t look after their children and they don’t sort out their speeding fine. In truth, as breaches of the ministerial code go, this seems to be at the mild end of what might count, and if this story were about a more anonymous member of the cabinet (Mel Stride, Gillian Keegan?), it would be attracting far less attention. But Braverman is not an anonymous minister, which is why this issue is a problem for Sunak. She has already had to resign once for breaching the ministerial code, for sending an official document from her personal email to a fellow MP. She has set herself up as the de facto leader of a Tory faction pushing for a much harder stance on legal and illegal immigration, to the extent that she sometimes gives the impression that she wants to be sacked. But this has also given her a following, and her allies are briefing the media that she is the victim of a smear campaign. This morning Keir Starmer said that if Braverman has broken the ministerial code, she should resign. Peter Walker has the story here. “The ministerial code is pretty clear that if you break it, you’re supposed to go,” Starmer said. In fact, Starmer is wrong about that. The code used to operate on that basis, but guidance from No 10 issued last year says that if a minister has broken the code, in some circumstances a public apology would be the appropriate sanction. It says: As both Lord Geidt and the Committee on Standards in Public Life have recommended last year, it is disproportionate to expect that any breach, however minor, should lead automatically to resignation or dismissal. The sanction which the prime minister may decide to issue in a given case is for the prime minister to determine, but could include requiring some form of public apology, remedial action or removal of ministerial salary for a period. The ministerial code has been updated to reflect this. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.25am: Keir Starmer gives a speech on Labour’s health mission. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Suella Braverman, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Rishi Sunak is expected to make a Commons statement on the G7 summit. After 4.30pm: MPs debate Labour amendments to the strikes (minimum service levels) bill. 5pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives a speech in Chile.

The scheme is in response to the findings of a seven-year inquiry that revealed failings by schools, local authorities and other institutions to protect and safeguard the children in their care. The announcement, made in the Commons by the home secretary, Suella Braverman, followed the publication last October of a report by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), which found children had faced “limitless” cruelty with the complicity of institutions. The 458-page report made 20 recommendations, not all of which have been adopted by the government. The chair of the inquiry later described the government’s measures as deeply disappointing. The government said victims, survivors and charities would be consulted on a number of areas of the scheme, including on who it should support and how non-state institutions should be involved. In addition to the redress scheme, ministers launched a 12-week public call for evidence on a new legal duty that will require those who work with children and young people to report if they suspect a child is being sexually abused or exploited. The government also pledged to look at ways to improve access to therapeutic support for victims and survivors, and the way in which police collect data on child sexual abuse to better understand the scale and nature of the crime. Prof Alexis Jay, who chaired the inquiry, and the inquiry’s victims and survivors consultative panel, issued a statement warning the government package as it stood would not adequately protect children from sexual abuse. “After taking evidence from 725 witnesses during 325 days of public hearings, hearing from over 6,000 victims and survivors of child sexual abuse during our truth project and producing 52 reports, we published a concluding report in October last year, which included 20 recommendations,” the statement said. “These recommendations were a carefully considered set of measures, designed to complement each other to provide a comprehensive world-class framework for the protection of children. We are deeply disappointed that the government has not accepted the full package of recommendations made in the final report. “The package announced by the government today will not provide the protection from sexual abuse that our children deserve. We ask the government to reconsider and accept and enact all our recommendations in full.” IICSA Changemakers, a new alliance set up to inspire a national mission to prevent child sexual abuse, expressed concern about the lack of meaningful support for children and adult survivors. “The commitments that have been made do not translate to immediate action which would achieve the scale of change required to create and sustain a national movement to prevent, recognise, and address child sexual abuse.” The inquiry considered 4.2m pieces of written evidence from charities, institutions and witnesses and explored failings in both state and non-state institutions, including government departments, the police, schools, local authorities, religious organisations, political parties and the armed services in England and Wales. The home secretary said: “No apology or compensation can turn the clock back on the harrowing abuse these victims suffered, but it is important survivors have that suffering recognised and acknowledged. That is what the compensation scheme will deliver.” The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, added: “We will stop at nothing to stamp out these vile crimes, punish the perpetrators, and make sure every child across the country can grow up in a safe environment.” Ian Dean, the director of the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse, said: “It is vital that the government honours its commitments to victims and survivors, and to protecting children today from sexual abuse in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/top-home-office-mandarin-knew-of-bravermans-alleged-speeding-request","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:58:21Z","webTitle":"Top Home Office mandarin knew of Braverman’s alleged speeding request","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/top-home-office-mandarin-knew-of-bravermans-alleged-speeding-request","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/top-home-office-mandarin-knew-of-bravermans-alleged-speeding-request","fields":{"headline":"Top Home Office mandarin knew of Braverman’s alleged speeding request","bodyText":"The most senior civil servant in the Home Office was made aware of allegations that Suella Braverman wanted civil service help in dealing with a speeding fine, the Guardian understands. The development raises questions about how many other senior officials and ministers across Whitehall were then informed about the claims, and puts pressure on the prime minister to order an investigation into the allegations. Matthew Rycroft, the department’s permanent secretary, was told about the home secretary’s alleged request to set up a private driving awareness course in the autumn, informed sources said. Braverman had made the request to another senior civil servant who “had concerns about whether it was appropriate”, it is understood, so had reported it to the top official. The home secretary insisted she had done “nothing untoward” as she battled to save her job. She admitted speeding, and said she had paid a fine and taken penalty points on her licence, but did not deny asking officials for help. Her team have suggested that she did not instruct officials to arrange a course, but merely asked for their advice. That has been disputed by sources elsewhere in government. Rishi Sunak is still considering whether to order an investigation into allegations the home secretary breached the ministerial code by asking taxpayer-funded officials to assist with a private matter. Downing Street pointedly refused to back Braverman’s assertions that she had done nothing wrong after the speeding charge last year, instead saying Sunak was “availing” himself of the information. The prime minister confirmed that he had spoken to his ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, over the issue, although no formal inquiry has yet begun. The adviser cannot begin an investigation without Sunak’s authorisation. During a statement in the Commons on the G7, he said: “I have always been clear that where issues like this are raised, they should be dealt with properly and they should be dealt with professionally. “I have been receiving information on the issues raised, I have met with both the independent adviser and the home secretary. I have asked for further information and I will update on the appropriate course of action in due course.” When taking his seat in the Commons prior to his statement, Sunak was seen patting Braverman on the back in a visible show of support. Magnus could request all emails and messages sent within the Home Office and between departments if he is asked to investigate the matter. One source said that Braverman’s request to officials was in email form, meaning Magnus could see it. The civil servant who was approached by Braverman was working as an acting staff member in her office, it is understood. The temporary role was meant to help ease the home secretary into her new position after the recent sacking of her predecessor, Priti Patel. Sources said the civil servant “was concerned” about the request and informed Rycroft. The Home Office has been approached for a comment. In her first public comments on the row, Braverman did not deny asking civil servants to intervene. Asked directly about the claims, she said: “Last summer, I was speeding. I regret that. I paid the fine and I took the points but we’re focused now on delivering for the British people and working for them.” Pressed on the same question, she said: “In relation to the process, I’m focused on delivering for the British people, doing my job as home secretary and what I will say is that, in my view, I’m confident that nothing untoward has happened.” The home secretary then appeared for a regular session of Home Office questions in the Commons, telling MPs: “I paid the fine and I took the penalty and at no point did I attempt to evade sanction.” Discussions between senior figures in No 10 and the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics office over the weekend continued into Monday. With Sunak still to make a decision about whether to launch an inquiry, Whitehall insiders suggested that he was “gaining a reputation for being indecisive”. There was said to have been “no hold-up” from the Cabinet Office’s side, with all information held by the department provided to Downing Street. Braverman’s aides had sought to get the government to publish a bulleted timeline explaining what happened when – but been blocked from doing so. Many Tory MPs still think there could be a reasonable explanation for Braverman asking questions about whether she could take the speed awareness course. But they still want her to “come clean”. A government source said Braverman’s “inability to answer straight questions in the Commons” had rattled nerves. Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the defence select committee, told Times Radio on Monday: “MPs get speeding fines as do members of the public, I think we’ve got a couple of ministers that have been banned from driving, you know, they put their hand up, they pay their fine. “What you don’t do is pull strings or use your connections to try and cover up what you’re doing or find an easier route out.” Allies of the home secretary defended her, with former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg suggesting there was no need for an investigation. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “I would have thought the prime minister could think this through pretty clearly, that this is not a big story.” He added: “What goes on in private offices is that a minister is busy, has many things to do and sometimes will ask for something that civil servants can’t do. But as long as, once they’ve said no, you accept it, then you haven’t done anything wrong.” Philip Rycroft, former permanent secretary at the Brexit department, told the BBC: “This, on the face of it, I think, is a breach of the ministerial code. The code is very clear. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said Braverman should resign if she is found to have broken the ministerial code. Sanctions for lesser misdemeanours include a public apology and docking pay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/press-campaigners-threatened-to-destroy-me-private-investigator-tells-court","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:54:26Z","webTitle":"Private investigator tells phone-hacking trial of threat to ‘destroy’ him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/press-campaigners-threatened-to-destroy-me-private-investigator-tells-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/press-campaigners-threatened-to-destroy-me-private-investigator-tells-court","fields":{"headline":"Private investigator tells phone-hacking trial of threat to ‘destroy’ him","bodyText":"Press reform campaigners threatened to “destroy” a private investigator because he refused to help their campaign against newspaper groups, it has been alleged at the high court. Paul Hawkes, a veteran private investigator, said claims that he hacked Hugh Grant’s emails on behalf of the Daily Mirror were “fantastical” and “made-up”. After being presented with a supposed invoice for the work, Hawkes mocked the idea he would have carried out such a serious act for such a small sum, telling the court: “You’re saying I got it hacked by a third party for £150? Come on!” Hawkes told Prince Harry’s phone-hacking trial that his company always kept on the right side of the law when targeting individuals, including the former television presenter Robert Kilroy-Silk, saying: “What we did was clever, legal, and costs more.” In response to accusations he “blagged” celebrities’ personal records by impersonating them on the phone to call centres, Hawkes said: “You don’t have to pretend to be anybody to talk to somebody … sometimes there are ruses. The ruses are not illegal.” Prince Harry and more than 100 other claimants are suing Mirror Group Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and People. Over the last week the court has heard allegations of widespread illegal behaviour at those newspapers, with witnesses now being called for the defence. Hawkes told the court he felt pressured into turning evidence against the newspaper group when approached in 2016 by journalist Dan Evans, a former phone hacker who now reports wrongdoing in the British media for the website Byline Investigates. The duo initially had a cordial discussion about tabloid tactics, the private investigator said: “[Evans] seemed proud that he was no longer involved with hacking and described himself and his colleague [Graham] Johnson as ‘poachers turned gamekeepers’.” Hawkes said the conversation turned sour when he declined to assist their investigations into the British media, saying: “Mr Evans then proceeded to try and threaten me. He talked to me about getting me ‘on side’, arguing that it was in my best interests … When it became clear that I could not help him, Mr Evans told me that if I was not willing to play ball then they would destroy me [and my company] Research Associates through costly litigation. I understood ‘they’ to mean [press reform group] Hacked Off and their lawyers.” Evans, who gave evidence against Mirror Group Newspapers earlier in the trial, disputed this recollection and said he had never worked for Hacked Off. In a witness statement Evans said he felt “empathy” towards Hawkes and simply wanted to warn the private investigator about the “extreme stress and expense involved” of being involved in a phone-hacking trial. “There was no easy way to have this conversation and I could tell he was upset from his body language. His reaction was to threaten to conduct what he termed ‘due diligence’ into me.” Hawkes insisted that most of his work for newspapers was based on open source intelligence. However, he later accepted that part of a witness statement describing his work had been copied and pasted from Wikipedia. David Sherborne, the barrister for Harry and the other claimants, said this showed Hawkes’s evidence was unreliable, saying: “You’re blagging this court.” Earlier in the day the court heard evidence from former Mirror chief executive Sly Bailey, who “categorically” denied having any knowledge of illegal behaviour at the newspapers she ran between 2003 and 2012. Bailey told the court she was “deeply regretful” but had “never orchestrated a cover-up of anything” and only learned of the illegal behaviour by journalists at her company after she left. Mirror Group Newspapers has since paid out settlements to hundreds of victims of phone hacking, mainly relating to the period when Bailey was chief executive. Bailey told the court that in 2007, following the first criminal prosecutions for phone hacking, she summoned newspaper editors Richard Wallace, Tina Weaver, and Mark Thomas to her office and asked them to confirm they were not involved in phone hacking. She said: “They confirmed to me they were not involved in illegal activity.” Sherborne, the claimants’ barrister, said this was not enough due diligence, asking Bailey: “You asked an editor saying ‘have you hacked phones’ and they say ‘no’ and that’s it?” Sherborne mocked the idea that, as the chief executive of a company listed on the stock market, Bailey would not have read a 2003 report in the Guardian suggesting footballer Rio Ferdinand’s phone had been hacked by one of her newspapers. Bailey said she did not recall the article, telling the court: “I wasn’t a Guardian reader.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:39:40Z","webTitle":"Facebook owner Meta fined €1.2bn for mishandling user information","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta","fields":{"headline":"Facebook owner Meta fined €1.2bn for mishandling user information","bodyText":"Facebook’s owner, Meta, has been fined a record €1.2bn (£1bn) and ordered to suspend the transfer of user data from the EU to the US. The fine – equivalent to $1.3bn – imposed by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which regulates Meta across the EU, is a record for a breach of the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The suspension of Facebook data transfers is not immediate and Meta has been given five months to implement it. The DPC punishment relates to a legal challenge brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that European users’ data is not sufficiently protected from US intelligence agencies when it is transferred across the Atlantic. Meta has also been given six months to stop “the unlawful processing, including storage, in the US” of personal EU data already transferred across the Atlantic, meaning that user data will need to be removed from Facebook servers. The ruling does not affect data transfers at Meta’s other main platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta said it would appeal against the decision and seek a stay on the data transfer order. The DPC said Meta infringed GDPR by continuing to transfer EU user data to the US without proper safeguards in place, despite a ruling by the European court of justice in 2020 requiring robust protection of that information. The CJEU ruled that data leaving the EU must have the same level of protection as it would have under GDPR when it reaches its destination outside the EU. The regulator said data transferred by Facebook under a legal instrument called standard contractual clauses (SCCs) “did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects that were identified by the [court of justice] in its judgment”. Meta, whose EU base is in Ireland, said it had been “singled out” by the DPC despite thousands of other businesses using the same data transfer processes. “We are … disappointed to have been singled out when using the same legal mechanism as thousands of other companies looking to provide services in Europe,” wrote Nick Clegg, the Meta president of global affairs, and Jennifer Newstead, the Meta chief legal officer, in a blog post on Monday. Clegg and Newstead added: “This decision is flawed, unjustified and sets a dangerous precedent for the countless other companies transferring data between the EU and US.” They said the internet risked being carved up into national and regional silos as a result. A spokesperson for the European Commission – the EU’s executive arm – said it hoped a new framework for transatlantic data transfers would be “fully functional by the summer” which would provide the “stability and legal certainty” sought by US tech companies. Facebook would be able to resume data transfers under the new data regime, which has been agreed between Washington and Brussels at a political level but still requires agreement on implementation. The spokesperson said it was “very clear” that the EU had worked with the US on putting “safeguards” protecting consumer data in place and it hoped to restore legal certainty. The Meta blog said there would be “no immediate disruption” to Facebook’s service in the EU because of the grace period announced by the DPC. However, in Meta’s most recent quarterly results, the company said that without SCCs or “other alternative means of data transfers” it would “likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe”. Meta reported net income, a US measure of profit, of $23.2bn last year. Shares in Meta were up 2.2% in midday trading on Monday, valuing the company at more than $640bn. The DPC said it had disagreed with other EU regulators over Meta’s punishment, which resulted in the European Data Protection Board, comprised of EU data watchdogs, stepping in to decide whether a fine should be imposed. The previous record GDPR fine was €746m imposed on Amazon by Luxembourg in 2021. Eddie Powell, a data protection partner at UK law firm Fladgate, said an appeal was unlikely to reverse all of the decision. “At the heart of the issue is the US government’s ability under US law to access EU personal data held by US corporations on the grounds of national security, without any effective safeguard or checks,’” he said. Powell added that the fine reflected the fact that “Meta’s systems were structured so that all data collected on its social media platforms had to be sent to the US, without any kind of firebreak”. Mark Deem, a partner at the UK law firm Wiggin, said the size of the fine would send a message to other businesses that transfer personal data outside the EU. “One of the purposes of the figure is to serve as a warning to other companies about how they handle international data transfers,” he said. The UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, said: “We have noted the decision and will review the details in due course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/woman-died-home-waiting-over-five-hours-ambulance-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:29:34Z","webTitle":"Woman died on floor after waiting over five hours for ambulance in Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/woman-died-home-waiting-over-five-hours-ambulance-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/woman-died-home-waiting-over-five-hours-ambulance-wales","fields":{"headline":"Woman died on floor after waiting over five hours for ambulance in Wales","bodyText":"A 58-year-old woman died alone curled up in a blanket on the floor of her bedroom as she waited more than five hours for an ambulance. Relatives of Rachel Rose Gibson believe she had a heart attack at her home in Wrexham, north Wales, only a short drive away from a hospital, but died before an ambulance reached her. The Welsh ambulance service said that on the day Gibson died, its crews spent more than 700 hours waiting outside hospitals for patients to be admitted, which meant they could not respond quickly to people needing help. Family members said Gibson, a grandmother of seven, called an ambulance at 4pm on 5 April as she was coughing up blood and in chronic pain. By the time an ambulance arrived at 9.30pm, she had died. Her daughter, Nikita, 29, said: “She was lying on the floor curled up in a blanket. It haunts me to know she died alone in so much pain. “I feel like I can’t fully grieve because I’m so angry. She only lives five minutes away from the hospital, but must have been in too much pain to get into a taxi.” The family is waiting for test results to confirm her cause of death, but Nikita Gibson said she had been told it may have been a heart attack. She added: “It’s disgusting that we are using ambulances as waiting rooms. My mum was in need. She should have been a priority.” Liam Williams, the executive director of quality and nursing at the Welsh ambulance service, said an investigation would be carried out. He said: “On April 5, our ambulance crews spent over 700 hours outside hospitals across Wales waiting to hand patients over to our hospital colleagues, which in turn meant that our ambulances couldn’t respond to those waiting in the community. I would like to reinforce our sincere apologies and regret to anyone who has had a poor experience from us.” In April the ambulance service in Wales lost more than 23,000 hours at hospitals across Wales – the equivalent of 2,000 shifts. Michelle Greene, of Betsi Cadwaladr university health board, said: “We continue to face challenges to discharge patients from hospital to suitable accommodation or care services. “This does impact flow through the entire hospital system, and on our ability to bring patients into and through the emergency department in a timely manner and we continue to work with our health and social care partners to improve this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/junior-doctors-in-england-to-strike-for-three-further-days-in-june","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:16:14Z","webTitle":"Junior doctors in England to strike for three further days in June","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/junior-doctors-in-england-to-strike-for-three-further-days-in-june","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/junior-doctors-in-england-to-strike-for-three-further-days-in-june","fields":{"headline":"Junior doctors in England to strike for three further days in June","bodyText":"Junior doctors in England will stage a fresh strike for three days next month after negotiations with ministers failed to resolve their pay dispute. The 72-hour stoppage will run from 7am on Wednesday 14 June to 7am on Saturday 17 June, the British Medical Association announced on Monday evening. It will be the third strike junior doctors have held as part of a campaign to force ministers to give them a 35% pay rise to make up for what they estimate to be a 26.2% fall in the real-terms value of their salaries since 2008. The BMA warned that it would keep striking for at least three days every month “throughout the summer” until their legal mandate for industrial action expires. Junior doctors have already staged a three-day walkout in March and a four-day one over Easter last month. The union blamed the government for next month’s strike and said ministers had only offered junior doctors a “not credible” pay rise of 5%. But Whitehall sources hit back and claimed that at one point during the recent negotiations the BMA proposed a four-year pay deal that would have led to junior doctors getting a 49% increase. A government spokesperson accused the BMA of sticking to its position of making “unaffordable headline demands on pay” and refusing to compromise. The NHS in England may soon be faced with strikes by other staff groups too. The Royal College of Nursing’s second ballot of its members, seeking a legal mandate for another six months of stoppages, opens on Tuesday. And the BMA is also balloting hospital consultants to see if they want to join the junior doctors in striking in pursuit of better pay. Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, the co-chairs of the BMA’s junior doctors committee, disclosed that they had been talking to the health secretary, Steve Barclay, for the last three weeks in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the two walkouts so far, which have hugely disrupted NHS services. But they said negotiations became “unproductive” when Barclay refused to accept that junior doctors’ pay has been significantly eroded over time and needs to be restored to 2008 levels. The talks collapsed on Monday after what turned out to be a final meeting between the sides. Trivedi and Laurenson said they had held three weeks of negotiations with the government since the end of their four-day stoppage last month, which caused huge concern in the NHS. They said that they had entered the talks “in good faith” and hoped that “we would finally see a real offer on the table that would avoid the need for more industrial action. “We made proposals showing our willingness to be creative and work with the government on how the reversal of our pay erosion could be achieved. In the end, however, the government would simply not accept the fundamental reality of the pay cuts junior doctors have faced. “This was made clear when they finally made their pay offer of 5%. Not only is that nowhere near addressing pay erosion over the last 15 years, it would not even have matched inflation this year.” The government spokesperson said it was “surprising and deeply disappointing” that the BMA had called a further strike while “constructive” talks, including about non-pay issues such as junior doctors no longer having to pay to take exams, were continuing. “We made a fair and reasonable opening offer, and were in active discussions about both pay and non-pay issues. “Unfortunately, it seems the BMA is unwilling to move meaningfully away from their unaffordable headline demands on pay.” The BMA said it planned to meet Barclay again on Wednesday. But Barclay will only engage in further talks if the junior doctors call off their strike, which looks unlikely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/not-something-i-am-proud-of-even-leftwing-greeks-turn-to-mitsotakis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:09:34Z","webTitle":"‘Not something I’m proud of’: six Greeks explain their election choice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/not-something-i-am-proud-of-even-leftwing-greeks-turn-to-mitsotakis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/not-something-i-am-proud-of-even-leftwing-greeks-turn-to-mitsotakis","fields":{"headline":"‘Not something I’m proud of’: six Greeks explain their election choice","bodyText":"New Democracy enjoyed a landslide victory in Greece on Sunday that put it far ahead of the leftwing opposition, which fared worse than forecasted. Despite securing 41% of the vote, under new election rules the party remains short of an outright majority and leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said he will push for a repeat poll “as soon as possible”. The staggering result put the incumbent 20 percentage points ahead of Syriza. It followed a wiretapping scandal and a devastating train crash that were expected to affect Mitsotakis’s popularity with the electorate, but many appear to have backed the party they credit with steering the country to economic recovery. Here, six voters share why they voted the way they did. ‘I voted for Mitsotakis because there was no other option’ “I was shocked at the result – it’s almost historic. I voted for New Democracy because practically there was no other option. It was a very difficult decision. I identify as centre or centre-left politically. [Voting for New Democracy] is not something I am exactly proud of doing but, in the past four years, the prime minister has brought in a lot of investors, more jobs have appeared and salaries have increased, albeit marginally. New Democracy has worked hard to modernise the public sector by introducing digitised services. I think it’s better to have a majority government than a coalition. “The main problem with voting Mitsotakis is that not everyone in his party is as centrist as he is, and there are some politicians in there that are quite far right. That is not great. Unfortunately, the other options also have politicians on the extreme ends.” Vittorio Μattioli, 32, copyeditor and small business owner in Athens (New Democracy voter) ‘I voted against New Democracy and its scandals’ “I voted for the main opposition party, Syriza, for a bunch of reasons – being a supporter is not one of them. I was, of course, disappointed at the result. I didn’t expect the gap to be so big, but who did? “Just to name a few reasons I voted against New Democracy: the government was caught red-handed spying on politicians and journalists, [there’s] no funds for education/health and the train crash where there was a lack of monitoring. “Also because of press freedom – a main reason people know little about or hold no one responsible for the above. Refugee pushbacks; police brutality.” Alexandros, 34, academic in Athens (Syriza voter) ‘It was disheartening to see the low turnout’ “This is my first vote in a general election in Greece – I became a Greek citizen last year, largely pushed into that by Brexit after living and working here for 40 years. I wasn’t overly surprised at the result – I thought Mitsotakis would win easily. “I voted for Syriza. I don’t agree with all their platform but I want the country to move back into a more social democratic direction with more emphasis given to health and education. The poor and the lower middle classes suffered mightily in the [economic] crisis and despite all the positive spin being given on the Greek economy, there are huge problems for most with very low wages and increasing prices. “It was disheartening to see the low turnout [about 39% did not vote]. It reflects that people are fed up. There’s a lack of understanding of the reality outside the Athens bubble. Parts of Halkidiki, where I live, are very developed in terms of tourism, but it’s a very short season and there are huge differences in the area. The needs of the community are not covered.” Lesley, 67, retired in Halkidiki (Syriza voter) ‘I worry social inequalities will rise’ “I voted for the leftwing party DiEM25 because I believe they would lobby for the strongest social state. The truth is I didn’t expect Syriza to get such a low percentage, and I was upset that DiEM25 didn’t get into parliament. At least KKE increased its share, so there can be more of a counter. I haven’t decided how I’ll vote in the second round. “To be honest, I don’t think it makes much difference which party wins, the system doesn’t seem to change much. I thought about voting Syriza, in order to weaken New Democracy, which [I view] as the worst choice for my country. But Syriza has disappointed me, and I heard some debates with DiEM25 leader Yanis Varoufakis and he impressed me. “I want to be optimistic about the future and the economy – I hope it becomes easier for young people to stay here and to return to Greece. I’m worried that social inequalities will rise and that my fellow citizens have developed apathy for social concerns. Many people really don’t care about anything than their household.” Georgia Vouka, 24, intern in Thessaloniki (DiEM25 voter) ‘There is only this choice and chaos’ “The result is promising – I thought, this is a more mature result from the electorate. I think Mitsotakis is the only reliable solution to bring progress in this country. It was a very easy decision for me – unfortunately, it’s a choice between New Democracy and chaos. “Voting is not only about political ideology, but also about politicians. It’s about politicians’ moral ground, technical expertise, pragmatism and results. I judge politicians by their actions, not their promises. Mitsotakis may not be ideal but he has brought results. “Though I would define myself as being closer to a socialist ideology, I think Pasok are mainly to blame for our debt crisis. I don’t feel I can trust them for this reason. Syriza is being led by people who [ignored] the result of the 2015 austerity referendum, turning no into yes – that’s the level of trust I have for them.” Tina, 39, lawyer in Athens (New Democracy voter) ‘I voted New Democracy for the economy’ “I belong to the centre-left, but I will vote with a heavy heart for the centre-right New Democracy party. The reason is the economy of the country. Greece has suffered a lot economically in recent years and, in contrast to a disastrous four years of Syriza, the last four years of New Democracy have seen an impressive recovery. “As well as the economy of the country, Syriza’s Euroscepticism and its refusal of necessary public sector reforms guaranteed its overwhelming defeat. I wish for changes in the area of the centre-left and the creation of a truly pro-European modern party formation.” Charalampos, 67, retired in Athens (New Democracy voter)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/labour-government-invest-more-nhs-england-starmer-five-missions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T18:07:46Z","webTitle":"Labour government would invest more in NHS England, says Starmer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/labour-government-invest-more-nhs-england-starmer-five-missions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/labour-government-invest-more-nhs-england-starmer-five-missions","fields":{"headline":"Labour government would invest more in NHS England, says Starmer","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has signalled that a Labour government would pump more funding into the NHS in England as he outlined his plans to make the health service “fit for the future”. The Labour leader agreed that he was prepared to put his “money where [his] mouth is” on investing in the future of the health service. He told the BBC: “Yes, money is part of the answer and the NHS is always better funded under Labour”. Some Labour MPs are concerned that Starmer is too cautious over his spending plans. They argue that the health service will not be able to “get off its knees” without substantial investment and that the public would expect that. Before a speech in Essex to launch the latest of his five “missions” for government, Starmer acknowledged that Labour would need to pour more money into the NHS. “So far as the money is concerned, firstly, wherever we have made a specific commitment we are setting out in terms today how we will pay for that,” he told the BBC. “But also I do want to emphasise, I ran a public service for five years, I do know that if you put more money in the top you do get a better outcome, so money is of course part of the answer, but we have also got to change and reform. “And if we go down the path of prevention, that actually will be far better for people’s lives and their health but also, actually, in the long run cost a lot less.” He promised to set out a comprehensive breakdown of Labour’s funding plans for the NHS in advance of next year’s election, depending on the state of the public finances at the time. However, after his speech, Starmer sidestepped questions on exactly how the party would fund wide-ranging NHS reform in the longer term. He denied that he had not set out where the money would come from, highlighting that Labour has said it will pay for “the biggest workforce expansion in NHS history” by scrapping non-dom tax status, which could raise £3.2bn a year. While there was little mention of Labour’s social care plans, Starmer stressed they remained a priority. A review commissioned by the party from the Fabian Society last summer will report next month on how a new “national care service” could be structured and funded, according to a spokesperson. A Labour source admitted there were some details yet to be announced about the party’s spending plans in the run-up to the next election – including on areas such as health – but stressed this was because “we don’t know the full extent of the fiscal situation we’re going to inherit”. Starmer said the health service was “on its knees” and “at the next election, the NHS is on the line”. He promised to ensure the health service meets targets that are being missed, including a seven-minute response time for cardiac arrests, a four-hour wait to be seen in A&amp;E and planned treatment within 18 weeks. Further aspirations – stemming the number of deaths by suicide and reducing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes by a quarter – may not be achieved until the second term of a Labour government. Although Starmer ruled out imposing a sugar tax to deter people from eating unhealthy food and contributing to growing problems with obesity, he was urged not to be deterred by fears of “nanny-statism”. Dr Aveek Bhattacharya, research director at the Social Market Foundation, said Labour should be “more open to regulating the availability of unhealthy food and drink, minimum unit pricing of alcohol, and higher taxes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/22/how-does-train-wifi-work-and-why-is-it-under-threat-in-england","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:59:15Z","webTitle":"How does train wifi work and why is it under threat in England?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/22/how-does-train-wifi-work-and-why-is-it-under-threat-in-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/22/how-does-train-wifi-work-and-why-is-it-under-threat-in-england","fields":{"headline":"How does train wifi work and why is it under threat in England?","bodyText":"Wifi for train passengers in England may be axed as the government seeks to cut costs. The move is being pushed by the Department for Transport in order to cut costs as it looks to “reform all aspects of the railway” and provide “value for money”. But how does it work, and will this prove a false economy? How does onboard wifi work? Most train wifi ultimately depends on the broader mobile communications network. The train’s antennae pick up the signal – usually 3G or 4G – from regular masts or base stations near the tracks and connects passengers via routers in carriages. Establishing a wifi connection is straightforward on most trains. However, the actual speed or connectivity to the internet depends on the network signal and how the bandwidth is divided up between how many users. Can’t people just use their phone data? That is what the DfT seems to be hoping. But there are several practical reasons why this does not work. While train wifi and phones are affected by patchy network coverage – particularly in rural areas – train antennae outside the metal carriages usually perform far better, and in places can connect via networks in tunnels or to station wifi. Aggregating the demand through one connection or gateway to the train should work better for more people overall, with train wifi systems working to maximise and smooth connectivity from different mobile networks, satellite or wifi. While a growing number of people have access to modern smartphones with unlimited data packages, many still prefer or need wifi. How long have passenger trains in Britain had wifi? Long-distance operators provided basic, paid-for wifi as early as 2004, and franchisees were even fined for failing to install it on trains in 2010. Faster and free wifi was rolled out across most trains after 2014, using a £50m fine levied on Network Rail for poor performance. In 2017, the government said it was launching the next phase – of fast-enough 5G connectivity on trains to allow passengers to stream movies, to make journeys “enjoyable and productive … and deliver economic benefits for the whole of the UK”, along with installing trackside masts to boost signals to trains. In practice, installing bespoke trackside communications infrastructure has proved too costly and complex for most of the railway. So what has changed? Covid and changing travel patterns have led to a decline in rail passenger numbers and revenue, and the Treasury has demanded that train operators make huge cuts to costs to cover the shortfall. Although passenger numbers are recovering fast, the pressure to find short-term savings has been maintained, particularly while negotiations continue over pay and jobs. How would axing wifi cut costs for the government? Since the collapse of the rail franchising system, revenue and most costs are directly on the government’s balance sheet rather than the train operators – and the Treasury in particular is widely seen as wanting to reduce cost rather than invest to attract more custom. Network data is one cost, while a future switch to 5G will also be more costly than the simple upgrade from 3G to 4G using equipment already installed. Data contracts are not disclosed. Industry experts estimate the bill to be a maximum of £5m a year for the biggest companies but far smaller for most – and those contracts cover data that trains require for operating essentials, even if about 60% is used for passenger wifi. Those data contracts now go beyond the basics of staff communications and payment systems to the kind of maintenance regimes the industry hopes to introduce, from telematics on trains to video imaging of infrastructure and trackside vegetation. In that context, it is unclear how much money cutting passenger wifi services would actually save. The fear among passenger groups and train operators is that cutting passenger wifi will further dissuade people from using the railways just as their fares are needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-remains-epicentre-of-combat-ukraine-says-brazils-lula-upset-not-to-meet-zelenskiy-at-g7","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:56:34Z","webTitle":"Bakhmut at ‘epicentre’ of combat, Kyiv says; Putin aware of claim ‘saboteurs’ attempted to enter Belgorod – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-remains-epicentre-of-combat-ukraine-says-brazils-lula-upset-not-to-meet-zelenskiy-at-g7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-remains-epicentre-of-combat-ukraine-says-brazils-lula-upset-not-to-meet-zelenskiy-at-g7","fields":{"headline":"Bakhmut at ‘epicentre’ of combat, Kyiv says; Putin aware of claim ‘saboteurs’ attempted to enter Belgorod – as it happened","bodyText":"The blog has now wrapped for up today. Below is a round-up of today’s events. Anti-Kremlin militia claims to have overrun Russian border settlement in Belgorod. Fighting broke out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launching a cross-border raid, claiming to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. 12 northern European countries met to discuss stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. Defence ministers from the Northern Group met in Poland on Monday where talks described as “very good” by the Polish defence minister were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. The Labour leader also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets” and said “whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has tweeted out his nightly address where he claims Ukraine’s air defence systems have shot down “25 out of 25” Russian drones between Sunday night and Monday morning. The Associated Press reports that defence ministers and senior officials from 12 northern European countries met in Poland on Monday to talk about stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. They gathered near Warsaw as part of the Northern Group, a platform for developing security initiatives for Nato and European Union members. Members of the Northern Group include Britain, Germany, Poland and Finland. After the meeting, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said the “very good” talks were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. He underscored good cooperation with Britain and Sweden, saying the two countries have similar views on threats coming from Russia as it wages war on Ukraine. “We are looking for joint solutions to ensure security,” Błaszczak said. He said Poland’s efforts to obtain early warning planes from Sweden were moving forward. Officials also discussed preparations for the July Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Poland’s proposals for it, Błaszczak said. That summit is expected to gauge prospects for Ukraine’s membership. There have been eight injuries and no deaths as a result of the shelling in the Graivoronsky district in Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor for the region, has said during a live broadcast on the Russian social media network VKontakte. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod governor, has introduced emergency counter-terrorism mesasures, according to this message on Telegram: “In order to ensure the safety of citizens in the Belgorod region, the legal regime of the counter-terrorist operation has been introduced today, which establishes special measures and temporary restrictions. “Starting with the verification of documents proving their identity and ending with the suspension of the activities of hazardous industries and organisations that use explosive, radioactive, chemically and biologically hazardous substances.” Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. Starmer said: “As I told President Zelenskiy when I met him in Kyiv, whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” He also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets”. Starmer also urged the prime minister to proscribe the Wagner group as terrorists and “to ensure Britain’s sanctions are not just in place, but enforced”. Speaking beforehand, Sunak said: “When Putin launched his war he gambled that our resolve would falter, but he was wrong then and he is wrong now. “Russia’s military is failing on the battlefield; their economy is failing at home as we tighten the stranglehold on sanctions; and the image of the G7 leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with President Zelenskiy in Hiroshima sent a powerful message to the world: we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.” “Putin should know that we are not going anywhere.” The Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has accused the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, of personally ordering the illegal transfer of Ukrainian orphans and suggested he may be guilty of war crimes. Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, said “ample evidence” had been gathered indicating the “direct involvement” of Lukashenko and his regime in the deportation of Ukrainian children from territories occupied by Russia to Belarus. “Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the transfers of orphans to Belarus and facilitated their arrival by financial and organisational support,” states a report Tsikhanouskaya sent to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU foreign ministers. Tsikhanouskaya’s team estimates that at least 2,150 children will have been brought to Belarus by the end of this month. Some have been sent to the Dubrava camp in the Minsk region, which is said to be run by Belaruskali, a state-owned potash company and major source of revenue for the Lukashenko regime. The charge sheet against Lukashenko and Belaruskali comes amid growing pressure on the EU to tighten up sanctions against Belarus. The EU has already imposed sanctions on Belarus, including Belaruskali, both for its role in supporting the Russian invasion and the brutal crackdown on protesters after the 2020 elections. However, an extension of the sanctions has been held up for months over the question of whether Belaruskali should be granted an exemption in the name of food security. The European Commission had proposed an exemption for Belaruskali in a belief it would ease global food shortages. Lithuania, backed by Poland, Estonia and Hungary, is refusing to sign off sanctions if an exemption for Belaruskali is included. Vilnius argues that the market is adapting to provide alternatives to Belarusian potash. “It’s our duty not to fall into the trap of Russian propaganda. No lack of fertilisers [and] sanctions against Russia doesn’t cause food insecurity,” the Lithuanian foreign ministry tweeted on Monday. Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, has this roundup of what we know so far about the incident on Belgorod: Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. “We are the same Russians as you,” said a statement put out by the group on social media. “We are distinguished only by the fact that we no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals in power and took up arms to defend our and your freedom. But today it’s time for everyone to take responsibility for their future. It’s time to put an end to the Kremlin’s dictatorship.” Other video posted to social media showed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter trailing flares over the town of Kozinka and videos of smoke rising from the settlement with the sounds of emergency sirens clearly audible. The governor of the Belgorod region confirmed an attack on Monday, writing that “sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine have entered the territory of the Grayvoron district. The armed forces of the Russian Federation, together with the border service, Rosgvardiya and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Ukraine has disavowed connection to the Russian partisan fighters, saying that they act independently and are not subject to military control. The head of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has posted another update to Telegram about the outbreak of fighting inside Russia. He wrote: There are three more victims in Grayvoron – two men and one woman with shrapnel wounds, they are in the hospital in a state of moderate severity. All necessary medical assistance is provided. The shells also damaged three private residential buildings, as a result of which they caught fire. There is also a hit on the administration building. In the village of Zamostye, a shell hit a kindergarten, causing it to catch fire. There is also an injured woman with a hand wound, assistance was provided on the spot. Damage information is being updated. Here is what Russian state-owned media Tass is reporting as what it knows about events in Belgorod: The head of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov reported about the penetration of Ukrainian saboteurs into the Grayvoron district. He clarified that the Russian military, border guards, as well as employees of the National Guard and the FSB are taking “the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Prior to this, the governor reported two victims of shelling in the village of Glotovo, Graivoronsky district. According to him, a woman with mine-explosive wounds was taken to intensive care in a serious condition, the man’s condition is assessed as moderate. Later, the Kremlin confirmed that a Ukrainian sabotage group tried to break into the Belgorod region, now it is being squeezed out of Russian territory and destroyed. There are enough forces and means on the spot to fight saboteurs, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, told reporters. He clarified that Putin was informed about the incident. Peskov said that the purpose of the sabotage was “to divert attention from the Bakhmut direction, to minimize the political effect of the loss. Christopher Miller, covering the conflict for the FT, has suggested on Twitter that “Ukrainian incursions into poorly defended Russian settlements along the border could be part of the counteroffensive strategy to keep the Kremlin off balance.” The situation in Belgorod region remains unclear. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has published on its Telegram channel what it says is a message from the Freedom of Russia Legion. They claim to be participating in an attack inside the Russian Federation’s borders. Suspilne writes: “The situation is difficult” in the Belgorod region, the press service of the Freedom of Russia Legion informed us. They said that the Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps are creating a demilitarized zone on the border with the Russian Federation, from where the Russian army will not be able to fire at Ukraine. According to them, they will continue to “move towards the liberation of all of Russia.” The Kremlin has claimed that Ukraine is behind the incursion. Ukrainian officials have denied this. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. The report comes after the plant lost external power today for the seventh time during the conflict. The Post says that the plan being pushed by the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has five main points: According to two diplomats familiar with the negotiations, Grossi’s plan includes five principles: a ban on stationing heavy military equipment and military personnel at the plant; a ban on firing from and toward the plant, including a ban on attacking the personnel at the site; protection of all safety and security systems at the plant; protection of all external power lines; and monitoring of compliance of the above-mentioned principles. The Post notes that this appears to be less ambitious than Grossi’s previous proposal of a protection zone around the plant. The plant has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the war, and the Russian Federation has claimed to annex the Zaporizhzhia region, despite not fully controlling the territory. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has distanced Ukraine from events in Belgorod, where there are reports of an armed incursion into Russian territory. He wrote on Twitter: The only driving political force in a totalitarian country of tightened screws is always an armed guerrilla movement. Ukraine is watching the events in the Belgorod region of Russia with interest and studying the situation, but it has nothing to do with it. As you know, tanks are sold at any Russian military store, and underground guerrilla groups are composed of Russian citizens. The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of staging an incursion to distract from the Russian claim to have seized full control of Bakhmut at the weekend. Here are some pictures of the destruction caused overnight by what Ukraine claims were Russian strikes in Dnipro city in south-eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian army, Russian forces targeted the Dnipro with 16 missiles and 20 attack drones. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency has reported on its Telegram feed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has been informed about what is claimed to be an attempt to infiltrate the Belgorod region by Ukrainian forces. Citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, it posted: The ministry of defence, the FSB and the border service reported to Putin about an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to break into the Belgorod region, Peskov said. The purpose of the Ukrainian sabotage in the Belgorod region is to divert attention from the situation in the Bakhmut direction, he noted. Russian forces are working to squeeze out the Ukrainian saboteur group from the territory of the Russian Federation and destroy it. There are enough forces and means, the press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation added. Reuters reports that Ukraine’s military intelligence service has blamed an armed operation in Belgorod on Russian citizens belonging to two paramilitary groups, Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske said. It quoted military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov as saying the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps were responsible for the operation. Tass identified the territory of the Graivoronsky district as the location for the incident. None of the claims have been independently verified. Reuters reports that Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, claimed on Monday that a Ukrainian army “sabotage group” had entered Russian territory in the Graivoron district, which borders Ukraine. On Telegram, Gladkov claimed the Russian army and security forces were taking measures to fight off the incursion. “A sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine has entered the territory of the Graivoronsky district. The Russian armed forces, together with the border service, the Russian guard and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy. I will report the details,” he said. Reuters reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the private Russian army Wagner, repeated his vow to pull his troops out of Bakhmut in three days, and hand over the defence of the newly captured city to regular troops. “On the western edges, defensive positions have been set up, and so Wagner will be leaving Artyomovsk between 25 May and 1 June,” he said, using the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut. “If the Defence Ministry’s own forces aren’t enough, then we have thousands of generals – we just need to put together a battalion of generals, give them all guns, and it’ll all be fine.” Prigozhin has been a vocal critic of the army and defence establishment support that his Wagner mercenaries have received. Moscow’s defence ministry acknowledged that some Russian troops fell back outside Bakhmut last week, but has denied Prigozhin’s repeated assertion that the flanks were crumbling, or that the military had withheld ammunition from Wagner. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned enterprise for the nation’s nuclear power plants, has released a statement on the restoration of power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Ukrainian experts restored the operation of the Dniprovsk 750 kV high-voltage power transmission line, from which the temporarily occupied ZNPP supplies its own needs. The risk of a nuclear and radiation accident is minimised, the situation is stable. We will remind you that on the morning of 22 May, at 5.26am, this line was disconnected as a result of Russian shelling. Since it is the last one that powers the ZNPP, all backup diesel generators are automatically turned on. As a result, the station experienced a blackout for the seventh time since the beginning of the occupation. Earlier one of the Russian-installed leaders of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region claimed it had been Ukraine who had disconnected the power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister says his nation remains open to the idea of giving F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, but no firm position has been arrived at. Rasmussen said: “It doesn’t make sense to train someone to fly a plane if you’ve decided in advance that they can never, ever be allowed to fly the plane. On the other hand, you cannot conclude from this that we have made a decision to donate aircraft.” This follows on from comments earlier this morning where Rasmussen said his nation would like to host a summit in July about finding peace between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence appeared to gave a pictorial response to the proposed peace summit, tweeting a picture of a fighter jet superimposed over a peace symbol, with the caption “Ukraine’s Peace Formula” • This post was amended on 22 May 2023. An earlier version mistakenly identified Rasmussen as the Dutch foreign minister. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Citing Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, Suspilne is reporting that two women have been hospitalised after shelling on Kupiansk. It reports “private houses and civil infrastructure were damaged in the city”. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that the external power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been restored, after an earlier outage forced the plant to rely on emergency diesel generators. It posted to Telegram: Energy workers have restored the power transmission line that feeds the ZNPP. The station is switching to power from the Ukrainian energy system, Ukrenergo reported. Finland’s state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said on Monday it had terminated a contract to buy natural gas from Gazprom Export via pipelines from Russia. Reuters reports Gazprom ceased pipeline-based natural gas deliveries to Gasum in May 2022 in a dispute over payments, and the two sides had been in talks to resolve the matter. Gazprom demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which Finland refused to do. Reuters reports Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has said his nation would like to host a summit in July about how to find peace between Ukraine and Russia, citing the Ritzau news agency. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in Novaya Tavolzhanka. Vyacheslav Gladkov posted: In Novaya Tavolzhanka, an explosive device was dropped from a drone next to a private residential building. There were no casualties or damage. The UAV itself fell 100 metres from residential buildings. Explosives and operational services are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city of Bakhmut, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. Reuters reports she said, in televised comments, that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there. In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Russian sources refer to Bakhmut by its Soviet-era name Artemovsk. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels for the Guardian: The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Meeting in Hiroshima over the weekend, leaders of the west’s seven largest economies, plus the heads of the European Commission and Council, pledged to “starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine”. Significantly, they also promised to reduce reliance on civil nuclear goods from Russia and to restrict the trade in diamonds mined, processed or produced in Russia. Nuclear power and diamonds have increasingly been seen as no-go areas for EU sanctions, because of objections from Hungary and Belgium respectively. Hungary, which has signed a contract with Rosatom to build nuclear reactors, has repeatedly threatened to veto any nuclear sanctions, while Belgium, home to one of the world’s largest diamond trading hubs, has used more subtle diplomacy to get the precious stones off EU sanctions lists. The Belgian government argues that an international agreement to stop Russian stones being traded elsewhere in the world is necessary, rather than unilateral EU action. Borrell did not mention any specific sector in his comments. The promise to implement the G7 text comes as EU27 member states continue to spar over the current sanctions proposals, largely aimed at clamping down on companies and countries that help Moscow dodge western measures. Sweden’s foreign minister, Tobias Billström, said talks were well under way and he was confident of an eventual agreement, despite Hungary’s threats to block the latest proposals. Earlier we reported remarks published on the Russian embassy in Washington’s Telegram channel by ambassador Anatoly Antonov, in which he appeared to draw a separate line between attacks on Crimea and attacks on the four regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claimed to annex last year. He said: I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, appears to have retorted to that this morning in a tweet, saying: Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop “Russian aggressions” and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today … The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. In a message on Telegram, Alexander Bogomaz said: The armed forces of Ukraine fired mortars at the village of Khoromnoe in the Klimovsky district. There were no casualties. As a result of the shelling, one household and an outbuilding caught fire. Operational and emergency services are on site. Bryansk region is to the north of Ukraine, and shares its borders with Ukraine and Belarus. The claims have not been independently verified. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. In a tweet, he wrote: Ukraine’s ZNPP this morning lost all external electricity for seventh time during conflict, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators for power; nuclear safety situation at the plant extremely vulnerable. We must agree to protect plant now; this situation cannot continue. The Kyiv Post is carrying a video clip which it claims shows damage to one of the fire stations in Dnipro which appears to have been targeted in an overnight attack. Oliver Carroll, foreign correspondent at the Economist, has tweeted one of the images released from the scene, observing “Russia may have targeted emergency services in missile attacks on Dnipro last night. Local authorities reporting massive damage in one of the stations - more than 20 vehicles destroyed.” Other images released by officials in Ukraine show several views of the damage. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure since it began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The former commander of joint forces command Richard Barrons has been on Sky News in the UK, and he was asked what difference sending F-16 planes could make to Ukraine’s war effort. He told viewers: It is a very complex fourth generation aircraft will give Ukraine a decisive advantage over the Russian air force and indeed, over Russian ground forces if they get to the right threshold of capability, and have the family of ammunition that make the aircraft so effective. It would turn the battle in the skies in favour of Ukraine when Ukraine has enough of aircraft, enough competence with it and enough of the family of missiles that make it effective. There’s not much wrong with [the Ukrainian air force], it is certainly full of spirit. But it’s aircraft are mostly Russian aircraft, and therefore well known to the Russians. So they’ve not been able to throw the Russian air force out of the skies, and they’ve relied very heavily on their ground air defences. F-16s will give them the ability to take Ukraine air power over Russian forces in Ukraine. That will be a gamechanger. However, Barrons stressed it was not a short-term project. We should recognise that F-16s will take about 18 months to become combat effective in Ukraine. So what this signals is an expectation on the part of the G7 and others and President Zelenskiy that whatever the outcome of the offensive they’re about to mount, this war will go on into next year. Here is an update on the situation overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Ukraine says at least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one man was wounded in the attack on Dnipro city and seven people were injured on an attack on Synelnykivskyi district of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Reuters reports the governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com A picture is worth a thousand words and the images from the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend were a good example of that. Volodymyr Zelenskiy was pictured at the centre of a “family portrait” with G7 leaders at the weekend, symbolising their support for the Ukrainian president. Just less than 10 years ago the G7 was the G8 – when Russia was a member of the group and president Vladimir Putin attended summits. Moscow was kicked out in 2014 after the invasion of Crimea. Other pictures showed Zelenskiy being hugged by French president Emmanuel Macron, US president Joe Biden with his arm around him, and sharing smiles and handshakes with other leaders including Canada’s Justin Trudeau and the UK’s Rishi Sunak. More on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with Ukraine’s state-owned power generating company Energoatom confirming that it has experienced a power outage. “Yes, we have the seventh blackout since the start of the [Russian] occupation,” Energoatom told Reuters. Yuriy Malashko, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, said there was a fire at one of the facilities in Zaporizhzhia city due to an overload in the power system. “Problems with electricity supply that arose in the city of Zaporizhzhia are not related to shelling,” Malashko said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: So far Washington is opposing us … by proxy. However, every specialist knows that there is no infrastructure for the use of F-16s in Ukraine, and the required number of pilots and maintenance personnel is not there either. What would happen if American fighters take off from Nato airfields, operated by foreign ‘volunteers’? I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kiev regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Volodymyr Zelenskiy stole the show at the G7 summit, Patrick Wintour writes in his analysis of the weekend, with Zelenskiy’s whirlwind round of diplomacy the culmination of a Ukrainian realisation that for months they have been talking to wrong people. Yes, it is essential to keep lines constantly open to Ukraine’s invested allies in the west, reaping the rewards such as Joe Biden’s decision finally to lift his veto on Ukrainian pilots training to fly US-made F-16 fighter aircraft, but the identification of the west with Ukraine’s cause is almost complete. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks by saying “Slava Ukrajni – Glory to Europe”. But Ukraine for months has known it is not telling its story clearly enough to the phalanx of 40 or so nonaligned states that have abstained at successive UN general assembly votes on the war. India, Brazil, China and as many as 20 African states have sat on the sidelines in the key votes. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been switched to standby and emergency power supply generators, a Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region says.. Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. “(The power) partially disappeared in Zaporizhzhia due to an emergency situation at one of the energy facilities,” Kurtev said on the Telegram messaging app. Explosions were heard in the city of Dnipro overnight as well as in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, with a nationwide air raid alert activated at 3.48am, according to the Kyiv Independent. The city of Odesa was also reportedly hit by Russian combat drones late on Sunday. In a Telegram post, the governor of Dnipro, Serhiy Lysak, said: “Thanks to the defence forces, we withstood the attack.” He later said 15 drones and four cruise missiles had been shot down over the region, while eight people had been injured, including three taken to hospital. Dozens of vehicles were destroyed or damaged as well as nine apartment buildings, several private homes, shops, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, he said. Ukraine’s armed forces have sent a series of photos from Bakhmut, which show some of the extent of the city’s destruction. At the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “I’ll tell you openly: photographs of ruined Hiroshima absolutely remind me of Bakhmut and other similar settlements. Nothing left alive, all the buildings ruined.” Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Confusion has reigned as Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out air strikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Here’s our full report on the back-and-forth by Peter Beaumont and Julian Borger: Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said he is “upset” that he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. AFP reports: Zelenskiy, who emerged from the summit in Hiroshima with fresh diplomatic support and pledges of more military aid, had sought a one-on-one meeting with Lula, who has faced accusations of being soft on Russia over its invasion. Both leaders said scheduling conflicts had prevented them from meeting – which Zelenskiy quipped had likely left his Brazilian counterpart “disappointed”. “I wasn’t disappointed. I was upset, because I’d like to meet him and discuss the matter,” Lula told a news conference before heading home from Japan. But “Zelenskiy is a grown-up. He knows what he’s doing,” he added. Lula said his team had scheduled a meeting with Zelenskiy for Sunday afternoon. But the Ukrainian leader ran late, and his own agenda was full after that, he said. Lula said he did not see a point in meeting Zelenskiy now, saying neither he nor Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to want peace. “For now, they’re both convinced they’re going to win the war,” he said. Lula is pushing for peace talks and has proposed Brazil as a mediator, along with other “neutral” countries, including China and Indonesia. But the veteran leftist faced criticism last month when he accused the United States of “encouraging” the war. After the White House accused him of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda”, Lula toned down his rhetoric, saying Brazil condemned Russia’s invasion. But he renewed his criticism Monday. US president Joe Biden, he said, is sending the message that “Putin has to surrender and pay for everything he wrecked”. “That message isn’t helping,” he said. Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk city of Marinka remain the “epicentre” of the conflict, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, a day after Russia claimed it had completed its “liberation” of the ruined city. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russia had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” Here are other recent developments: Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the G7 summit in Japan as a “politicised” event which it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said the G7 had “irreversibly deteriorated” and that the forum had become “an ‘incubator’ where, under the leadership of the Anglo-Saxons, destructive initiatives that undermine global stability are prepared”. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April. The head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev will hold talks on Monday with Chen Wenqing, member of the Chinese Communist party’s politburo who oversees police, legal affairs and intelligence, the Russian RIA state news reported. Patrushev, a former chief of the FSB internal security service, is widely seen as one of the most hawkish members of Putin’s inner circle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-suella-braverman-masking-failure-with-bombast","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:47:30Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Suella Braverman: masking failure with bombast | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-suella-braverman-masking-failure-with-bombast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-suella-braverman-masking-failure-with-bombast","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Suella Braverman: masking failure with bombast","bodyText":"Whether the home secretary, Suella Braverman, keeps her job is up to the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. That is in keeping with his prerogative powers to organise the composition of the government as he sees fit. But what happens when ministers hardly hide their disagreements or make a habit of defying the norms of behaviour expected of office-holders? That is the place where Ms Braverman seems to be heading – and she’s been there before. Last October, Ms Braverman was forced to resign as home secretary after confessing to a “technical” breach of the ministerial code. Her departure had been a long time coming. Ms Braverman had publicly contradicted her government’s more liberal stance on immigration. She left office a day before the Truss administration fell. Mr Sunak reappointed Ms Braverman to the Home Office less than a week later. Last December, MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee warned that this dishonourable affair set a “dangerous” precedent: “To allow this to take place does not inspire confidence in the integrity of government, nor offer much incentive to proper conduct in future”. Those words seem prescient given what is happening now, on Mr Sunak’s watch. This week it emerged that last year, when she was attorney general, Ms Braverman was caught speeding and asked civil servants to help organise a one-to-one driving awareness course so she would not have to appear in a group. They rightly refused, arguing that this was a personal, not a policy, matter. Her request raises the issue of her judgment. But the way this matter is now handled threatens to become one of Mr Sunak’s judgment. The prime minister will have to decide whether Ms Braverman came clean about what happened at the time – and subsequently. Did she tell Mr Sunak about the incident before she was reappointed home secretary? Why did her special adviser deny the story when asked about it by the Daily Mirror earlier this year? If the prime minister feels Ms Braverman has questions to answer then he should have an inquiry into the affair. This would provide cover for Mr Sunak – who will continue to face questions over the episode – and if nothing too serious emerges, he could deliver a slap on Ms Braverman’s wrist. But her fate is tied more to the current fractious politics of the Conservative party than to her conduct with the civil service. Her department is responsible for net migration, so her call to “get overall immigration numbers down” seems connected to her political ambitions. Ms Braverman’s speech to the National Conservatism conference last week looked like an audition to be party leader. The home secretary’s rhetoric is an attempt to divert attention from her failure to meet the government’s 2019 pledge to bring down net migration. Profound disagreements on post-Brexit immigration policy have split the Tories. These will be illuminated this week when, on her watch, net migration figures are expected to hit a record high. Cabinet colleagues rightfully see careerism in Ms Braverman’s “authority of the people” bombast. However, her insouciance about the rules ought to make Mr Sunak think twice about a quick reprieve. Ms Braverman prefers politics to be guided by atavistic fears rather than economic self-interest. This lends itself to a competition where those who lie best win. Mr Sunak must surely want better for his party and this country. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After a remarkable victory, this piece of political hyperbole seemed almost justified. Prior to the weekend, no ruling party had increased its vote share in Greece for more than 40 years. It had been predicted that a state wiretapping scandal, and the background to a catastrophic rail accident in February, could damage Mr Mitsotakis’s prospects. Yet polls predicting a relatively close race proved wildly out, as the centre-right New Democracy party gained more than double the votes of its leftwing rival, Syriza. Having fractionally failed to win an absolute majority, Mr Mitsotakis may now trigger a second election – to be held under a different proportional system – which would be likely to hand him a handsome mandate. Mr Mitsotakis won big partly because of signs of economic progress, and partly because voters scarred by the eurozone debt crisis sought stability and continuity. The government was able to point to a variety of reassuring indicators. Foreign direct investment rose last year by 50%. The Greek economy, albeit from a very low base, is currently growing at twice the eurozone average. After three bailouts totalling €280bn, international supervision of spending controls by lenders was finally ended last summer. Mr Mitsotakis’s small state, tax-cutting platform was also combined with ruthlessly populist policies on migration, including a Trumpian pledge to extend a steel border fence along almost the entire length of Greece’s border with Turkey. Viewed from the left, however, this was as much an election lost as an election won. It may come to be seen as the grim finale to a political cycle that began in 2015, when Syriza’s leader, Aléxis Tsípras, won a mandate to resist crushing austerity measures demanded by Brussels, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The circumstances of Mr Tsípras’s subsequent U-turn – under extreme political duress as Greece teetered on the brink of leaving the euro – has subsequently fractured the left and undermined its credibility. Having enacted sweeping austerity measures between 2015 and 2019, Mr Tsípras campaigned this time round on calls for greater welfare spending and public investment. It didn’t wash. A high abstention rate, and Syriza’s plummeting share of the vote, pointed to a loss of faith in Greece’s main progressive party and its leader. The re-emergence of Pasok, the centre-left party eclipsed by Syriza at the time of the eurozone crisis, may point to a future realignment. Mr Tsípras’s political future looks uncertain after what amounted to a humiliation. For the sake of millions of households living close to the edge, Greece’s opposition parties need to quickly regroup and find common ground. Mr Mitsotakis’s market-friendly reforms may have delighted banks and investors, and reassured the comfortable middle classes. But the less well-off continue to suffer the dire consequences of punitive and sustained austerity. The Greek economy remains about a fifth smaller than it was before 2008. Levels of poverty and social exclusion are among the highest in Europe. Financial stability and the paying down of debt to international creditors has been achieved at the expense of general living standards. Mr Mitsotakis will deliver more of the same and the markets will cheer him for it. After a dismal night, progressive forces need to find a way back into the conversation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/automated-uk-welfare-system-needs-more-human-contact-ministers-warned","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:42:06Z","webTitle":"Automated UK welfare system needs more human contact, ministers warned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/automated-uk-welfare-system-needs-more-human-contact-ministers-warned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/automated-uk-welfare-system-needs-more-human-contact-ministers-warned","fields":{"headline":"Automated UK welfare system needs more human contact, ministers warned","bodyText":"More human contact is needed in the UK’s automated welfare system, ministers have been warned, as it emerged 350 low-paid workers every day are raising complaints about errors in welfare top-ups, causing financial hardship and emotional stress. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) handled 126,286 disputes about errors made by its decade-old automated “real-time information” (RTI) system in 2022, a freedom of information request revealed. The technology is a key cog in the administration of universal credit (UC) – the UK’s main welfare system – and delivers a flow of earnings data from tax to benefit offices to automatically adjust workers’ welfare top-ups. When it goes wrong, claimants have described it as “hellish” and “horrible”. Others say the “digital by default” approach is an improvement on an earlier, less responsive system. The problems particularly affect single mothers working part-time, according to researchers at the University of Edinburgh, who obtained the complaints data using transparency laws. The DWP has been criticised for its lack of openness about the way its automated and artificial intelligence systems work and how they affect claimants. Emily, an administrator, said she was docked £300 when her employer filed the wrong monthly salary amount. She said she could not sleep as it plunged her into a financial crisis. The error was not fixed for two months. “The whole system is … an absolute shambles,” Emily said. “They are causing more hardship.” Jennifer, a single mother of two who works in a school canteen, had her benefits delayed because the system could not adapt to her being paid every four weeks, rather than monthly. In one message she wrote to the UC system, she said: “Is there a crisis place that can help me with school uniform or school dinners? My cooker’s broken. I have £76 in my account to do me – all bills, shopping … I don’t understand why I am worse off on universal credit. It’s horrible. Never been this skint in my life.” If each complaint came from a single claimant it would mean one in 18 working welfare claimants have raised complaints in the last year. More will have been affected without raising it formally. The researchers, Morgan Currie and Lena Podoletz, described this as a “high level of error” with a “huge human impact”. “Among the people we interviewed, it regularly took over two months for their disputes to be settled,” they said. “For a middle-class household, with some savings to tide them over until the dispute is resolved, this would not be a major problem. But for the people on universal credit, who are living on the breadline, this can lead to extreme hardship.” The complaints come amid increasing use of automation and artificial intelligence to deliver welfare in Britain. Five years ago, the United Nations rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, warned of the “disappearance of the postwar British welfare state behind a webpage and an algorithm”. “In its place, a digital welfare state is emerging,” he said. “The impact on the human rights of the most vulnerable in the UK will be immense.” The researchers are calling for more human contact in the system plus “a public register that describes any systems or algorithms that are used in the delivery of UC to make this process transparent”. The RTI system is not believed to use artificial intelligence, but last year the DWP said it had been trialling “a machine learning algorithm” to detect fraud in claims for UC advances. It makes predictions based on historical fraud and error data “without being explicitly programmed by a human being”. The National Audit Office has said the government “is aware of the potential for such a model to generate biased outcomes that could have an adverse impact on certain claimants”. Errors would be inevitable, it said, and “if the model were to disproportionately identify a group with a protected characteristic as more likely to commit fraud, the model could inadvertently obstruct fair access to benefits”. The DWP has so far declined to release further information about how it works, or any results of the trial including any unfair bias that may have been found. It has cited the need to protect the system against crime – most likely fraud by individuals or organised crime. A DWP spokesperson said: “Customers have a direct line of contact through our dedicated work coaches who are on hand to provide tailored, one-to-one support in person at the jobcentre. In addition, we fund support for universal credit applications through the help-to-claim service provided by Citizens Advice. “The majority of customers are satisfied with the service they receive and in the very small proportion of cases where errors do occur, we are committed to fixing them as quickly as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/22/whatsapp-allow-users-to-edit-messages-15-minutes","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:38:32Z","webTitle":"WhatsApp to allow users to edit messages … but only for 15 minutes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/whatsapp-allow-users-to-edit-messages-15-minutes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/22/whatsapp-allow-users-to-edit-messages-15-minutes","fields":{"headline":"WhatsApp to allow users to edit messages … but only for 15 minutes","bodyText":"WhatsApp has announced an editing feature to allow users to alter messages up to 15 minutes after they have been sent. The Meta-owned messaging service has started rolling out the editing function globally and it should become available to all users in the coming weeks, the platform said in a blogpost. Messages that have been edited will have an “edited” notification displayed alongside them, although the edit history will not be shown so a user cannot view what the post said before it was altered. The feature can be activated by pressing down on a message and selecting “edit” from the pop-up menu that appears. Previously, the only way to correct a message sent in haste or containing an error was to delete it and send a fresh one, with recipients alerted to the fact by the removed post being replaced with the phrase: “This message was deleted.” “From correcting a simple misspelling to adding extra context to a message, we’re excited to bring you more control over your chats. All you need to do is long-press on a sent message and choose ‘Edit’ from the menu for up to 15 minutes after,” said WhatsApp. Competing apps such as Telegram and Signal already allow users to edit messages, while Twitter rolled out the ability to edit tweets to select users last year. Twitter offers an editing feature to subscribers to its Twitter Blue service, giving them a 30-minute window to edit a tweet after it has been sent. Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, flagged the WhatsApp change on his Facebook page, showing a message that had been changed from “Beast of luck!” to “Best of luck!” Facebook, also owned by Meta, started to roll out the ability to edit posts and comments about a decade ago. Its fellow Meta social media platform Instagram allows users to edit posts but not comments. Meta is embroiled in a dispute with the UK government about its best-known feature: end-to-end encryption, which ensures only the receiver and sender can view messages. Last month, WhatsApp and Signal signed an open letter warning the online safety bill could undermine the UK’s privacy and safety, saying the legislation “provides no explicit protection for encryption” because it could empower the communications regulator to demand tech firms weaken encryption systems in order to tackle terrorism or child sexual abuse content."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/work-related-suicides-should-investigated-watchdog-unions-say","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:33:13Z","webTitle":"Work-related suicides should be investigated by watchdog, unions say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/work-related-suicides-should-investigated-watchdog-unions-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/work-related-suicides-should-investigated-watchdog-unions-say","fields":{"headline":"Work-related suicides should be investigated by watchdog, unions say","bodyText":"Work-related suicides should be reported by employers and investigated by the safety watchdog amid concern that workplace stress is at “epidemic levels”, trade unions have said. They fear the death of the primary school headteacher Ruth Perry, who killed herself while awaiting the outcome of an Ofsted report, shows that potentially fatal work-related stress is not confined to teaching. The Trades Union Congress (TUC), Unison, the Public and Commercial Services Union and teaching unions are all backing a change in the law to allow the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to investigate work-related suicides. Under HSE rules, employers have a duty to report all deaths of their workers, with an exception for suicides – unlike other countries. In the UK the HSE cannot investigate any work-related suicide unless it receives a referral by a coroner. Perry’s death prompted experts to call for a change in the law to allow it to launch an immediate inquiry into work-related stress in the education sector. An article in the British Medical Journal by Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, and Prof Sarah Waters from the University of Leeds said there had been reports of at least eight other teacher suicides linked to Ofsted reports. But it said the true extent of the problem could not be known without an inquiry. Trade unions have backed the call for a change in the law but say it should be broadened to include a duty on all employers to report work-related suicides. The TUC’s Shelly Asquith, who leads on health and safety issues, said: “It is vital that work-related suicides are reported and investigated by the HSE. “The tragic case of Ruth Perry is not an isolated one. Ofsted has been cited several times by inquests into educators’ deaths. Work-related stress is at epidemic levels. We cannot turn a blind eye to it. “The HSE must be given the funding it needs to improve safety and wellbeing at work. That means reversing the swingeing cuts of the last decade.” Unison and the PCS union are also backing the call. Jon Richards, an assistant general secretary at Unison, said: “Stress, bullying and harassment at work take a massive toll on the mental health of staff. The HSE should take account of the full impact of work on employees. That includes where workers tragically take their own lives.” Prof Phil Banfield, the chair of the British Medical Association, backed the call and said there was a “serious mental health crisis amongst healthcare professionals driven by huge levels of demand, the largest ever backlog of care and serious staffing shortages”. He added: “The HSE must have the necessary resources and correct processes in place to ensure that they can effectively investigate and evaluate this in a way that can result in much-needed change within the healthcare system to ultimately help reduce the prevalence of work-related suicides.” The National Association of Head Teachers praised the BMJ article as a “powerful intervention”. And in a tweet the National Education Union also welcomed it for “highlighting the urgency of the mental health crisis @Ofstednews is fuelling”. McKee said: “Every suicide is a tragedy for the family and friends of the individual who loses their life. And if there are circumstances that could be tackled to prevent that happening we have a responsibility to do something about them.” Jim McManus, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, stopped short of backing a change in the law, saying suicides were currently investigated by coroners. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

He had just seen Real Madrid lose 1-0 against Valencia but, standing in the cramped, narrow tunnel that leads to the Mestalla dressing room where he said his best player sat “angry and sad”, he didn’t care about that and couldn’t comprehend anyone else caring either. So when the standard post‑match interview began with the standard post‑match question, an enquiry as to his thoughts on another defeat, he decided that, actually, no, this wasn’t going to be standard any more. Instead, he shot back: “You want to talk about football?! Or shall we talk about the other thing? That’s more important than a loss, don’t you think?” Maybe this time, at last, some will begin to think so. If the Madrid manager didn’t feel much like talking about football, it was because Vinícius Júnior, the kid in his care, the 22-year-old winger who is probably the most electric, most exciting player in the Spanish league, a genuine superstar for a new generation, didn’t feel much like playing it any more. Why would he, why should he, when as he arrived at Mestalla a group of fans gathered outside had chanted: “Vinícius, you’re a monkey”? When from the south stand he had been told the same? When he had been told that he was an idiot, an imbecile. When he had heard the “oooh, ooohs”? He had had enough. There was a moment in the second half when cameras closed in on Vinícius’s face, tears welling in his eyes. In its simplicity, its sadness, that may be the most powerful of many dreadful images from Sunday night, but the one that made the greatest impact, the one that started something, which gathered the kind of momentum that could yet mean something tangible, came when he literally made a stand, facing down the men who abused him. There were 20 minutes left when he pointed at a Valencia fan behind the goal, saying: “You, you, yes, you”, telling teammates that man there had called him “a monkey”; “he did this”, Vinícius said, imitating an ape gesture, hands tucked under his armpits. Alongside him, Lucas Vázquez confronted fans: “Shitty racists.” The referee arrived on the pitch and police arrived in the stands. Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea spoke to Vinícius, explaining the protocol and asking him to trust him: first an announcement is made over the loudspeaker, and then, he told Vinícius, “if it happens a second time, we leave”. Thibaut Courtois told him it had happened in the first half too and Vinícius was ready to go already. The PA announcement, warning the game could be suspended, was met with whistles. Ancelotti, who has been through this before with Kalidou Koulibaly in Italy, spoke to the official and his player. “He didn’t want to continue,” he said, “but I told him it didn’t seem fair that he is the one that has to stop playing because it is not his fault: I told him you’re not the guilty party; you’re the victim.” There was something in that message reminiscent of the awful sight of Mouctar Diakhaby, the victim of racist abuse sitting in the stands watching his alleged abuser play on two years ago. Ancelotti embraced Vinícius, then kissed him, supporting him in going on. Maybe they could have walked, maybe next time they will – “had he wanted to we would have gone with him,” Courtois said – but this time he continued. Until the last minute of a game that overran by more than 10 minutes – when he was sent off for thrusting an arm into the face of Hugo Duro who, in the middle of a melee, had him round the neck. As he went, he gestured to the Valencia fans that they were going down. “The card made no sense,” Ancelotti said afterwards; even if strictly speaking it was deserved, it served to deepen a sense that somehow everything was upside down. As for the gesture, that was natural given everything he had been subjected to, Ancelotti said. Not just here, but in those other grounds too. On social media Vinícius made the point this was “not the first time, and not the second or the third either” – there have been nine formal complaints made about abuse he has suffered this season – and described racism as “normal”, encouraged even. He adopted the league’s slogan to insist that this “is not football, it’s La Liga”. Nothing, he said, gets done, nothing happens. The competition that “once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Messi and Cristiano, now belongs to the racists”, he said; Brazilians see Spain as a racist country that had left him defenceless. A subsequent post from his representatives likened him to George Floyd. “If a stadium insults a player racially, the game has to stop – and I would say the same if we were winning 3-0,” Ancelotti said. “Stop the game, there is no other way. The referee says that the fans have to be informed first and if it continues, then we stop the game. But, for me, he doesn’t need to inform them. I am curious to see what happens now.” The last line was pointed, so he was asked what he thought would happen. “Nothing,” he said. “Because it has happened lots of times and nothing happens.” That suspicion was only deepened when Javier Tebas, the president of the league, went on Twitter and accused Vinícius of failing to understand whose responsibility it is to deal with racism and not showing up when they arranged meetings to explain the process to him, accusing him of insulting the country and the competition and suggesting he had allowed himself to be “manipulated”. There may have been a point in there somewhere: the league and the clubs are acting with greater determination, with observers at every game. The nine complaints of abuse directed at Vinícius were investigated and brought by the league and handed to the authorities, while protocols and punishments do not depend solely on them. When the league filed a complaint about the racist abuse sung before the Madrid derby in September, it was state prosecutors that failed to proceed. The Espanyol fans they denounced to the authorities for abusing Iñaki Williams are due in court. And yet immediately after the abuse on Sunday, the tweet was alarmingly tone deaf and the feeling that nothing is done naturally hangs heavy; there is something depressingly inevitable about it all and no escaping that the only time a game has been abandoned in Spain was when Rayo Vallecano fans accused striker Roman Zozulya of being a “Nazi”. “Once again, instead of criticising racists, the president of the league appears on social media to attack me,” Vinícius replied. “Much as you talk and pretend not to read, the image of your league is damaged. Look at the responses to your posts and you’ll be surprised. By omission, you place yourself on the same level as racists. I want action and punishments; hashtags don’t move me.” He, though, was moving something. No one else: him. By confronting his abusers and those he sees as their enablers – by making the stand himself – by speaking out, by refusing to back down, by fighting, something started. And although Ancelotti was challenged on his initial claim that the whole stadium had racially abused Vinícius – “this is not one person going mad, it is a ground” – when the chants he referred to had called the Brazilian tonto [stupid] not mono [monkey], there could be little doubt about the coach’s insistence “the league has a problem”. That realisation may end in nothing tangible and there is impotence in lamenting another episode just to watch it happen again. There are still too many of those that chose sides by team, although they are fewer now, at least publicly. There are still those that insist on the buts, even as Ancelotti insisted “there are no ‘buts’”, those that accuse Vinícius of being provocative, as if somehow that makes it OK. He is the only one who gets the abuse, some say, as if that does too, as if that even means anything, as if that limits the impact to him alone when it is the opposite. Others talk about this as just a way of putting off a brilliant player, as if that was a legitimate weapon. But the hope, which may be hopelessly optimistic, is that it is inescapable now: they were being confronted with it. There were messages of condemnation for the competition and support for Vinícius, a media taking this on more before, a sense that it does matter, protocols and assumptions challenged. It came not just from Spain but everywhere, a mirror held up, accusations obliging action. There were statements from the Brazilian football federation and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from other clubs and players, including Valencia’s Diakhaby. Another investigation was announced. Valencia vowed to ban the fans identified for life. The Brazilian foreign minister called the Spanish ambassador. The fight is taken to them, demands made, threats hanging over them. Above all, by him. “He’s sad and he’s angry, but sad most of all,” said Ancelotti, but he isn’t stopping. “I will go up against the racists until the very end,” Vinícius Júnior said, “even if it’s far from here.” And if players such as him go, who is going to want to talk about the football then?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2023/may/22/talking-horses-dettori-gets-up-to-speed-on-arrest-before-derby-farewell","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:19:56Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Jockey Club applies for Derby injunction to block Animal Rising ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/22/talking-horses-dettori-gets-up-to-speed-on-arrest-before-derby-farewell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/may/22/talking-horses-dettori-gets-up-to-speed-on-arrest-before-derby-farewell","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Jockey Club applies for Derby injunction to block Animal Rising ","bodyText":"The Jockey Club, which operates Epsom racecourse, has applied for an injunction to prevent the protest group Animal Rising engaging in “acts intended to disrupt the Derby Festival” when the track stages both the Oaks and the Derby on 2 and 3 June. Activists from Animal Rising attempted to prevent the Grand National at Aintree going ahead last month, and the start of the race was delayed by 15 minutes. More than 100 activists were arrested before and after the race took place. Up to 100,000 spectators are expected at Epsom next month, including tens of thousands who will watch for free from the “Hill” enclosure in the middle of the track. The Jockey Club said on Monday that it had been forced to go to court because Animal Rising has made it “explicitly clear” that it intends to stage a “disruptive” protest at the course. The injunction would “prohibit individuals from entering onto the racetrack and carrying out other acts with the intention and/or effect of disrupting the races”. If the injunction is granted at a high court hearing on Friday, individuals acting in breach “could be subject to proceedings for contempt of court, which may lead to a fine and/or imprisonment”. Nevin Truesdale, the Jockey Club’s chief executive, said on Monday: “We respect everyone’s right to peaceful and lawful protest and with that in mind, have offered Animal Rising a space for this purpose directly outside the racecourse during the Derby Festival. However, Animal Rising have made it explicitly clear that they intend to breach security and access the track itself in an attempt to stop racing taking place and it is our duty and obligation to do everything we can to protect everyone’s safety” Nathan McGovern, a spokesperson for Animal Rising, said on Monday that the group would not be deterred by the threat of legal action. “It’s not entirely unexpected,” McGovern said. “Injunctions are a very dark side of British legislation which allow companies to buy their own laws. We will not be deterred. The existence of an injunction would raise the risks for people taking action, but the issues we are talking about are far too important to let slide.” Dettori gets up to speed on Arrest before Derby farewell “It’s a lot of lasts,” Frankie Dettori said at Epsom on Monday morning, shortly after giving Arrest, his final Derby ride, a spin around Tattenham Corner before the Classic on Saturday week. “I went to Rome yesterday for my last Derby there. I saw the vice-prime minister and he gave me a plaque to congratulate me on my career, now it’s my last Derby and with a live chance, so good.” Dettori will be hoping for rather more than a plaque when he climbs aboard Arrest at around 1.15pm on 3 June, as the Chester Vase winner is one of nearly a dozen horses currently on offer at 20-1 or shorter for what promises to be one of the most open Derbys of recent years. And since the jockey had expressed some doubt after Arrest’s win at Chester regarding his ability to act on the track, particularly in the event of quick ground, it was reassuring to see him slide around Tattenham Corner without a second thought. The real test, of course, will come when he needs to do it again at racing pace, but Arrest was sufficiently well-balanced to draw six-and-a-half lengths clear of the runner-up on the Roodee and also goes to Epsom as one of the few Classic contenders with a win in the book at the full mile-and-a-half Classic trip. “The most crucial part is Tattenham Corner, where horses can really win or lose the race, and he went around there fine,” Dettori said. “In the straight, it took him a furlong to get organised, but he’s a big horse. Then he went very straight, and I was very happy with him. He’s growing up and getting stronger and Chester has done him the world of good. It [fast ground] is an issue, but Andrew [Cooper, the clerk of the course] always does a great job. I’ve not ridden in a very fast [ground] Derby for a long time, it’s always been good or good-to-soft, so fingers crossed, may the rain continue.” Dettori’s mount in the Derby Italiano set off as 2.1-1 favourite (and finished only fourth), and he is likely to be aboard even more market leaders than usual over the next few months, as he takes his final rides in a long series of major races. Arrest could easily be another if the punters get behind Dettori on Saturday week, although John Gosden’s colt is currently only the third-choice in the ante-post betting at 13-2, behind Military Order (7-2) and Auguste Rodin (9-2). Passenger, third home in the Dante Stakes at York last week after a troubled run, is a 7-1 chance, while The Foxes, the Dante winner, is 10-1 and it is 12-1 bar. “It looks a wide-open Derby,” Dettori said. “I haven’t seen any horses really dominate in any trials, they all won but no one won by five lengths, so it looks really open and competitive. Every week, they improve, and at this stage we’ve still got two weeks to go and I suspect after this gallop he’ll go on a bit. We always thought a bit of him last year, but he was all frame and no muscle. Sometimes horses from two to three don’t develop, but he has.” Dettori will be aboard Gosden’s Soul Sister, the impressive winner of last week’s Musidora Stakes, in the Oaks on 2 June – “she took me by surprise, she quickened twice, she travelled and she clocked a good time,” Dettori said of her trial success – while Running Lion, the Pretty Polly Stakes winner, will also represent the yard in the fillies’ Classic. Running Lion was a second high-profile galloper at Epsom on Monday, under her big-race rider, Oisin Murphy. The filly is a daughter of Roaring Lion, who just failed to get home when beaten two lengths in the Derby in 2018, again with Murphy in the saddle. “We were delighted with her at Newmarket and she came out of the race well,” Murphy said. “The idea was sensible work and to let her flow down the hill from the six and around Tattenham Corner, then once I got her organised, I let her go forward in the straight.” Murphy will be aboard The Foxes in the Derby, when like Running Lion, his mount will be stepping up to a mile-and-a-half for the first time. “I don’t know if she’ll stay, no one does,” Murphy said. “She might just find the final two furlongs too far, but it would be a nice way to find out in the Oaks, if I was still on the bridle approaching the three, like I was on her sire.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/the-extraordinary-bucket-list-of-laura-nuttall-who-died-of-brain-cancer-at-23","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:18:18Z","webTitle":"The extraordinary bucket list of Laura Nuttall who died of brain cancer at 23","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/the-extraordinary-bucket-list-of-laura-nuttall-who-died-of-brain-cancer-at-23","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/the-extraordinary-bucket-list-of-laura-nuttall-who-died-of-brain-cancer-at-23","fields":{"headline":"The extraordinary bucket list of Laura Nuttall who died of brain cancer at 23","bodyText":"Very few people would be able to say they had commanded a Royal Navy ship, met Michelle Obama and presented a television weather forecast. But Laura Nuttall from Barrowford in Lancashire did not let a terminal cancer diagnosis stop her from ticking off an impressive bucket list before her death on Monday at the age of 23. Diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, Nuttall said she had chosen “to do something about it and stay positive” when she was given only 12 months to live in 2018. “What sort of legacy will I leave if I just focus on myself and not others?” Nuttall said in 2021 while accepting an award for her charity work. “The day I was diagnosed with brain cancer, I just thought: ‘I’ve got two options … I could say all right, that’s fine, I’m going to sit here and die, or am I going to do something about it and stay positive?’ – and that is what I chose to do.” She was in her first university term at King’s College London in 2018 when, after a routine eye test, she received a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, which is incredibly rare in young women. Further tests found she had eight tumours and she was given just a year to live. Nuttall went through several rounds of treatment, including invasive brain surgeries, to extend her life and she was able to finish her university degree and graduate with a 2:1 in politics, philosophy and economics. In 2021, Peter Kay performed two sold-out Q&amp;A sessions at the 3,500-capacity Manchester Apollo, called Doing it for Laura, to raise money for her treatment. The money allowed Nuttall to travel to Germany for specialist treatment that was unavailable in the UK. She had previously had extensive cancer treatment including surgery to remove a tumour, only for it to come back days later. She described her bucket list as “never ending, because when it ends, I end”. Her mother, Nicola Nuttall, paid tribute to her daughter, writing that Laura had died in the early hours of Monday morning. She added: “She was fierce and tenacious to the end and it was truly the honour of my life to be her mum. “We are devastated at the thought of life without our girl, she was a force of nature.” Brain Tumour Research, a charity Nuttall had fundraised for, said it was “deeply saddened” at the news as “yet another brave soul lost to this devastating disease”. “Along with her family [Laura] did so much to raise awareness of this disease, and our thoughts are with her family at this time.” Fewer than 5% of people with Nuttall’s condition survive longer than five years. The life expectancy without treatment is three months. Laura’s completed bucket list Went fishing with Paul Whitehouse and Bob Mortimer (she caught a pike, they caught nothing). Graduated with a 2:1 in politics, philosophy and economics from Manchester University. Drove a monster truck, a bus, a 650-tonne crane, a tractor, a digger and a tank (after her driving licence was revoked due to seizures). Met Michelle Obama. Had a pub lunch with Peter Kay and danced on stage with him in front of 10,000 people. Had a song dedicated by Johnny Marr. Drove a London Underground tube train. Completed a skydive. Presented the weather on the BBC (“I thought it would be quite easy, but it’s really not”). Commanded a Royal Navy warship. Spent a day with police tackling a simulated riot. Travelled to the US. Went on safari in South Africa. Watched the Women’s Euro final at Wembley and received a video message from the England captain, Leah Williamson. Went sailing around the west coast of Scotland with the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust. Visited the Uncle Joes’s Mint Balls factory in Wigan and also the Heinz factory, receiving tins with her name on. Had a video chat with Malala Yousafzai. Visited the Royal Mint and pressed a 50p coin. Had tea at the Ritz with newscaster Sophie Raworth.

Born in Rochford, Essex, Lucy was the second daughter of Kate (nee Manley) and David Watts. While Lucy appeared a healthy baby, unbeknown to her parents she had an extremely rare genetic mutation. When she was a 14-year-old pupil at King John school in Thundersley her health deteriorated rapidly, rendering her a wheelchair-user, with complex medical needs requiring 24-hour care. Despite these setbacks she continued her education at home and in hospital, supported by the local authority education services, and she gained excellent GCSE results. She began her A-level studies at a local college but poor health meant she had to drop out. A referral to the J’s children’s hospice in Essex at the age of 17 was to be a turning point for Lucy in many ways. “For the first time since I became ill when I was 14, the J’s realised I was not just a patient with a host of medical problems; I was a person with goals, dreams, wishes and a desire to live.” She began to get involved with the work of the hospice, sharing insights into how their support helped her focus on the quality not quantity of her life. A natural public speaker and gifted writer, she was invited to become an ambassador for the national children’s palliative care charity, Together for Short Lives. I first met Lucy through our shared work for the charity. She was 18, defying the expectations of her medical team, and was energised and motivated to speak up and improve the rights and conditions of people like herself and their families. She used her platform to make recommendations to NHS programmes and charities and became a member of the NHS Assembly, which advises the board of NHS England. Her work attracted the attention of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, and they formed a lasting friendship, driven by a mutual desire to make access to good palliative care available to all who need it. She was a volunteer, patron or trustee to several charities and hospices, and in 2016, aged 22, was appointed MBE. Despite her deteriorating health Lucy spent the last years of her life working to shift the narrative around palliative care and tell people how it enabled her to focus on living while also empowering her to make plans for dying. The opening lines of her TEDx NHS talk summed her up when she said: “Would you believe me if I told you the best years of my life have been the years I knew I was dying?” Lucy is survived by parents and her sister, Victoria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/cocoa-planting-is-destroying-protected-forests-in-west-africa-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:03:05Z","webTitle":"Cocoa planting is destroying protected forests in west Africa, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/cocoa-planting-is-destroying-protected-forests-in-west-africa-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/cocoa-planting-is-destroying-protected-forests-in-west-africa-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Cocoa planting is destroying protected forests in west Africa, study finds","bodyText":"The world’s hunger for chocolate is a major cause of the destruction of protected forests in west Africa, scientists have said. Satellite maps of Ivory Coast and Ghana showed swathes of formerly dense forest had become cocoa plantations since 2000, according to a study. It found cocoa production was linked to 360,000 of a total 962,000 hectares (37.4%) of the deforestation since 2000 of protected areas in Ivory Coast, and 26,000 out of a total 193,000 hectares (13.5%) of the deforestation of similar areas in Ghana. The global trade in chocolate was estimated to be worth more than a trillion dollars last year. Cocoa, its most important ingredient, is produced from the seed of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree. It is native to South America, but most is now produced in Africa, with Ivory Coast and Ghana accounting for two-thirds of production. An estimated 2 million farmers in west Africa, operating farms of an average of just three to four hectares each, rely on cocoa for their income – usually less than $1 a day. They supply a complex network of middlemen, including public and private companies, who connect them to the world market, making the supply chain opaque. This obscurity has made cocoa production a haven for human rights abuses, and chocolate has long been linked to slavery. But the latest research also links the indulgent snack to the climate and biodiversity crises that risk the catastrophic breakdown of the planet’s biosphere. Like tropical regions, west Africa is rapidly losing its forests. Ivory Coast is estimated to have lost more than 90% since 1950, while Ghana is thought to have lost at least 65%. Cocoa production had been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in both countries, alongside mining, selective logging and other agriculture, but the extent to which it bore responsibility was not certain. An international team of researchers set out to accurately map the extent of cocoa cultivation in deforested areas using satellite imagery. They trained a neural network to scour the satellite imagery and identify cocoa plantations, double-checked their findings with teams on the ground in Ivory Coast and Ghana, then cross referenced them against areas mapped on the World Database of Protected Areas. In total, the researchers found, cocoa was being grown on more than 1.5m hectares of protected areas across the two countries, including nearly 14% of Ivory Coast’s protected areas and 5% of Ghana’s. In some classified forest or forest reserve areas, close to four-fifths of land had been cleared to grow cocoa. “The single most significant driver of deforestation in cocoa production is poverty,” said Kwame Osei, the country director for Ghana and Nigeria for the Rainforest Alliance, which was not involved in the research. “Cocoa farmers in west Africa receive a mere 6% of a chocolate bar’s retail price. They are on the losing end of the supply chain, too, bearing the brunt of chronically low prices and with few opportunities to negotiate. “Cocoa farmers are also on the front lines of the climate crisis, which leaves them vulnerable to drought, pests, and diseases that can decimate a harvest. In turn, land degradation often leads to the transformation of forest areas, including protected areas, into new cocoa plantations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-cycling-manxman-tour-de-france","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:00:40Z","webTitle":"Mark Cavendish’s longevity and breadth of success almost unique for a sprinter | William Fotheringham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-cycling-manxman-tour-de-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-cycling-manxman-tour-de-france","fields":{"headline":"Mark Cavendish’s longevity and breadth of success almost unique for a sprinter","bodyText":"The words “end of an era” should not be lightly used, but when Mark Cavendish hangs up his wheels later this season the term will apply, absolutely. The Manxman’s glittering career has lasted nigh on 20 years, if his first world title in 2005 is taken as a starting point. In bike racing, he is almost unique for a sprinter, both in terms of longevity, and the depth and breadth of his results. Generations of fastmen have come and gone as Cavendish’s list of wins has lengthened over the years, and all the while, from a brash, motormouthed youth, ready for anything, “Cav” has morphed into an elder statesman, a fixture in the sport, if occasionally a slightly terse one. The intensity of sprinters’ careers, as well as the frequent crashes, mean that as a breed of cyclist they rarely last long. To take just one example, the German powerhouse Marcel Kittel managed eight years, quitting at the age of 31. Cavendish’s absolute peak, the period where if he started a sprint stage of a major race it was virtually a given that he would win, lasted, arguably, from 2009 until 2012, when he became the only sprinter to win the iconic stage finish on the Champs-Élysées in four successive Tours de France, and was named by the newspaper L’Équipe as the best sprinter of all time. Now, Cavendish does not have the legs of the period of his pomp; then he was virtually impossible to beat thanks to his ability to read a finish, to motivate his teammates with his absolute certainty that he could win, capped by his ability to produce two devastating accelerations as the finish approached. As he rides out his final months with the Kazakh Astana squad, he has yet to win a race in 2023, but the desire to win and the self-belief common to all sprinters still run deep. When he sprang to prominence in 2004-2005, Cavendish was one of the first generation of riders to come through the newly formed British Cycling academy, under the aegis of Rod Ellingworth. The big breakthrough came with his first Grand Tour stage win in the 2008 Tour de France at Châteauroux; Cavendish had a ghost-written column in the Guardian at the time, so he made the front page with the headline, “Guardian man wins Tour de France stage; I told my manager to put €1000 on me”. The next few years were relatively seamless, until a new generation of sprinters headed by Kittel and Peter Sagan emerged; after 2013, Cavendish’s dominance ended, highlighted by his massive crash at the end of the first stage of the 2014 Tour de France in Harrogate. The wins kept coming, but not as straightforwardly as before, and it took until 2016 for him to return to his best, taking stage one of the Tour at Utah Beach in Normandy and with it the yellow jersey, completing a full house of all three leaders’ jerseys in all three Grand Tours. Three tough seasons followed, marred by crashes and illness, with his non-selection for the Dimension Data team in the 2019 Tour being a major blow. As a result, when Cavendish returned to Châteauroux 15 years on in his second spell at the Quickstep team, it was to take his 32nd Tour stage win after returning from a difficult spell marred by illness and depression. A few months earlier, few would have put money on that comeback when, as he floundered at the Bahrain team, Cavendish said he was likely to quit the sport. That he went on to take a further two stage wins in the 2021 Tour, equalling Eddy Merckx’s all-time record of 34 stage victories, will remain the most remarkable achievement of his career; had he not quit the 2008 Tour de France early in an abortive attempt to take an Olympic gold medal in Beijing, it is as certain as anything can be in sport that he would have won at least one more stage if not two. If the stage win record is the absolute highlight, there have been many other great Cavendish moments. The last-ditch sprint to win the world road race title in Copenhagen in 2011 is an obvious one, the culmination of a two-year campaign masterminded by Ellingworth, who also placed a major role in Cavendish’s only Monument win, the narrow victory in the 2009 Milan-San Remo. His silver medal in the 2016 race in Doha was different again, coming at the end of a hugely selective race in the desert crosswinds. In Grand Tour stage win terms, the final two stages Cavendish won in the 2012 Tour will always stick in the mind, with the yellow-jerseyed Bradley Wiggins leading out the Manxman in the rainbow jersey of world champion; my personal favourites are the stage to Aubénas in the 2009 Tour, when the peloton got smaller and smaller over a tough final climb, with Cavendish hanging tough for the win, while the 2013 stage win into Saint-Amand-Montrond was a cross-wind masterpiece created by the Quickstep team. As the Tour de France approaches, the questions will inevitably centre on whether Cavendish will ride and if so, whether he will be able to land the single stage wins that will take him beyond Merckx’s tally. In one sense, that is barely relevant. For a specialist to have drawn level with an all-rounder like Merckx was truly remarkable when it happened, and it is almost certain that the record will last well beyond the moment when the tears flow down the Manxman’s cheeks as he rides his last race. Cavendish is, and will remain, one of a kind, and there are few sportsmen of whom that can truly be said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/joe-taylor-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:49:07Z","webTitle":"Joe Taylor obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/joe-taylor-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/joe-taylor-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Joe Taylor obituary","bodyText":"My brother Joe Taylor, who has died aged 58 of cancer, worked as a film and television documentary cameraman for more than 30 years, including for the BBC’s Panorama and The South Bank Show on Sky Arts. Joe left Thurston upper school in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, at 16 with the sole ambition to be a cameraman. Aged 18, he went to London, doggedly pursuing his path, writing countless letters and knocking on unreceptive doors. Finally, in 1986, he was taken up by Crystal Film and Video in Harlesden, north-west London, where he quickly progressed from camera assistant to staff cameraman. In the late 1990s, Joe went freelance and ventured on a career that took him to every corner of the globe, feeding his lively mind and passion for history. He became one of the most sought-after documentary and current affairs cameramen of his generation, collaborating frequently with the presenter and writer Paul Kenyon and the producer and director Howard Bradburn, making beautifully shot, powerful and moving documentaries. He worked for Panorama from 2003 to 2020. In 2009, Joe filmed epic sequences of the lethal migration route from Africa to Europe. The film, Migrants, Go Home!, won a Royal Television Society award. Colleagues remember that no matter how difficult and risky the situation, Joe was always a delight to work with, delivering wonderful footage with grace and humour. Also for Panorama, Joe filmed memorable, poignant shots for Tsunami: The Survivors’ Stories, about the aftermath of the tsunami in Fukushima, in 2011. Cool in the face of danger, Joe was also kind – Kenyon said he was the only cameraman he knew who would take gifts to disaster zones. Always in demand, he also worked on BBC One’s Who Do You Think You Are? (2008-18), Channel 4’s Dispatches (2010-20) and The South Bank Show (2016-18), and was director of photography on The Amazing Grace, directed by Jeta Amata, for which he received the best cinematography award in the African Movie Academy Awards 2007. The youngest of four, Joe was born in Bury St Edmunds, to Muriel (nee Griffin), an auxiliary nurse, and Tom Taylor, an artist. Joe and his future wife, Lucy Walker, grew up as children together, married in 1995, and their son, Milo, was born in 1997. Joe lamented the loss of his future with Lucy and Milo. But, in spite of it all, he celebrated his amazing life and the people he loved. Brave, funny and empathic, he was great company and a fine professional.

Police officers are to search Barragem do Arade reservoir near the town of Silves in the Algarve, about 25 miles (40km) from Praia da Luz where Madeleine disappeared aged three from her family’s holiday apartment on 3 May 2007. The search is to be conducted by Portuguese officers at the behest of German authorities. The public prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig is investigating a convicted paedophile, Christian Brückner, 45. The German newspaper Bild first reported that Brückner may have had friends in the area. It is understood the prosecutor’s office is to issue a statement on Tuesday when the search of the reservoir and surrounding forest will begin in earnest. It is estimated it will take two days. On Monday, a road leading to Barragem do Arade reservoir, which has an average depth of about 14 metres, was blocked and police tents were seen. The reservoir was reportedly searched in 2008 and bones found in a bag were judged to be of “non-human origin”. It remains unclear why the police have chosen to search the reservoir again at this point. Images of Portuguese officers walking along dry tracks near the reservoir and sealing off areas with police tape began emerging on Monday afternoon. On Monday evening, Portugal’s judicial police released a statement confirming local media reports that they would conduct the search at the request of the German authorities and in the presence of British officials. This will be the first major operation of its kind since June 2014, when the Metropolitan police received permission from Portuguese officials to search the holiday resort of Praia da Luz with search dogs and ground-penetrating radar. Kate and Gerry McCann were dining at a nearby tapas restaurant when Madeleine disappeared, triggering one of the most highly publicised missing person cases in British history. German police said in June 2020 that the girl was assumed dead and Brückner was probably responsible for her disappearance. He has not been charged with any offences connected with Madeleine’s disappearance, and has denied any involvement. However, the Met police continue to treat it as a missing person case under Operation Grange, the multimillion-pound investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance. The Met referred all media inquiries to German authorities. Brückner is now in a German prison serving a sentence for rape. Last month, a German court said it was cancelling a sexual offences trial against Brückner on charges unrelated to McCann’s disappearance, on the grounds that the region where it is located is not the last place he lived in Germany. He was charged last year by German prosecutors in Braunschweig with three offences of aggravated rape of women and two offences of sexual abuse of children. The alleged offences took place in Portugal between December 2000 and July 2017. They are not linked to Madeleine’s disappearance. Earlier this month, the McCanns issued a short statement on their Find Madeleine campaign website to mark the 16th anniversary of her disappearance. “Today marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine’s abduction,” they said. “Still missing … still very much missed. “It is hard to find the words to convey how we feel … The police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough.” Last year, the McCanns lost a European court of human rights (ECHR) challenge to the Portuguese supreme court’s decision to throw out a libel case against a former detective who claimed they were implicated in their daughter’s disappearance. The couple sued Gonçalo Amaral, who led the botched police search for Madeleine in 2007, over statements he made in a book, documentary and newspaper interview alleging their involvement. In 2015, a Lisbon court ordered Amaral, a former detective inspector, to pay €500,000 (£440,000) to Madeleine’s parents. However, an appeal court overturned the decision the next year and, in 2017, the supreme court also found against the McCanns. The couple went to the ECHR to seek redress but a chamber of seven judges unanimously decided there had been no violation of their rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/22/fallen-leaves-review-deadpan-aki-kaurismaki-comedy-with-springtime-in-its-heart","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:46:33Z","webTitle":"Fallen Leaves review – deadpan Aki Kaurismäki comedy with springtime in its heart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/fallen-leaves-review-deadpan-aki-kaurismaki-comedy-with-springtime-in-its-heart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/22/fallen-leaves-review-deadpan-aki-kaurismaki-comedy-with-springtime-in-its-heart","fields":{"headline":"Fallen Leaves review – deadpan Aki Kaurismäki comedy with springtime in its heart","bodyText":"Aki Kaurismäki is the Finnish director who is notable for being not simply one of the directors who is always welcome in the Cannes competition, but also is one of the rarer subset who actually makes funny films; that is, actually-funny and not just arthouse-funny. Fallen Leaves is another of Kaurismäki’s beguiling and delightful cinephile comedies, featuring foot-tapping rock’n’roll. It’s romantic and sweet-natured, in a deadpan style that in no way undermines or ironises the emotions involved and with some sharp things to say about contemporary politics. I found myself rooting for the hero and heroine here in an uncomplicated way that I hadn’t for any other film at Cannes. It’s something which should be adored by Finnish film fanciers – who will incidentally savour the silent cameo from Finnish director and Cannes competition veteran Juho Kuosmanen – but it’s really for everyone and despite the title, this is a movie with springtime in its heart. Ansa (Alma Pöysti) is a woman who works in a supermarket on an exploitative zero-hours contract, and resents that part of her job is to throw away perfectly good food at the end of the day; a sullen security guard clocks her giving stuff like this to desperate hungry people, and she is fired for trying to take home an expired sandwich. Later Ansa finds herself in a karaoke bar where she meets a construction worker called Holappa (Jussi Vatanen), and there is a heartmelting connection between these two lonely people. They go on a very successful date to the cinema, although a subsequent series of terrible mishaps means that their relationship could be doomed – and here Kaurismäki may intend us to appreciate a filmic echo with An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Moreover, Holappa is a drinker, perhaps an alcoholic, and the booze brings out a nasty side. Idiotically, he doesn’t quite appreciate that drink is imperilling his chance at happiness with his soulmate. There’s something else too: periodically the characters will turn on the radio for the news (no one appears to have anything as modern as a smartphone or even a TV – the action could as well be happening in the early 60s); this is all about the Russian attack on Ukraine, which fills the listener with resentment, depression and defiance. And undoubtedly Kaurismäki intends us to realise something very specific: Finland is on the border with Russia.

One day while washing her hands in their downstairs bathroom, her ring was knocked over. Strand said she dived for the ring as it swirled perilously around the toilet, but she was too late. The ring – and her hopes of retrieving it – went down the toilet. Her husband’s attempts to remove the toilet and shake it outside and even snake a sewer camera down the line were draining, and they ultimately failed. More than a decade later, Strand was alerted to the newly discovered ring by her daughter, who found out about it on a neighborhood social media page after it had been finally found by local sewage workers and a search was launched for its original owner. “Mom, it’s got to be your ring,” her daughter told Strand. The ring had been discovered in Rogers, Minnesota, by three metropolitan council wastewater treatment workers. As they were fixing a malfunctioning machine, they came across a chisel, a clamp and Strand’s diamond ring. John Tierney, the manager of mechanical maintenance at the Rogers plant, called the odds of finding a ring in this way “astronomical”. In a statement, he said: “This ring could have been lost as long as 62 years ago or as recently as a couple of weeks. One thing that is known is that the ring would’ve entered the wastewater stream somewhere near Rogers, in north-west Hennepin county.” Hundreds of people called and emailed the plant in hopes it was their ring they once lost, including someone who lost their ring on their wedding night and an elderly woman hoping for “a miracle for this memory of a deceased husband”. It’s not the first time Strand has lost an expensive ring. In an interview with the Washington Post, she said she misplaced two other valuable pieces of jewelry: a five-sapphire-studded ring given to her as a Christmas present from co-workers and her original engagement ring, for which the recently found gold diamond ring was a replacement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/tim-scott-who-is-republican-2024-candidate-gop-senator","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:37:26Z","webTitle":"Tim Scott: 10 things to know about the Republican entering the 2024 race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/tim-scott-who-is-republican-2024-candidate-gop-senator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/tim-scott-who-is-republican-2024-candidate-gop-senator","fields":{"headline":"Tim Scott: 10 things to know about the Republican entering the 2024 race","bodyText":"Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina, formally announced his candidacy in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. One of an increasing number of nominees joining a fight that will include heavyweights Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, the South Carolina senator has risen quickly over the past decade to a position of prominence in the GOP. Here are 10 things to know about Tim Scott. Scott is a 57-year-old senator from South Carolina Scott grew up in South Carolina, attending a Baptist university and owning an insurance company before becoming involved in politics. He entered politics in the mid-1990s as a Charleston, South Carolina, city council member before running for Congress. Scott leans into a story of personal success and ‘personal responsibility’ Scott presents himself as an American success story. After growing up in poverty, living with his single mother in his grandparents’ house, Scott says he was mentored by a local Chick-fil-A business owner who taught him “conservative business principles” and allowed him to see a way to a better life. He has described his life as an “only in America” story of achievement, and claimed that people need to take “individual responsibility” for their lives. Scott was first elected to Congress in 2010 Scott staked his political claim amid a wave of conservative opposition to Barack Obama’s presidency. As a member of the hardline conservative Tea Party movement, he was endorsed at the time by the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and became a rising star of the party. After two years as a congressman, he was chosen in 2012 to replace the Republican senator Jim DeMint and appointed to the Senate. Scott is the sole Black Republican senator Scott is the only Black Republican senator, and was the first Black Republican elected to the US House of Representatives from South Carolina in over a hundred years. He has previously talked about his unique role as a Black Republican and the discrimination he has faced from authorities, but has claimed that liberals use race as a way to divide voters. He faced heated criticism from Black activists in 2021 after declaring “America is not a racist country” in response to a speech from President Joe Biden that condemned racism following a white supremacist mass shooting. Scott repeatedly emphasizes his evangelical faith Scott’s campaign is set to heavily court evangelical voters and lean into his conservative Christian identity – Scott has previously said he sees himself first as a biblical leader rather than a Republican or conservative. In a video declaring he was launching an exploratory committee for president, Scott said that he would “defend the Judeo-Christian foundation our nation is built on” and the committee’s first fundraising email included a call for a two-minute prayer in support of Scott. Scott has vowed to sign anti-abortion legislation if president Scott told NBC News reporters in April that he would sign “the most conservative, pro-life legislation that they can get through Congress” if elected president. Although Scott did not give a specific answer on how far into a pregnancy he would make abortion illegal, he did not rule out a six-week federal ban when asked to clarify his stance. ‘He is the exact opposite of Donald Trump’ Scott’s reputation is that of a “kind-hearted” and optimistic politician, Republican pollster Frank Luntz told the Guardian. It’s a stark difference in tone from Trump, whose apocalyptic vision of the United States and vows of retribution against his opponents have come to dominate the GOP. But Scott has praised Trump and advocated similar policies When the Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Scott in February what the differences would be between his platform and Trump’s, the senator responded “probably not very many at all”. He called the policies passed under Trump’s presidencies “monumental” and said he was “so thankful” that Trump was elected. Some Republican mega-donors have backed Scott’s campaign Wealthy conservative mega-donors are throwing some of their largesse in Scott’s direction, with the tech billionaire Larry Ellison giving $15m to a pro-Scott SuperPac. Scott’s campaign told reporters in May that it had about $22m cash on hand. Scott’s support from Republican voters appears very low A recent Morning Consult poll from 16 May showed Scott with only 1% of Republican primary voters supporting him. In contrast, that same poll placed Trump with 61% support among the same group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/indefinite-jail-terms-are-state-sanctioned-cruelty","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:34:11Z","webTitle":"Indefinite jail terms are state-sanctioned cruelty | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/indefinite-jail-terms-are-state-sanctioned-cruelty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/indefinite-jail-terms-are-state-sanctioned-cruelty","fields":{"headline":"Indefinite jail terms are state-sanctioned cruelty ","bodyText":"George Monbiot (The law is gone but they are still in jail: who will free Britain’s most wronged prisoners?, 18 May) succinctly captures many of the injustices of sentences of imprisonment for public protection (IPP). I wish to highlight two dimensions to this cruel and unusual punishment that were prevalent when I interviewed men serving the sentence as part of doctoral research I conducted as a (now former) prison chaplain. First, the risk they pose to the public is an important consideration to a parole board – rightly so. But the effect that indeterminate incarceration has on their wellbeing is not given proportionate weight. The deterioration in mental health with associated increased self-harm and suicide risks are well documented. This is state-sanctioned cruelty. Second, as Monbiot’s article suggested, many people serving this sentence have come from tragic backgrounds. This hope-crushing sentence inflicts further harm, for which the system of incarceration is largely responsible. What I experienced as most heartbreaking while a prison chaplain was that the humanity of those on an IPP sentence didn’t seem to count as much as it did for others in custody. Public risk always trumped personal risk to their own wellbeing, and they were blamed for the predictable way that they responded to the systemic harm inflicted on them. So they remained trapped in this Kafkaesque nightmare. Rev Dr David Kirk Beedon Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire • In 2008, Scotland introduced its equivalent to the IPP – the order for lifelong restriction (OLR) sentence. Two sentences meted out in the early years of the OLR carried a punishment of less than two years. Our son is one of those two prisoners. He was given an OLR of 17 months. Fifteen years later, he has spent one third of his life in prison and he is no nearer release. There are no courses for him to attend, there is no attempt at rehabilitation and no process for him to show that he has made progress. He has had 13 parole board hearings, but it is unable to release him without the consent of the Prison Service. That consent cannot be given as our son does not have the means to prove his reduced risk. This revolving-door system is designed never to halt. In 2021, our son was diagnosed with autism, which can reasonably be seen to have contributed to his misreading of cues that had him accused and convicted of sexual assault. The Prison Service does not accept that his diagnosis in any way reduces or influences his risk. Our MSP has tried to help us raise the issue with the justice department, without success. We have written many letters to the justice secretary since 2018. The Scottish government maintains the value of the OLR; the saddest part is its inability to learn from the experience in England and Wales with the IPP. Name and address supplied • I work as a psychotherapist in prisons. My concern with IPP sentences is that they perpetuate prisoners’ disempowerment. Prisoners’ motivation is to behave within the constraints of their sentencing. They undertake psychological programmes, but have to live with the fear that whatever they say or do will reflect on whether they can be released. They present with a dependency on a system to “fix them” rather than a belief in their own potential for change. The IPP narrative that a person is a danger to the public indeterminately can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or it can be challenged and a prisoner allowed to change.

I was at school in the 1970s and a much-needed recipient of free school meals. Like Katriona, the teachers who “saw” me helped me to see past the shame I felt at being an outsider. I lived with an alcoholic mother and her abusive partner, and at the age of 12 I slept with my bedroom window unlocked so that I could jump from my first-floor room if needed, the insidious fear that her partner might rape me ever present. Shame kept me from ever telling anyone what was happening at home. My mother kicked me out when I was 15, after her partner asked her to choose between us. I left school at 16, going straight into low-paid work. I took advantage of being able to retake my O-levels while claiming benefits and then did an access course that enabled me to complete a degree. I rewrote my story to a certain extent, but only because funding gave me that opportunity. The reference to there being a middle class “uniform” resonated; people assume so much because of how one dresses or speaks – they assume a set of shared values, and political and cultural beliefs. This is an important reminder and account of how wrong and outdated those assumptions are. I wish Katriona all the success and happiness she has fought for. Name and address supplied • Gosh, how Katriona O’Sullivan speaks for me. I am well aware that my life was saved by two of my teachers, a collective effort by my school that got me to university, and a support network of institutions through which my fees and a small maintenance allowance were paid. The parents of two of my friends made it possible for me to survive my last three years at school with some sense of what it feels like to be connected to a family. I too went on to work in second-chance education, and to rant fairly often about the ill‑informed judgments of people who haven’t been there themselves. I doubt many teachers these days leave the school gate with the energy to care in the way some of my teachers did for me.

AI is a threat to musicians, but principally to the “factory” approach of turning out endless derivative pop. AI can, of course, generate yet another samey‑sounding song and could replace any future Stock Aitken Waterman hit factory. It will not be able to replace original work. No AI is going to turn out unique lyrics such as “Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism” (Taylor Swift’s Anti‑Hero) for the simple reason that AI relies on guessing what a likely lyric would be. Until lots of people start using “narcissism” in their lyrics, it will be absent from AI-generated songs. Talented musicians should welcome AI as it will make their unique songwriting skills stand out and have greater value.

Colleen Molloy Leicester • Liz Truss’s visit to Taiwan has rightly been criticised by Alicia Kearns, the chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, as “the worst example of Instagram diplomacy” (Liz Truss in Taiwan calls for ‘economic Nato’ to challenge China, 17 May). But her behaviour also calls to mind the bellicose US secretary of state John Foster Dulles, who was said to be “the only bull who carries his own china shop around with him”. Colin Burke Cartmel, Cumbria • Why is Sir Jim Ratcliffe described as the “second wealthiest person in Britain” (Manchester United bidder Jim Ratcliffe up to second on UK rich list, 19 May)? In 2020, this pro-Brexit patriot changed his tax domicile to Monaco, a move that is estimated to save him billions in UK taxation. I imagine Britain rarely sees him. David Head Peterborough • Re Martin Amis’s writing (Obituary, 20 May), it’s worth recalling that in at least two of his books, Money and London Fields, he was writing, dazzlingly and dangerously, about a changing UK that was starting its journey to where we are now.

Munchetty said a flare-up at the weekend was so painful that her husband called an ambulance after she screamed for 45 minutes, yet she had struggled to obtain a diagnosis and treatment after decades of painful, heavy 10-day periods that sometimes made her pass out. She told her Radio 5 Live listeners: “Right now as I sit here talking to you: I am in pain. Constant, nagging pain. In my uterus. Around my pelvis. Sometimes it runs down my thighs. And I’ll have some level of pain for the entire show and for the rest of the day until I go to sleep.” Adenomyosis is a condition in which the womb lining grows deep within the muscular wall of the womb. Similar to endometriosis, in which lining grows outside the womb, it can cause severe symptoms, including extremely heavy and painful periods, bleeding, pain during and after sex or when going to the toilet. Adenomyosis is commonly diagnosed in women over 40, though it also affects younger women, and often it is only discovered at routine screenings, meaning many women have it without knowing. It is more common among women who have given birth more times, especially if they had a caesarian section. Possible treatment options include hormonal contraceptives, painkillers and anti-inflammatories. But in some cases surgery to remove the womb, a hysterectomy – which Munchetty said she is resisting to avoid early menopause – is the only solution, though this is not suitable for younger women who are hoping to conceive naturally. Munchetty said she had been told by doctors that she was “just unlucky”, and had to adapt her life to accommodate the pain and heavy bleeding, including setting alarms throughout the night to replace her tampon. She added that there is still no dedicated NHS page for adenomyosis. Jo Hanley, an adviser at Endometriosis UK, said the lack of specific guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adenomyosis made it difficult for clinicians to identify and treat it. “The lack of awareness, guidelines and research available for healthcare practitioners will filter down to the general public,” Hanley added. One guest on the show, Jen Moore, said the pain “feels like I have a bowling ball sat inside my pelvis pushing out on the bones from the inside out trying to break them”. She said she had to medicate every day and was regularly bedbound. Another guest, Amy, said she could not play with her 11-year-old daughter because of the pain. “It breaks my heart,” she said in tears. Ying Cheong, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Southampton, said adenomyosis and endometriosis were considered to be the same family of disease as they both involve endometrial glandular tissue somehow located outside the womb. But adenomyosis is more ill-defined and can only be diagnosed through ultrasound or MRI scans. About 40% of women with adenomyosis also have endometriosis, said Dr Alison Maclean, a women’s health researcher at the University of Liverpool. She added that although there had been recent advances in ultrasound and MRI diagnoses, “they are not 100% accurate, and the diagnostic criteria are still being debated”. Dharani Hapangama, a professor of gynaecology at Liverpool, said some clinical trials were looking into “desperately needed” new treatments, but that first basic science was needed to better understand the condition that is thought to affect 10% of women, as “we know very little about it”. “The main issue is the lack of funding for research,” she added. Prof Andrew Horne, professor of gynaecology at the University of Edinburgh and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said a third of people with adenomyosis do not experience any symptoms, but for those who do it can “severely impact” their quality of life and may affect fertility. A recent RCOG report based on interviews with over 800 women with gynaecological conditions showed that 80% said that their mental health had worsened due to long waits for treatment with painful symptoms. Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the first ever government-led women’s health strategy for England, published last summer, would “boost the health and wellbeing of women and girls across the country, while improving how the health and care system listens to all women”. She added: “It commits to transforming women’s health content on the NHS website and adding additional pages for conditions such as adenomyosis, making it easier to find relevant information.” An NHS spokesperson said: “We strongly encourage any woman concerned about their health to speak to their GP. “GPs should keep up to date with the latest Nice guidance on this condition so a speedy diagnosis and appropriate treatments can be carried out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/liverpool-ask-pgmol-for-explanation-on-decisions-in-aston-villa-match","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:10:05Z","webTitle":"Liverpool ask PGMOL for explanation on decisions in Aston Villa match","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/liverpool-ask-pgmol-for-explanation-on-decisions-in-aston-villa-match","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/liverpool-ask-pgmol-for-explanation-on-decisions-in-aston-villa-match","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool ask PGMOL for explanation on decisions in Aston Villa match","bodyText":"Liverpool have asked Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the professional referees’ body, to explain two contentious decisions that went against Jürgen Klopp’s side during the draw against Aston Villa on Saturday. Liverpool’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were effectively ended by the 1-1 draw at Anfield, where the referee John Brooks disallowed a Cody Gakpo goal for offside and showed the Villa defender Tyrone Mings only a yellow card for a high, studs-first foul on the Netherlands international. Brooks was sent to the pitchside monitor by VAR after Gakpo scored what would have been an equalising goal against Unai Emery’s team. He disallowed the effort for an offside against Virgil van Dijk, having decided that Ezri Konsa had not made a deliberate play to the ball when Luis Díaz headed Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross towards the Villa defender. In the first half, Mings escaped a possible red card for imprinting his studs into Gakpo’s chest, leaving the forward with gashes on his body and a torn shirt. Brooks booked the defender and VAR reviewed the incident. Liverpool want clarification on both decisions and have written to PGMOL to ask for an explanation. Klopp said after the game on Saturday: “Cody looks like he’s been sponsored by a brand with three massive cuts [across his chest]. You can’t do that without making a proper foul. I asked the ref why the offside goal was offside because offside should be clear, but it was a subjective decision. He thinks it is a not deliberate action from the defender but I think it is.” The Liverpool manager was serving a touchline ban on Saturday as a consequence of his comments about the referee Paul Tierney after the 4-3 win against Tottenham last month. Brooks was the fourth official who Klopp ran up to when celebrating Diogo Jota’s 96th-minute winner that day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/22/john-walker-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:09:34Z","webTitle":"John Walker obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/john-walker-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/john-walker-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Walker obituary","bodyText":"My father, John Walker, who has died aged 84, was an art historian and art critic who wrote more than 15 books on modern and contemporary art, including Art and Outrage: Provocation, Controversy and the Visual Arts (1999) and Art in the Age of Mass Media (2001). He was a regular contributor to art magazines and journals over the years, with that work focused mainly on the relationship between art and mass media. He was particularly interested in the impact of Vincent van Gogh, John Latham and the art collector Charles Saatchi. John was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, to Constance (nee Beale), a homemaker, and Albert Walker, a fish filleter at the local docks who went on to set up his own fish business. After John finished at Wintringham grammar school in Grimsby, in 1956 he studied at the University of Durham’s Department of Fine Art in Newcastle upon Tyne, staying on to do an MA after his degree and completing it in 1961. After graduation he taught at Sunderland College of Art before becoming an art librarian in London at Camden Public Libraries (1966-70) and at Hornsey College of Art library (1970-73). He then spent two years as a freelance writer and artist before taking on a job as a part-time art history lecturer at West Surrey College of Art (1975-81). Moving on to become a full-time senior lecturer at Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University London), he was appointed a full-time senior lecturer there in 1992, then reader in art and design history from 1993 until his retirement in 1999. Afterwards John continued as a freelance art critic and art historian, and also resumed his painting in 2005. Over the years he wrote for many publications, including Art Monthly, Art Review and Art &amp; Criticism. John was also a talented painter; he held several solo exhibitions of his work, including most recently at the View gallery, Thames Ditton (2006), the Pitt studio and gallery, Worcester (2007), and Maison Deco, Esher (2009). His works appear in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum and are also held by many private individuals. John was a kind and generous man, as well as a true scholar and a passionate advocate for the arts. His 1962 marriage to my mother, Margaret (nee Clark), ended in divorce in 1973. He is survived by me and a granddaughter, Olivia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/22/uber-suspends-diversity-chief-karen-bo-young-lee","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:02:24Z","webTitle":"Uber suspends diversity chief over ‘Don’t Call Me Karen’ events","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/uber-suspends-diversity-chief-karen-bo-young-lee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/22/uber-suspends-diversity-chief-karen-bo-young-lee","fields":{"headline":"Uber suspends diversity chief over ‘Don’t Call Me Karen’ events","bodyText":"Uber has suspended its head of diversity, equity and inclusion after Black and Hispanic employees complained about the workplace events she moderated exploring the experience of white American women under the title “Don’t Call Me Karen”. The ride-hailing app has confirmed that it has asked Bo Young Lee, who has led its DEI department for five years, to take a leave of absence while the company works out “next steps”. Her suspension is the latest wave of chaos to strike the $72bn company over its corporate culture. Lee’s suspension, which was first reported by the New York Times, follows mounting internal discontent over two “Don’t Call Me Karen” sessions that she convened on Zoom for up to 500 employees. The events, one in April and the second last week, were billed as “diving into the spectrum of the American white woman’s experience from some of our female colleagues, particularly how they navigate around the ‘Karen’ persona”. The sessions were held as part of a “Moving Forward” series of discussions on race and minority experiences organized by the company in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. The focus on the discomfort of white women specifically over the term “Karen” was denounced by several employees as being insensitive towards people of color. In internal Slack channels for Black and Hispanic Uber employees seen by the Times, workers said they had felt lectured at. “It was more of a lecture – I felt like I was being scolded for the entirety of that meeting,” one Black woman wrote. Another said that she didn’t understand the premise of the session: “I think when people are called Karens it’s implied that this is someone that has little empathy to others or is bothered by minorities others that don’t look like them. Like, why can’t bad behavior not be called out?” “Karen” has become shorthand for the actions of entitled white women who report Black and minority ethnic people to bosses or the authorities. In a notorious case in 2020, a white woman called the police on a Black man who was peacefully birdwatching in New York’s Central Park. According to the New York Times, after the first “Don’t Call Me Karen” event, a Black staffer argued that diversity sessions should not include “tone-deaf, offensive and triggering conversations”. Lee is reported to have replied: “Sometimes being pushed out of your own strategic ignorance is the right thing to do.” Uber has labored hard to improve and modernize its workplace culture after the 2017 resignation of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, following months of scandals. Under his leadership, the company was alleged by a whistleblower to have fostered widespread gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Kalanick’s replacement as chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, vowed to turn around the culture. His efforts have included a focus on DEI, led by Lee, whom he brought into the company in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/south-carolina-senator-tim-scott-2024-presidential-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:02:05Z","webTitle":"Senator Tim Scott launches bid for 2024 Republican presidential nomination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/south-carolina-senator-tim-scott-2024-presidential-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/south-carolina-senator-tim-scott-2024-presidential-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Senator Tim Scott launches bid for 2024 Republican presidential nomination","bodyText":"Tim Scott formally launched his presidential campaign on Monday, joining a growing field of Republican candidates looking to capture their party’s nomination and rob Donald Trump of another opportunity to face off against Joe Biden next year. “Under President Biden, our nation is retreating away from patriotism and faith,” Scott told a cheering crowd at Charleston Southern University in his home state of South Carolina. “Joe Biden and the radical left are attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. And that is why I am announcing today that I am running for president of the United States of America.” As the only Black Republican serving in the US Senate, Scott argued he had a unique perspective to offer on how conservative policies can best serve the American people, and he leaned into his optimistic vision for the future of the country. Scott’s mother joined him on stage at his campaign event, and he thanked her for “standing strong in the middle of the fight”. “We live in the land where it is absolutely possible for a kid raised in poverty in a single-parent household in a small apartment to one day serve in the People’s House and maybe even the White House,” Scott said. “This is the greatest nation on God’s green Earth.” The South Carolina lawmaker was introduced by the Senate minority whip, John Thune of South Dakota, who became the highest-ranking congressional Republican to endorse Scott in the presidential race. “I want all of America to know what South Carolina knows and what I know because I get to see it every day in the United States Senate – and that is that Tim Scott is the real deal,” Thune said. Scott’s announcement came three days after his team filed official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), confirming his plans to run for the White House. Later this week, the 57-year-old senator plans to visit the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where he has already met a number of Republican primary voters as part of his Faith in America listening tour that kicked off in February. Scott’s team will also begin airing TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire this week as part of a $5.5m ad buy that is scheduled to run through the first Republican presidential debate in late August. Scott enters the race with a significant fundraising advantage over many of his primary opponents. After Scott won re-election to the Senate in November, his campaign committee still had $22m in cash on hand that can now be used to bolster his presidential candidacy. According to the FEC, Scott’s existing funds represent the largest sum of money that any US presidential candidate has ever had when launching a campaign. Speaking to reporters last week, senior campaign officials insisted Scott’s funds would help him break out in a primary field where he has struggled to gain national recognition. The most recent Morning Consult poll showed Scott drawing the support of just 1% of Republican primary voters across the country. Even in his home state of South Carolina, which will hold its primary after Iowa’s and New Hampshire’s contests, Scott is stuck in fourth place, according to a Winthrup University survey taken last month. The South Carolina survey showed Scott trailing behind Trump, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Having served as South Carolina’s governor before joining the Trump administration, Haley also enjoys a home state advantage there, further complicating Scott’s path to victory. But Scott’s campaign advisers argued the senator’s optimistic message and compelling personal story would soon resonate with a large swath of voters. Scott was raised by a single Black mother, and his grandfather dropped out of school in the third grade to start picking cotton. Scott often summarizes his life story as “from cotton to Congress in one lifetime”, a theme he emphasized in 2021, when he was tapped to deliver the Republican response to Biden’s first presidential address to a joint session of Congress. Viewed as a rising star in the Republican party, Scott played a central role in the congressional negotiations over criminal justice reform. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Scott worked with two Democratic lawmakers – Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and then representative Karen Bass of California – to try to craft a bipartisan compromise on policing reform, but the talks collapsed in 2021 without any agreement reached. Although Scott has attempted to work across the aisle on criminal justice issues, he remains staunchly conservative on everything from gun safety to abortion access. He received an A rating from the Gun Owners of America last year, and he enjoys a voting score of 94% from the rightwing group Heritage Action, putting him 16 points ahead of an average Senate Republican. Scott also has an A rating from the anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America and has vowed to sign the “most conservative pro-life legislation” that can pass Congress if he becomes president. However, Scott has remained vague on his preferred cutoff point for banning abortion, telling NBC News last month: “I’m not going to talk about six or five or seven or 10 [weeks].” Scott will probably face more questions from voters about his policy agenda as he hits the campaign trail this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/james-cleverly-use-of-private-jet-described-as-ludicrous-extravagance","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T16:00:38Z","webTitle":"James Cleverly’s use of £10,000 an hour Succession-style jet ‘ludicrous’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/james-cleverly-use-of-private-jet-described-as-ludicrous-extravagance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/james-cleverly-use-of-private-jet-described-as-ludicrous-extravagance","fields":{"headline":"James Cleverly’s use of £10,000 an hour Succession-style jet ‘ludicrous’","bodyText":"In the cut-throat world of hit TV show Succession, it is the go-to private jet for the Roy dynasty, providing a backdrop to the programme’s high-level plotting amid luxury leather upholstery. Now it has emerged that an Embraer Lineage 1000E – lauded as “the crème de la crème of private business jets” – has also been the choice of aircraft for the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, on his eight-day tour of the Caribbean and Latin America. The jet costs more than £10,000 an hour to hire, and includes a lounge area with big-screen TV and a master suite for its main VIP, complete with queen-size bed, private bathroom and shower. Labour attacked the hire of the jet from a German aviation company as a “ludicrous extravagance”, which showed how Rishi Sunak’s government was out of touch with the public. While cheaper options are available, few would have come close to matching the accolades associated with the Embraer Lineage 1000E. Business Insider called it “one of the best luxury private jets money can buy” while Luxatic magazine described it as “the ultimate statement of wealth”. Cleverly was tweeting pictures of himself on Monday in the Amazon, part of a tour that has so far taken him to Kingston, Jamaica, and Cartagena and Bogotá in Colombia before scheduled stops in Chile and Brazil. He was due to use a keynote speech in the Chilean capital, Santiago, on Monday to set out the UK’s future relationship with Latin America. Although it is not known how many officials and advisers have travelled with the foreign secretary, up to 19 passengers and three crew can be seated on the Brazilian-built jet, which has been chartered from German VIP plane specialists Air Hamburg. When contacted to provide a quote for the cost of a 10-day round trip to Latin America, taking in two cities, the company indicated that the cost would be about €400,000 (£348,000). Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said travelling overseas was an essential part of the foreign secretary’s role. “But it beggars belief that – at a time when British families are running out of ways to make ends meet – James Cleverly thought it was appropriate to conduct this tour in the kind of luxury jet used by billionaires and pop stars, with British taxpayers footing the bill. “This sort of ludicrous extravagance at the public expense just shows how out of touch Rishi Sunak’s government are. No wonder their response to the cost of living crisis has been so utterly hopeless when they have such little concept of what ordinary life is like for people in our country.” A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “The foreign secretary’s job requires him to travel abroad to pursue UK interests. This was the most time-effective way to do this in this instance. Value for money is taken into account in all travel decisions and costs are regularly published for transparency.” Ministers will use commercial flights where practical and security considerations allow, according to the government. Cleverly was pictured meeting the UK’s ambassador to Colombia and other dignitaries at Cartagena after descending the steps of the distinctively marked jet. His trip came as British embassies across the region prepared to celebrate 200 years of UK-Latin America relations, according to the FCDO. In Chile, the FCDO said Cleverly would highlight the UK-Latin America partnership on tackling the climate crisis, upholding democracy and human rights and securing free and open supply chains of critical minerals. Latin America, home to 660 million people and with combined GDP of almost $6tn, was also described as an enormous potential market for the UK. From the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2022, there were 31 occasions where foreign secretaries – Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and Cleverly – chartered private jets or used one of the government’s fleet of ministerial planes to travel overseas, at a combined total cost of £4.6m. A freedom of information request by Thornberry’s team revealed that on none of those 31 occasions was the foreign secretary accompanied by members of the media or delegations of businesspeople, leaving the taxpayer to cover the entire cost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-seeks-new-poll-in-push-for-absolute-majority-after-election-win","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:59:11Z","webTitle":"Greek PM seeks new poll in push for absolute majority after election win ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-seeks-new-poll-in-push-for-absolute-majority-after-election-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-seeks-new-poll-in-push-for-absolute-majority-after-election-win","fields":{"headline":"Greek PM seeks new poll in push for absolute majority after election win ","bodyText":"Riding high on an election victory few expected, Greece’s prime minister has said he will push for a repeat poll “as soon as possible” after a landslide win that left the centre-right leader short of a parliamentary majority under a new voting system. Hours after his New Democracy party clinched almost 41% of the vote – 20 percentage points ahead of its main rival, the leftwing Syriza, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not waste time trying to form a coalition government. “I believe the message of the ballot is very clear,” he told the country’s president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, adding it was impossible to form a new government under the current parliament. “I intend to return the exploratory mandate this afternoon. We will proceed to elections as soon as possible.” A follow-up poll could be held on 25 June, a week earlier than originally envisaged, he said. As head of state, Sakellaropoulou had been due to hand Mitsotakis a three-day mandate to explore whether he could forge a governing alliance in the Greek parliament. Under a new electoral system of proportional representation, New Democracy fell five seats short of a majority in Athens’ 300-seat house despite an extraordinary victory in which the party not only routed its opponent but exceeded its landslide result in 2019, when Mitsotakis ousted the Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras. The leftwing party, by contrast, won just over 20%, posting what Tsipras would quickly describe as “an extremely negative result”. Under Greece’s constitution, the president must pass the mandate to the second and third parties – Syriza and the centre-left Pasok – if the winning party fails to form a government. But with Pasok ruling out an alliance and Syriza confronting almost impossible parliamentary arithmetic, the prospect of all three mandates being returned to Sakellaropoulou was being viewed as a foregone conclusion. Once the mandates run their course it is incumbent on the president to appoint a caretaker administration until elections are held. Before Sunday’s vote, Mitsotakis, 55, had repeatedly urged Greeks to give him the mandate that would allow him to form a single-party government that could implement an ambitious reform programme. The next ballot, crucially, will take place under an electoral system of reinforced representation that will grant the winning party as many as 50 bonus seats. It had been thought that the governing party’s popularity had been severely dented by a wiretapping scandal and a devastating train crash – events that cast a pall over Mitsotakis, a former banker, personally. But Syriza’s unexpectedly poor performance appeared to uphold the view that Greeks had voted for stability – despite many being perturbed by what has been perceived as democratic backsliding under the centre-right government with the spy scandal highlighting those concerns. In an election dominated by anxiety over the cost of living crisis, Greeks singled out the economy, citing memories of the country’s debt drama a decade ago and the punishing austerity meted out in return for emergency funds to keep the country afloat. Sunday’s ballot was the first since the EU and International Monetary Fund, which orchestrated the biggest bailout in global financial history to avert a Greek default, ceased supervising the country’s finances. Tsipras was previously catapulted into power on the back of widespread anger over austerity, transforming his party from a fringe group capable of picking up about 4% of the vote to a political force to be reckoned with. Hours after his devastating defeat on Sunday party officials said the 48-year-old would lead the party to elections in June but would immediately press ahead with “a change of strategy”. But there was also a sense that Tsipras’s days at the helm of Syriza could also be numbered if June’s electoral result is as disastrous. In a televised address after convening his executive committee, Tsipras said the forthcoming poll was an opportunity to “reverse the prospect of an uncontrollable ruling prime minister”, saying Syriza was not only “here to stay” but the role of the left in the country’s political life was also at stake. “I have learned in difficult moments to assume responsibility and not to abandon the fight,” he said. “I am here and I am not going to abandon the battle in the middle, no less, of a difficult fight. Yesterday was election day; today is the first day of the fight for the next elections.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/22/max-malins-saracens-sale-premiership-rugby-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:53:42Z","webTitle":"Max Malins has ‘unfinished business’ in title decider and final Saracens match","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/max-malins-saracens-sale-premiership-rugby-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/22/max-malins-saracens-sale-premiership-rugby-final","fields":{"headline":"Max Malins has ‘unfinished business’ in title decider and final Saracens match","bodyText":"Max Malins will play his final game for Saracens this weekend in a Premiership title decider that he has described as “unfinished business”. When Malins joined Saracens in 2015 he hitched his wagon to a dynasty that would claim three European crowns and four domestic titles in five years. But a salary cap scandal and subsequent relegation in 2020 was destabilising and humbling. Last year Saracens had a shot at reestablishing themselves as the best team in the land but a late Freddie Burns drop goal enabled Leicester to steal their glory. “That was hard to take,” Malins said before facing Sale Sharks at Twickenham on Saturday. “I’ve yet to play in a Premiership final and win it so it’s a massive motivation for me. I need this for myself.” Malins is joining Bristol next season with the promise of regular game time in his preferred position at full-back. “That was a big factor in my decision making,” he said. “It’s where I can showcase my skills most.” Not that Malins has been quiet on the wing. He was top tryscorer last season with 16 and has contributed 10 in the league during the current campaign. The 26-year-old has been one the beneficiaries of a new-look Saracens, who have played an untypical expansive game since that defeat to Leicester. “We changed our mindset to be more open to opportunity,” he said. “Looking back at the final [last year], we very much got sucked into Leicester’s game and closed ourselves off to anything. There was a big emphasis during pre-season to open ourselves up to opportunity. “It will take massive bravery and massive courage to continue what we have done [in the final]. Not every decision might be the right one and you’ve got to be able to take on that risk versus reward. We’ve got plenty of reward from it over the season. If it does go wrong we’ve got to clean it up and we’ve got the team that can do that.” If English rugby elected its champions based on league form – as is the case with football – Saracens would have wrapped up the title with a game to spare. Instead they must risk it all in a one-off shootout. “Anything can happen,” Malins said. “The playoff system attracts interest. It puts a lot of emphasis and emotions on these big games.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2023/may/22/rod-kedward-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:46:56Z","webTitle":"Rod Kedward obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/22/rod-kedward-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/may/22/rod-kedward-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Rod Kedward obituary","bodyText":"Through his books Resistance in Vichy France (1978), In Search of the Maquis (1993) and The French Resistance and its Legacy (2022), the historian Rod Kedward, who has died aged 86, transformed understanding of rural France under Nazi occupation during the second world war. His general history, La Vie en Bleu: France and the French Since 1900 (2005), also attracted a wide readership and the conferences he organised in 1984 and 1994 at the University of Sussex on Resistance and Liberation in France turbo-charged the field. Kedward’s interest in “history from below” – as experienced by ordinary individuals rather than governments or leaders – prompted his decision in the 1970s to work on the grassroots of resistance and conduct interviews with witnesses. It was a bold move. French colleagues warned of the possibility of fabrication and fantasy. Nonetheless he was determined to talk to witnesses from the time. This was not just to allow them to have their own voice, which he ensured by incorporating passages from interviews into his books, but also to use oral history to inform his approach to the archival evidence. Previous historians of the period had tended to focus on urban resistance and to assume that rural areas adhered to the regime of the collaborationist Vichy government of Philippe Pétain and supported Pétainist policies that valued farming and a return to agriculture. Kedward’s work showed that there was good evidence of a resistance culture in the countryside. Drawing on “carnival” theory from anthropology (which examines how established order can be turned upside down) – Kedward showed how the maquis (the bands of rural resisters) subverted the Vichy rule of law in the name of higher justice, to create an “outlaw culture”. In The French Resistance and Its Legacy, for instance, he relates a “test” in resistance technique that he had to undergo in 1972 before being allowed to interview the resister Louis de la Bardonnie: “He made me steal a notice from the outside wall of a local police station before he would agree to talk, and then he made me put it back.” Oral histories revealed a wide variety of motivations and levels of engagement in resistance depending on the resister’s location, culture and individual experience. Kedward’s research on southern France drew attention to tradition and folklore as sources of inspiration. Resisters in the Cévennes, for instance, linked their commitment to the 18th-century Camisard revolt against Louis XIV’s repression of Protestants, while in the neighbouring department of the Aude, they were motivated by the Cathar heretics of the Middle Ages. Kedward also highlighted how women used traditional gender roles to disguise their resistance activities. Their ruse to distribute clandestine publications or transport weapons in shopping bags and children’s prams was so effective that they escaped notice both at the time and by historians subsequently. Observations of women’s behaviour in interview led Kedward to discover how “the women at the doorway” had acted to distract and mislead, covering for a husband or accomplice. Born in Hawkhurst, Kent, Rod was the younger son of the Rev Neville Kedward, a Methodist minister, and Nancy (nee Judge), a drama teacher. He was educated at Kingswood school in Bath, and studied history at Worcester College, Oxford. As a postgraduate student at St Antony’s College, he moved into French history and France became his preferred destination for holidays and sabbaticals. His love of France, its people and its provincial richness marks all his work. In 1962, the historian Asa Briggs, vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex, invited Kedward to join what was the first of the new universities as lecturer in history. He thrived on the excitement of this new, “plate-glass” interdisciplinary university in Brighton, which caught the momentum of the 60s. He frequently borrowed models from anthropology, sociology, literary and film studies in his research and his writing illuminates how history can benefit from this cross-fertilisation of disciplines. He remained at Sussex, promoted in 1991 to professor of history, until his retirement in 2002. Generous with his time, Kedward offered encouragement to generations of scholars. He was a charismatic and engaging speaker, whose students would applaud his lectures. Colleagues and former students became firm friends. An active Labour party member with anarchist sympathies, Kedward campaigned against repression of all kinds. In the early 70s, he wrote for the alternative newspaper Brighton Voice, about issues including squatting, anti-racism, individual rights and tenants’ protests. In 1973-74, he participated in the Larzac farmers’ battle against the extension of a military base in south-west France and supported the movement to recognise the Occitan language of southern France and its border region. Unusually for a British historian of France, Kedward’s work was translated and admired by the French. In 1994, In Search of the Maquis was awarded the Philippe Viannay prize for an outstanding contribution to the history of resistance and, in 2011, he was made a commandeur dans l’Ordre des Palmes Academiques for services to French culture. In 2014, Kedward realised his ambition to link the French resistance to other resistance organisations, such as the civil rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement and dissidence in communist eastern Europe, with the creation of the Archive of Resistance Testimony at Sussex University. This has taken on a particular relevance since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Kedward was also prominent in the Secret World War Two Learning Network, which commemorates British heroes of the Special Operations Executive. Family was central to Kedward’s life. In 1965, he married Carol Wimbleton, who survives him, along with their children, Josh and Jess, and grandchildren, Isabella, Niamh, Lucien and Rufus. • Harry Roderick Kedward, historian, born 26 March 1937; died 29 April 2023"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/22/letter-elain-harwood-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:36:53Z","webTitle":"Letter: Elain Harwood obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/letter-elain-harwood-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/letter-elain-harwood-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Elain Harwood obituary","bodyText":"Through her contribution to the Post-War Listing Steering Group, Elain Harwood ensured the preservation of 20th-century buildings that could well have been lost or compromised, including the Festival Hall in London and the Byker estate in Newcastle.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, was killed on 22 May 2013 by terrorists near his barracks in Woolwich, south London. His attackers, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, were found guilty of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Lyn Rigby told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that her son would never be forgotten, and that she wanted to use his legacy to do more for bereaved families. “I still speak to Lee, usually at the nighttime when I get time to myself, when everybody has gone to bed,” Rigby said. “I’ll sit and light a candle, and look at Lee’s picture and just talk away to him. Sometime I’ll laugh, sometimes I’ll cry and sometimes I’m angry. I just do it every single morning when I open my eyes. I have a picture of Lee in the bedroom and I’ll speak to him every morning. That gives me a focus to get up and to carry out what I’ve got to do that day.” Rigby said she believed her son was able to hear what she was saying. “Things happen in the house, things can fly off the windowsill or the mantlepiece and there’s nothing to explain why this has happened. I do feel warmth in the nighttime and feel that Lee is there, sat next to me, giving me a hug and telling me that he loves me,” she said. “For the table, when we have family occasions and all get together for a celebration there’s always an empty chair there for Lee at the dining table.” After his death, the Lee Rigby Foundation was set up as a support network for bereaved military families, and has fundraised to provide caravans for the families to use. “Lee was a very gentle soul,” Rigby said. “He wasn’t perfect – he had his awkward and stubborn sides – but he had a heart of gold and would help anybody. He would want me to do this, and to carry on in Lee’s name for the bereaved families. I think Lee would be proud of what we are doing.” Rigby said her most treasured memory of Lee was him throwing Coco Pops cereal down the stairs when he was a toddler. “It just sticks in my mind – as I said, he wasn’t perfect, he had his days when he was very difficult at times,” she said. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of Fusilier Lee Rigby on the 10th anniversary of his senseless murder. We will never forget the appalling events of that day and on behalf of all Londoners, I want to extend deepest sympathies to his loved ones and all those impacted by his death. “London will never be cowed by terrorism and Londoners will always stand together in the face of hate and division and those who wish to harm our way of life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/westminster-suella-braverman-speeding-home-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:32:19Z","webTitle":"Get a grip, Westminster – Suella Braverman speeding is hardly the issue of the day | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/westminster-suella-braverman-speeding-home-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/westminster-suella-braverman-speeding-home-secretary","fields":{"headline":"Get a grip, Westminster – Suella Braverman speeding is hardly the issue of the day","bodyText":"Trivial is the default mode of British politics. Whether or not the home secretary did ask civil servants and an aide to help her get out of a group speed-awareness course, and if she did, whether she was right to do so, is not the most urgent issue of the day. Yet, as MPs this week gathered round the Westminster village pump, it pushed immigration, the NHS, Ukraine and the G7 off the agenda. Suella Braverman had few qualifications for high office and even fewer to handle Britain’s vexed immigration challenge. Her workload would indeed be a fit topic of discussion. But she has also, like the archbishop of Canterbury, fallen foul of Britain’s driving speed limits. Offenders are offered a choice between a fine and licence points or a speed awareness course, which they aren’t allowed to attend again in three years. It is alleged that Braverman asked if she might do the awareness course one-on-one instead of in a group. This is apparently a facility offered to some people. Reportedly, Braverman first inquired of a civil servant, who correctly but fastidiously refused it as a private matter. She then asked her political adviser, who inquired and was told she had to do a normal course. For a senior minister guilty of a minor offence this process seems reasonable, albeit with a suspiciously harsh outcome. Braverman took it on the chin, paid the fine and took three points on her licence rather than doing the course. It would take an Alan Ayckbourn to turn this into a full-blown scandalous drama. But for Westminster it has been Only Fools and Horses from start to finish. People in top jobs are surely entitled to have people round them – personal secretaries, drivers, diary-keepers – to ease the borderland between work, family and moments of leisure. There is a borderline between private and public duties that the civil service must respect in the taxpayer’s interest. It will be up to Rishi Sunak and his ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, to determine if that line was crossed here, and whether the ministerial code has been broken. But in the affair as a whole, Parkinson’s law of triviality has applied: the less the importance, the more the attention. The Braverman affair is like the Chequers chef trying to work out whose lunch should be credited to which departmental budget while the massive defence estimates are being passed on the nod. One upside might be that the home secretary and archbishop of Canterbury form a lobby to induce a less centralist attitude to speed limits. Some make sense, some should be lower and some higher. This should depend on local context, not central guidance. London has been reduced to a heaving morass of roadworks, low traffic neighbourhood diversions and a one-size-fits-all, 20mph speed limit in several boroughs. Opponents of low-traffic neighbourhoods argue that journeys reduced are more than cancelled out by longer distances travelled. London drivers now have eyes only for their speedometers, and it seems few people – not taxis, buses, motorbikes or even police cars – stick to the 20mph limit, a limit now extending across many towns and cities. The result is a vast speed trap available to any local authority eager to boost its income. Braverman’s speeding ticket thus joins Downing Street parties and non-dom spouses in the dressing-up cupboard of British politics. Much such behaviour may be reprehensible, but its evils should be kept in proportion. They are how the system crowds out discussion of things that matter. MPs should go on a seriousness awareness course.

Backlash as Berlin mayor refuses to use gender-neutral language","bodyText":"Berlin’s recently appointed conservative mayor has said he will refuse to use gender-neutral language in office, insisting he wanted to use a language “that everyone understands”. Kai Wegner, who became mayor of the German capital last month, signalled in an interview with the Bild am Sonntag a readiness to dispense with gender-neutral language altogether in the city’s administration, although appeared to later backtrack after coming up against strong opposition to his remarks. In the Bild interview, Wegner said: “I have yet to sign a letter in gendered language [gender-neutral language]. What’s important to me is that the administrative language is comprehensible. Everyone can speak as they like in private, but I want to speak the German that I learned in school and that everyone understands.” Wegner justified his argument by emphasising the importance of ensuring that migrant newcomers to Germany, who are encouraged to learn German, did not find the language more difficult than it actually was. “We expect that people who come to Germany learn German and in particular it shouldn’t be the authorities who make it unnecessarily difficult for them to do so,” he said. After a backlash, in which critics called his reasoning disingenuous, he qualified his remarks in an interview for the Tagesspiegel newspaper, in which he insisted he was not planning a general ban on gender-neutral language in the city hall. “I am interested in having a language that is understandable,” he told the newspaper. “Everyone is free to speak as they like, but I for one will continue to write as I learned to do in school. For this reason I have not and will not sign a letter sent from my senate chancellery in gendered language.” This is arguably more complicated than it would be in English because the German language genders words into male, female, and neutral. According to traditional language rules, a male citizen is a Bürger, a female a Bürgerin. But when male and female citizens are referred to collectively or plurally, the generic masculine automatically applies and they are termed Bürger. As a response to the outrage that has grown in recent years in particular over the use of the generic masculine, a gender-neutral alternative form of the language has been increasingly on the rise, in which, most commonly, the so-called gender star, an asterisk, is placed in front of the feminine word ending, for instance making Bürger*innen out of Bürger. The trend has its strong opponents, who complain it makes the language clumsy and difficult to pronounce. But Johanna Usinger, one of the proponents of the alternative form who created an open-source online gender dictionary geschicktgendern.de (clever gendering) in 2015 to offer inspiration as to how to gender more correctly, eloquently and intelligibly, argued: “Our thinking is influenced through language. If it’s only the masculine that’s named, this conjures up a mental image which often contradicts reality.” She said that ultimately, gender-neutral language was an expression of “democratic principle and behaviour” that “demonstrates an appreciation of everyone, regardless of their sex”. A campaign against gender-neutral language has been backed in particular by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), as well as Wegner’s party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). The CDU arm themselves with the argument that generic masculine language did nothing to hinder the rise of Angela Merkel. Even though Germany’s constitution refers repeatedly to a Bundeskanzler or male federal chancellor, it did not stop her from rising to the position, as the first ever woman, they argued. The word Bundeskanzlerin (female chancellor) only came into common usage in 2004 during the election campaign that propelled Merkel to power, when it entered the prestigious Duden German language dictionary for the first time. Before then, the word had not officially existed. However, lexical anomalies remained throughout her four terms in office, including the fact she operated from the Bundeskanzleramt or federal chancellery building, whose name suggests it is meant only for a man."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/22/jim-brown-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:24:38Z","webTitle":"Jim Brown obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/jim-brown-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/22/jim-brown-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jim Brown obituary","bodyText":"The greatest running back in the history of American football, Jim Brown, who has died aged 87, was one of the finest all-round athletes of his era, excelling in both football and lacrosse. He quit pro football at the peak of his career to pursue an acting career, and became an iconoclastic civil rights activist. But the ferocity that made him a fine player and imposing figure of black pride also expressed itself in repeated accusations of violence against women. When Brown entered the National Football League in 1957, runners were either big fullbacks or smaller, more shifty halfbacks. At 6ft 2in and 16st 6lb, Brown was both; big as a fullback, but with the speed, balance and skill to set up his blockers and the power to run through tacklers. His battles with the New York Giants linebacker Sam Huff, basically the same size, helped build the NFL’s violent image. Asked how he tackled Brown, Huff said “you grab on and pray for help”. In his nine seasons with the Cleveland Browns, Brown won the league’s rushing title eight times, was first-team all-pro eight times, and was chosen as the league’s most valuable player (MVP) three times. He retired as the league’s career rushing leader, and his average of more than 100 yards rushing per game, and five yards per carry, still stand out. In 1964 he began acting, in the western Rio Conchos. In the summer of 1966, filming The Dirty Dozen in Britain, shooting overran and collided with the start of his team’s training camp. When the Browns’ owner Art Modell announced that he would fine Brown $100 for each day he missed, a small but face-saving amount, Brown quit. He went on to appear in nine more films in the next three years, including Ice Station Zebra (1968) and 100 Rifles (1969), in which his love scene with Raquel Welch broke Hollywood’s long-standing norms against black/white sexual contact. In 1964 Brown watched Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) beat Sonny Liston for the world heavyweight crown. After the fight, he met up with Clay, the singer Sam Cooke, and Malcolm X, an event dramatised in Regina King’s 2020 film One Night In Miami. Three years later Brown called a summit in Cleveland, at which sports stars including the basketball players Bill Russell and Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) backed Ali in his stand against being drafted into the Vietnam war. It took place at the headquarters of Brown’s Black Economic Union, started to encourage self-improvement in the black community. He thought of civil rights in terms of “green power” (driven by money), explaining that in 1963 he felt Martin Luther King was “a great man … but I for one will not march down the street and kneel and pray for my rights. That is just not my shit.” This self-reliance was part of his upbringing. Brown was born on St Simons Island, Georgia, a tightly knit community founded by freed slaves. His father, Swinton “Sweet Sue” Brown, was a boxer who abandoned the family, and young James was raised by his great-grandmother Nora, whom he called Mama, and by his grandmother and his aunt, while his mother, Theresa (nee Powell), moved north to find domestic work in Long Island, New York. Aged eight, Jim joined her, becoming a star athlete at Manhasset high school, but because “she was more involved with her boyfriends than me”, he moved in with his girlfriend’s family, and found sports coaches who provided role models. More than 40 colleges wanted him to play football, even though he had set a Long Island record in basketball by averaging 38 points per game, but it was a local lawyer, Ken Molloy, a former lacrosse star at Syracuse University, who steered him there. What Brown did not know was that his “scholarship” was actually funded by Molloy and other local supporters, because the Syracuse football coach Ben Schwartzwalder did not want “another coloured person on my team – they are too much trouble”. Brown eventually earned a scholarship, but battled Schwartzwalder for respect and playing time until his talent became too obvious to ignore. Meanwhile, he found support from the lacrosse coach Roy Simmons, and his ability to clamp the lacrosse stick’s net against his chest, holding the ball tight where it could not be checked away, forced a change in the game’s rules. He starred on the basketball team, and competed in athletics while playing lacrosse, often running between matches. Despite only limited practice, in 1955 Brown finished fifth in the US national decathlon championships. The Cleveland Browns took Brown with the sixth pick of the NFL draft in 1957. In his ninth game he ran for 237 yards, a league record. The next year he broke the single season rushing mark, scored 17 touchdowns and won his first MVP award. He broke that single-season mark five years later. Brown’s film career turned to blaxploitation, and he often teamed up with former NFL stars such as Fred “the Hammer” Williamson and Bernie Casey. When that market dried up, he moved to television, then revisited blaxploitation in knowing homages including I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988) and Original Gangstas (1996). He played a boxer helping save Earth in Mars Attacks! (1996) and a coach in Oliver Stone’s football drama Any Given Sunday (1999). He did broadcast commentary on football, boxing and ultimate fighting. He also founded Amer-I-Can, an organisation that tackles gang violence by dealing directly with the gangs themselves. In the 1978 film Fingers, directed by James Toback (who in 1971 had written Jim, a creepy memoir of living with Brown while writing a feature for Esquire magazine), Harvey Keitel loves Tisa Farrow, who is involved with a nightclub owner, Dreems, played by Brown, who stages a three-way with her and Tanya Roberts, while Keitel watches. Then, indifferently, he cracks their heads together. This seemed a stark comment on Brown’s own relations with women. A series of accusations of rape and assault against him were resolved in acquittal or with the victim failing to press charges. These included the 1968 case when an argument between Brown and his girlfriend Eva Bohn-Chin, which started when she discovered his affair with the feminist activist and writer Gloria Steinem, ended with Bohn-Chin falling off a balcony. Johnnie Cochran, later OJ Simpson’s lawyer, got a 1985 rape suit against him dismissed. Brown’s only convictions came in 1978, when he was jailed for a day and fined $500 for choking a male friend in an argument over the placing of a golf ball during a match; and in 1999 when, during a row with his second wife, Monique, he smashed the windows of her car. He was found guilty of criminal damage to the car, fined and sentenced to counselling and community service. He wrote two autobiographies and was the subject of a TV documentary by Spike Lee, Jim Brown: All-American (2002), and many books, including Dave Zirin’s warts-and-all Last Man Standing (2018) and Mike Freeman’s pre-#MeToo Jim Brown: The Fierce Life of An American Hero (2006). The sportswriter Howard Bryant pointed out that “while Jim Brown is heroic, he is no hero.” Brown is survived by Monique (nee Gunthrop), whom he married in 1997, their son, Aris, and daughter, Morgan, and by two sons, James Jr and Kevin, and a daughter, Kim, from his first marriage, to Sue Jones, who divorced him in 1968. • James Nathaniel Brown, athlete, actor and activist, born 17 February 1936; died 18 May 2023"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/patients-england-nhs-app-book-private-hospitals-backlog-waiting-lists","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:22:31Z","webTitle":"Patients in England to be asked to use NHS app to book private hospitals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/patients-england-nhs-app-book-private-hospitals-backlog-waiting-lists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/patients-england-nhs-app-book-private-hospitals-backlog-waiting-lists","fields":{"headline":"Patients in England to be asked to use NHS app to book private hospitals","bodyText":"Patients waiting for NHS care will be encouraged to use the health service’s app to book their operation at a private hospital under government plans to tackle the huge care backlog. The proposal will be included in the forthcoming report of the “elective recovery taskforce” Rishi Sunak set up last December to come up with new ideas. Under the plan the role of the NHS app would be enhanced so that patients stuck on the 7.2 million-strong waiting-list in England could use it to check how long they would have to wait for surgery at NHS and private hospitals. They would then book their procedure at whichever best suited them, it is understood. The prime minister is keen to see a major expansion in the number of NHS patients who exercise their existing right to choose where they have treatment as a key way of cutting the NHS backlog. Sunak has made cutting NHS waiting times one of his five pledges to the British public. The taskforce’s report will also recommend that the number of people undergoing surgery is increased “as far as possible via the independent sector”, according to a report in the Times. It will also reportedly say that patient choice – originally introduced by Labour under Tony Blair – should be “the default mechanism” for any patient who is referred by a GP for hospital care. However, an expert on the private sector’s role in providing NHS care voiced scepticism on Monday about what difference the app plan would make to patients’ behaviour and the size of the backlog. Charles Tallack, director of data analytics at the Health Foundation thinktank, said that any steps to bring down the elective care waiting lists were welcome. But, he added: “It is not immediately apparent how a new app would help achieve that, especially when patients are already able to book NHS treatment with a private provider via the NHS Choose and Book website.” Tallack added: “Key to the challenge of scaling up NHS-funded elective care in the independent sector are funding and staffing, both of which are severely constrained.” Private providers currently undertake about 140,000 of the 1.5m NHS-funded operations performed each month. Labour is also keen to maximise any spare capacity private hospitals have. Research published by the Health Foundation thinktank earlier this month warned that private hospitals were likely to be able to play only a limited role in busting the backlog. It found that private providers have significantly increased the amount of eye surgery they carry out over recent years – mainly cataract removals – and now do 38.6% of all such procedures, up from 23.3% before Covid-19 hit in early 2020. However, they have only increased the proportion of NHS-funded orthopaedic operations they perform – mainly hip and knee replacements – from 26.8% before the pandemic to 31.2%. Tallack said at the time that the study showed “while it has important role to pay, the independent sector is not a panacea for bringing down waiting lists, despite it being at the heart of the elective recovery plan”. The Centre for Health and the Public Interest, a thinktank that focuses on the NHS’s relationship with the private sector, has said that private hospitals employ very few doctors directly and rely for the most part on NHS medics working part-time for them on top of their main job. David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, and a member of the taskforce, said private hospitals hoped that the taskforce report “will ensure patients are fully informed about their options to choose the most appropriate provider for them, including from the independent sector. “This will ensure more patients are able to get faster NHS treatment, free at the point of use.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2023/may/22/readers-favourite-moments-from-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:17:46Z","webTitle":"Readers’ favourite moments from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/22/readers-favourite-moments-from-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2023/may/22/readers-favourite-moments-from-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom","fields":{"headline":"Readers’ favourite moments from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom","bodyText":"‘The best thing to do is something random’ The best thing is doing something random in the game – climbing up something, fighting something big and boss-like – before you’re actually supposed to in the story. I have been playing games since I was four, and I’ve always loved Zelda games for the freedom you get and the feeling you’ve done something you’re not supposed to that isn’t found in many other titles. I’d say so far – and I’m only a few hours in – there are two favourite moments for me. One is when cooking and hearing Link humming music from the series. The other was climbing a Skyview Tower, assuming I had to so I could see the world map, and reaching the top only to find ... nothing. Then moving along in the story and finding out what it was actually for! As always, pre-empting what I’m supposed to do in a Zelda game. Tom Fogden, 43, France ‘I came across a man stuck in a hole’ When exploring the northwest section of the map, I came across a man stuck in a hole along with a wagon. After venturing down the hole and speaking with him, he wanted Link to get him and his wagon out of the hole in one piece. Easy. I use a bit of flat wood, attach it to the roof of his cart, and within the hole handily are two flame emitters and two hot air balloons – it’s all coming together. I mangle the ingredients together into a decent looking contraption and ask the man to get in. He complies and I smack the vehicle, starting up the flame emitters and raising the balloons. But what I didn’t realise was the roof section was completely lopsided and as the wagon rose, it hung completely vertical and the man began to yell. The screen went black and zoomed right in, circling in on his screaming face like a Looney Tunes gag. In stitches. Game of the year. Lewis, 29, Glasgow ‘I had the day off, so I played all day’ I fortunately had a day off when it launched on Friday, so I could play all day. And on that first day I rode on the back of Farosh the electrical dragon into a chasm of gloom! Tears of the Kingdom is amazing, even better than Breath of the Wild. Being able to move around 3D so easily is so freeing, it makes real life feel not quite enough! BOTW is a phenomenal game, which I enjoy playing to its full, but TOTK takes all the good bits of BOTW and takes them to the next level (literally!) You can travel around more easily with your new powers, and the entire map is three times bigger as you can explore the sky and the depths too. In TOTK, everything is the same but different, so you get that warm, fuzzy sense of familiarity, combined with the thrill of discovering something new. And they got that balance just right. I am going cold turkey this week, as I have a big exam on Friday and lots to memorise. But I already have a plan as to what I’m going to do when I pick it up again (more shrines, cooking, side quests and exploring). And my daughter is very grateful, as she gets more time to play it. She is a big fan of collecting Poes. Emma, 43, London ‘My 11-year-old is flying through the game’ Since The Legend of Zelda II on Nes, I have since owned every mainline Zelda game day and date of release. I’ve cleared main quests in just a few days. I’ve taken time off work before. Well this time we are four days in and I haven’t even left the training area. Why? I have an 11-year-old who is already about a quarter way through the game, hogging the pro controller. I helped him through BOTW, dropped the odd hint in the Skyward sword remaster, but this time he’s solo. And he’ s flying. So for me the moment so far is seeing him run through Hyrule, forging his own way for the first time. If you want one second though it’s us both exclaiming “THE TEMPLE OF TIME!” as it was revealed. Scott Bennett, 43, Edinburgh ‘My son giggled hysterically’ Little time to play games these days, but still pre-ordered the game – it’s Zelda! My seven-year-old son had to get on and play it the second he was back from school on Friday. I came downstairs after work to find him solving a puzzle involving transporting a Korok across the sky islands. Son duly worked out how to solve the puzzle, and ferried the Korok across the chasm of sky to get to the far side. Once safely there, he picked the Korok off the platform, and hurled it over the edge of the sky island in a burst of hysterical giggles. Nic, Fife, Scotland ‘Riding my horse, Saoirse’ My favourite moment came as I was riding my horse, Saoirse. I found a bridge guarded by a three-headed, fire-breathing dragon. Going the long way around it would take too long, and I didn’t want to leave Saoirse behind. So, I charged at the dragon, hoping it would fly into the air. As I got close, it beat its wings and the wind buffeted me back. I was knocked off my horse and set on fire as I tried to stand up. As I was engulfed in flames, I noticed Saoirse could run through the gust of wind, even if I couldn’t. So I fused a rocket to my rickety shield and charged once more. When the dragon beat its wings again, I commanded Saoirse to gallop before leaping off. She skirted past the dragon, the rocket activated and shot me straight up into the air! I glided over the dragon’s heads and landed back on Saoirse’s saddle. I turned to look behind me and the dragon was barrelling down on us from the sky. Just a little further and we were off the bridge, where we managed to lose it in the nearby forest. Effie, Sheffield ‘There are some amazing easter eggs’ I love the little nods to previous games. No spoilers, but there are some amazing easter eggs calling back to storylines from earlier Zelda instalments. Little touches like this, among the awe-inspiring expanse of this game, really spark moments of joy and nostalgia. I’m still early in the game but being able to build and enhance equipment using different elements is a shift in how you engage with the game. It offers a huge array of approaches to tackling puzzles, which is an amazing experience.

Alejandro Balde and Sergi Roberto recorded messages in Spanish that were posted on the messaging service Telegram by the Russian broadcaster for La Liga with subtitles. The Spanish league has shown great support for Ukraine since the invasion by Russia in 2022 with shows of solidarity, making the decision to produce the video upsetting. “Ukrainian football club Shakhtar expresses its outrage concerning the posted video message from Barcelona players Alejandro Balde and Sergi Roberto with words of gratitude to football fans from Russia,” the Shakhtar chief executive, Sergei Palkin, said. “We hope that FC Barcelona is aware that their support of a country such as Russia at this time is completely unacceptable. We expect the club to admit its mistake and avoid similar situations in the future.” Barcelona’s Poland striker Robert Lewandowski has personally shown unity with Ukraine by wearing a captain’s armband in the country’s colours of blue and yellow, and has criticised Russia’s actions. Meanwhile, rivals Real Madrid raised more than $1m as part of their “All For Ukraine” campaign. “It is a second year of a bloody and unjustifiable military invasion by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine,” Palkin said. “Thousands of Ukrainians became victims of this war, dozens of cities were destroyed, millions of people lost their homes and became refugees. The whole world united to support Ukraine and Ukrainian people and condemned the invasion. Every day we do everything to hasten the victory of Ukraine and to protect the European values of freedom and democracy. “And then we see the players of one of the world’s top clubs, Barcelona, address the Russians, expressing their gratitude and support to them. We consider this an intolerable and simply immoral act. We must remember that no victory on the football field is worth the life of a child, no money earned in the football market is worth the destroyed cities and the wrecked lives of people.” Barcelona have been approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/colorado-river-states-california-arizona-nevada","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:15:09Z","webTitle":"US states agree breakthrough deal to prevent Colorado River from drying up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/colorado-river-states-california-arizona-nevada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/colorado-river-states-california-arizona-nevada","fields":{"headline":"US states agree breakthrough deal to prevent Colorado River from drying up","bodyText":"California, Arizona and Nevada have agreed on a plan to take less water from the drought-stricken Colorado River, a breakthrough that comes after months of fraught negotiations and several missed deadlines. The agreement, announced on Monday, proposes that in the three states, water districts, Native American tribes and farm operators cut about 13% of the total water use in the lower Colorado basin, a historic reduction that will likely trigger significant water restrictions on the region’s residents and farmland. Under the threat of more stringent water cuts by the federal government, the deal between the three lower-basin states – which claim the highest share of water resources – breaks a year-long stalemate and aims to prevent the Colorado from dwindling further, imperiling the water supplies for millions of people and vast swaths of agricultural land in the US west. Still, concerns linger that the cuts fall short of what experts believe will be necessary to sustain the system as conditions intensify in the years to come. Submitted as an alternative to federal options issued last month, the deal still must undergo an environmental analysis by the US government. Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, stressed that the announcement is not a final deal. “We agreed to a proposal. This is not an agreement,” Buschatzke said during a call with reporters. In all, the plan is expected to conserve 3m acre-feet of water over the next three years – with at least half of that amount achieved by the end of 2024. (An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons, or enough water to cover an acre of land, about the size of a football field, one foot deep and a single acre-foot is enough to sustain two average California households for a year.) Of these savings, 2.3m acre-feet will be compensated by the federal government, with $1.2bn in grant money, financed by the Inflation Reduction Act, going to cities, tribes and water districts. The rest of the savings will be worked out by the states. The agreement averts, for now, the prospect of the Biden administration imposing unilateral water cuts upon the seven states – California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming – that rely upon the river, a prospect that has loomed since last summer when the waterway’s two main reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, hit perilously low levels. Harnessing the might of the Colorado river, which rises in the Rocky Mountains and flows all the way to Mexico, has enabled cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas to flourish, as well as allowing millions of acres of agricultural land to be cultivated in otherwise harsh desert environments. More than 40 million people rely on the water the 1,450-mile (2,300km) river provides. But the enormous extraction of water, mainly for farming, coupled with the climate crisis, which has increased the evaporation of water and reduced the snowpack that feeds the river, has caused a crisis point for the river and the US west. The region is experiencing its worst drought in 1,200 years, with this year’s bumper rain and snowfall not expected to fully release the grip of a two-decade “megadrought”. Without a deal, it was feared that the water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell would fall so much that the hydroelectric turbines they powered would fail, risking the power supply to millions of people. Any further drop – Lake Mead is only about a third full and is at its lowest ebb since the construction of the Hoover dam, which created it – could see the drying up of the Colorado River south of the reservoir, which feeds the lower basin states: Nevada, California and Arizona. “Today’s announcement is a testament to the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to working with states, tribes and communities throughout the west to find consensus solutions in the face of climate change and sustained drought,” said Deb Haaland, the US interior secretary. Governors in California, Arizona and Nevada released a statement in which they hailed the breakthrough. “The lower basin plan is the product of months of tireless work by our water managers to develop an agreement that stabilizes the Colorado River system through 2026,” said Arizona’s governor, Katie Hobbs. Several large water districts have also expressed support, including the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) – California’s largest holder of rights to Colorado River water. “IID is pleased that the lower basin states have come to consensus with the development of a plan that is based on voluntary, achievable conservation volumes,” said Henry Martinez, the general manager of IID, in a statement, adding that the plan will help protect Lake Mead, from which the intensely irrigated Imperial Valley draws all of its water supply. Experts also welcomed the deal but cautioned that a longer-term solution was still badly needed. “The fact that the lower basin states and federal government came to an agreement is encouraging – it’s a significant step forward,” said Sharon Megdal, a water policy expert at the University of Arizona. “Lots of people will say 3m acre-feet isn’t enough, but this is about stopping the system from immediately crashing. Hopefully this will get us through the next few years and we can focus on what happens after 2026, because we were all worried how we would get there. Now there’s the hard work of getting a longer-term solution because this is by no means the end of the story.” Though adoption of the plan isn’t certain, Camille Touton, the commissioner of the US Bureau of Reclamation, called it an “important step forward”. Under the proposal, California – which currently received the most water based on a century-old water rights priority system – would give up about 1.6m acre-feet of water through 2026, representing a little more than half of the total. Leaders in Arizona and Nevada didn’t immediately say how they’d divide the remaining 1.4m acre feet. The upper basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming didn’t face immediate cuts, because they were not part of the pact. The proposal would buy more time for longer-term solutions, which will be needed to sustain the over-drawn basin as conditions intensify. The plan now must undergo environmental review and the federal government is expected to release a new schedule for comment later this week, with plans to finalize the process in the months to come. Michael Cohen, a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute focused on the Colorado River, called the amount of cuts the three states have proposed a “huge, huge lift” and a significant step forward. “It does buy us a little additional time,” he said. But if more dry years are ahead, “this agreement will not solve that problem.” The Associated Press contributed to this story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/22/vince-rea-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:14:49Z","webTitle":"Vince Rea obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/vince-rea-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/vince-rea-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Vince Rea obituary","bodyText":"Vince Rea, who has died aged 87, was the founder and director of the Bede gallery in Jarrow, Tyneside, through which he made an important contribution to contemporary art and to Jarrow. The gallery became nationally known through its significant British and international art exhibitions, publications, projects and commissions. Converted from a former nuclear bunker in Springwell Park, the gallery opened in 1970, and proved excellent for showing artworks. Vince and I met when I was appointed Northern Arts’ visual arts officer in 1974. Visiting the Bede was a rich experience. You never knew what to expect. Local schools were involved in projects; artists extended exhibitions with related exterior wall murals or sculptural roof installations – Two Dockyard Cranes, Neon Tower and even a representation of Van Gogh’s Bridge at Arles. An artists’ exchange was set up with Jarrow’s twinned town Wuppertal, in Germany. Vince began collecting artefacts related to Jarrow’s social and industrial past, which were put on display. This history featured in exhibitions such as Palmers Shipyard, about the yard which closed in 1933, The 50th Anniversary of the Jarrow March, 1936 and The Gibbeting of William Jobling, 1832, on Jarrow Slake. Art of the Invisible, 1977, investigated the birth of abstract art. The River Tyne exhibition was toured to social clubs and community centres. During 1978, Vince photographed street and social life, documenting people and place. Similarly, he commissioned Chris Killip to photograph Jarrow in 1996. The Bede gallery closed in 1996, and its collection was donated to Tyne &amp; Wear Museums Service. Vince then established the Viking gallery and studios in Jarrow. It was active and engaged, but struggled with no local authority financial support, and closed around 2003. Born in Jarrow, to Doris (nee Riseborough), a factory worker, and Antonio Rea, a seaman from Italy, Vince attended St Bede’s Roman Catholic school in the town. He joined the merchant navy, before undertaking national service. In the early 60s, Vince worked in marketing while also exhibiting his own paintings. Remarkably, this led to him converting the former nuclear bunker into the Bede gallery. Vince met Wilhelmina Nee, known as Willa, a local girl, in the mid-1950s, and they married in 1961. She became a dedicated co-worker. Willa died in 2022 and Vince’s older brother, Tony, died in 2009. He is survived by his younger sister, Rita."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/fretting-about-your-speed-awareness-course-suella-youre-anxious-about-the-wrong-thing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:12:27Z","webTitle":"Fretting about your speed awareness course, Suella?

You’re anxious about the wrong thing","bodyText":"My Mr and I waste a lot of argument capital circling around the probable consequences of politicians’ misdemeanours. He thinks we’re in last-days-of-Rome territory, and all it will take is a revelation that Grant Shapps yelled at a waiter and the whole thing will come down like a Jenga tower. I, conversely, think the last days of Rome went on for a long time and, in a post-Johnson world, the bar is so low for probity and whatnot that a minister would have to commit murder for the consequences to even ricochet into the next week. So I don’t think Suella Braverman has torched her own career if she did ask Whitehall officials to fix it for her to do a speed awareness course in private (although she says she did “nothing untoward”). But in the fanciful event that Mr Z is right and I am wrong, that Braverman’s trivial but telling act dispatches her to the wilderness of her party, it will have been the dumbest imaginable thing to lose a portfolio over. She could have done that course in a room full of people and nobody would have recognised her – not because she hasn’t made quite the name for herself with the frothing Nazi-lite crowdpleasers, but because the speed awareness course is a place of such pure alienation that nobody notices anyone. I’m convinced that everyone with a driving licence has done one but nobody admits it because of the shame, though not of the speeding itself, which people find pretty easy to forgive themselves for. I have only ever met one person with active penitence for going too fast, and her too fast was 90mph down Kings Road in London. For anyone unfamiliar with the Al Stewart song, this is a shopping street dense with milling people. Even then, this driver’s take-home was not “abide by the speed limit”, it was “never have an argument with your boyfriend after five margaritas, and then get in a car”. No, the course itself is crucifyingly shameful. It starts with a lecture about not looking at your phone, where you’re carefully walked through the consequences of disobeying: your course will be annulled and you’ll have to pay for another. This cycle – look at phone, get course voided, take another, look at phone – is potentially infinite. This explanation takes so long, and mentions the word “phone” so often, that all you want to do is get your phone out and play Stick Hero. Your phone becomes so magnetic that it feels like it’s glowing and yet you can’t touch it, an experience of impotence and submission that reorientates your sense of self from “person” to “worm”. It’s a lot like how I imagine a communist re-education camp. Now 19 hours have passed, but in reality, only 19 minutes. There is the whole rest of the day to fill and all the instructors have got to say is: “Don’t go so fast. Slow down.” They solicit questions, but no one has any. “Nothing? Nobody wants to know anything?” the instructors plead, and even though all they are to you is a suit, standing between you and your phone, you do still feel for them on a human level. One woman on my course felt the awkwardness so keenly that she fished up, “What about skating on the 10%? Going 77 in a 70 – doesn’t everyone do that?” “No,” the gentleman said, stern but also palpably grateful. They do have one interesting thing to say, which they save until the end of the day – and that is that however much you break the speed limit, you don’t actually arrive much sooner. You could break the law 17 times on a 100-mile journey and still only shave four minutes off it. Braverman, in other words, could camouflage effortlessly in this swamp of boredom and authoritarianism. She should have saved her sketchy use of civil servants for something more fun, like Wimbledon tickets. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/womens-champions-league-to-move-behind-dazn-paywall-next-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:03:13Z","webTitle":"Women’s Champions League to move behind Dazn paywall next season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/womens-champions-league-to-move-behind-dazn-paywall-next-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/womens-champions-league-to-move-behind-dazn-paywall-next-season","fields":{"headline":"Women’s Champions League to move behind Dazn paywall next season","bodyText":"The majority of Women’s Champions League matches will be shown behind a paywall next season, with the broadcaster Dazn believing the time is right to “accelerate the value” of the women’s game. Under Dazn’s new pay/freemium model, which was confirmed officially on Monday, 42 of the 61 games will be shown on the company’s subscription service, which costs £9.99 a month. But 19 games will remain free on YouTube – including the final, all of the quarter-finals and semi-finals and 12 from across the group stage. Dazn’s global markets chief executive, Veronica Diquattro, said the development was a crucial step in helping to enhance the financial viability of the women’s game. “We have been growing the visibility of the WCL thanks to our partnership with YouTube,” she said. “It has seen millions of streams on our Dazn platform, and also on our YouTube channel with 14 million‑plus extra viewers compared to the previous year. “But now the time is right to convert this visibility into viability and value for the long-term sustainability of the rights. Driving the commercial value upwards is how we can make sure there will be future investment in the sport for the benefit of the game and the players. And it’s also in the interest of the clubs and Uefa as well.” Dazn owns the global rights of the WCL from 2021 until 2025, and initially decided to stream all 61 games for free on its YouTube channel, which has more than 600,000 subscribers. Diquattro said she regarded the switch to a different model as the next step in the evolution of women’s football. She also hopes the majority of fans will support the move as it will allow clubs to have more money to invest in the sport and pay players what they deserve. “We have spoken to Uefa and YouTube and we are all aligned. Because we are fighting for the same results – to accelerate the value of the women’s game.” This year’s WCL final, between Barcelona and Wolfsburg, will be played on Saturday 3 June in the Philips Stadium in Eindhoven."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/we-can-t-breathe-we-can-t-see-we-can-t-hear-meet-the-real-life-merpeople-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:02:27Z","webTitle":"‘We can’t breathe!

Most have tails – but he is interested in the two women doing backflips underwater. Their colourful tails look thick and as if they might feel rubbery to touch. When one raises a hand to smile and wave, a little girl stares at her: could that actually be a mermaid? These women are part of the Circus Siren Pod, a performance group from Washington DC run by Morgana Alba, a no-nonsense, ex-military former circus performer who is its founder. She is one of the main characters in the Netflix documentary series MerPeople. It is about just that: adults who wiggle their way into mermaid tails – lube helps – to perform underwater ballet, build personal brands and meet fellow obsessives. The show zips around the US between mermaid performers trying to establish professional careers, business owners looking to grow “mer” empires and veteran mermaids who, decades on, still can’t get enough of deep-water diving. The effect is somewhere between endearing and nerdy as the mers throw around pun-filled terminology (“shello!” is a common greeting) and refer to each other strictly by their mermaid titles. From the start, MerPeople dispels the idea that mermaiding is easy. As Alba says:“It’s one of the most physically uncomfortable situations you can ever be in. You can’t breathe. You can’t see. You can’t really hear. You’re probably cold. And the tail is dragging you down.” On a basic human level, “our bodies don’t want to be under those conditions”. Yet she and her “pod” (yes, like dolphins) endure it anyway. It is the only way to delight their fans. Mermaid performance has always been hard. The series takes you back to a mermaid show that began in 1947, at Weeki Wachee Springs in Florida. Barbara Wynns, now in her 70s, started working there after secondary school, after watching the balletic mermaid show at 13. “We were all teenagers, in the woods and 15 miles from anywhere,” she says. There were strict rules for the performers. “One girl got fired because her boyfriend streaked,” she says. Wynns was fired for co-hosting a party in her cottage where a brawl broke out (“a bunch of drunk teenage boys”). They re-hired her a couple of years later after she “grovelled back”. Wynns and her colleagues had to dive up to 15 metres (50ft) underwater in the springs, breathing through a thin air hose and hoping the pressure wouldn’t blow the blood vessels in their heads. Nose and ear infections were rife. But, as with everyone else, Wynns loved performing so much that she put up with the difficulties. “It’s in our blood. I know we sound neurotic, but there’s no place like it.” The Weeki Wachee performers often wore diving fins rather than tails, so were more like a cross between divers and dancers. “We were like the Rockettes,” Wynns says. Back then, mers tended to look a certain way: white, slim, all women. Or, as Alba puts it: “There was a very homogeneous mould of who could be a mermaid performer.” That is changing. Chè Monique’s website bills her as a “fat, Black mermaid with natural hair”. As the founder of the Society of Fat Mermaids, she considers the word fat a neutral descriptor, not an insult or a source of shame. “When I first started looking for tails, it was definitely hard to find anything bigger than an XL. I was a 3XL when I started and I’m a 4XL now,” she says, speaking while pulling herself away from the action at the California Mermaid Convention. “I’ve definitely seen ads posted for jobs where you need to have a certain waist size.” Alba agrees, insisting the mermaid community is pushing back against its reputation as a home only for performers who closely resemble The Little Mermaid’s original, animated Ariel: “Now, we’re saying anyone can be a mermaid, at any ability level, of any body shape, any size, any background.” In fact, Monique remembers being on a panel at a convention with Alba “and saying to her: ‘Yeah, I need to see some more fat fish in your tank. Or just any,’” referring to the Circus Siren Pod. Monique’s society makes and sells T-shirts featuring Black plus-size mermaids, and promotes the work of similar-looking performers online. As with all other parts of society, mermaids are reckoning with lingering biases and norms. But that makes MerPeople sound worthy. Rather, it plucks at the heartstrings while educating. There is no gentle way to ease viewers into the level of commitment mers apply to their passion. One aspiring non-binary performer, the Blixunami, genuinely believes they are from mermaid stock, due to a family story about their great-great-grandfather encountering a mermaid on a South Carolina beach and nursing her back to health. Eric DuCharme, a performer and tail-maker known as the Mertailor, comes across as so singularly focused that nothing matters other than the mer world. When he auditions divers in his custom-built performance aquarium, he looks at them with the furrowed brow of an engineer overseeing a rocket launch. Like Wynns, DuCharme first encountered mermaids at Weeki Wachee springs, at four, and was hooked. By about eight, he was making his own tails, befriending Wynns and other mermaids working at the time. “I was a very to-myself child,” he says, focusing his attention on learning to sew tails and dreaming of one day performing at Weeki Wachee. As a queer boy with Tourette syndrome, mermaiding was a refuge. “I went to school because I had to. But my free time was devoted to drawing mermaid tails, trying to figure out how to open my own aquarium and things like that.” By 15, he was being interviewed by state newspapers about his tail-making business; at 16, he was hired to perform at Weeki Wachee. Now in his early 30s, DuCharme has accomplished everything he set out to do, including making a tail worn by Lady Gaga and several custom tails for retired Weeki Wachee mermaids. “The child back then would have patted this version of myself on the back in congratulation,” he says. Sceptics may not understand what drives mers to invest so much money and time in their intricate costumes, or to suspend their disbelief in mermaids overall. “I am very protective of my mermaids, especially from vitriol online,” says Alba. “There are always going to be people who don’t understand why someone became a mermaid.” This is a community a bit like historical re-enactors: if you get it, you get it – and you are probably devoted. Everyone I speak to mentions the word freedom. “Mermaiding just feels right,” says Monique. “It’s taken over my life, my family’s life – it just feels like what I’m supposed to be doing.” For DuCharme, “there’s nothing more special than to be underwater, in what feels like zero gravity, and able to move your arms, legs, feet. It’s a sense of tranquillity, like a meditative state.” At its core, the performance side of mermaiding is about having an excellent swim, throwing in a touch of fantasy and making like-minded friends. MerPeople tempers the emotional climaxes with melancholy (and a few cringeworthy moments). Whether it converts people to the community remains to be seen. What is Alba’s hope for the TV series? “If it means I never have to explain what ‘professional mermaid’ means at another cocktail party, I’ll be thrilled.” • MerPeople is on Netflix from 23 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/22/rural-life-written-out-cobra-farmers-delhi-gauri-gill-on-photographing-indias-forgotten-people","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:01:19Z","webTitle":"‘Rural life is being written out’: Gauri Gill on photographing India’s forgotten people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/rural-life-written-out-cobra-farmers-delhi-gauri-gill-on-photographing-indias-forgotten-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/rural-life-written-out-cobra-farmers-delhi-gauri-gill-on-photographing-indias-forgotten-people","fields":{"headline":"‘Rural life is being written out’: Gauri Gill on photographing India’s forgotten people","bodyText":"Gauri Gill started out in her 20s, a Delhi-based photojournalist covering stories right across India. She’d drop in, drop back out, then later find herself wondering what had happened to all the people she had photographed. “In India, as across the world,” says Gill, “the rural is being written out. The city – and AI is an extreme extension of the city – leads us to think we can do everything through machines. But the actual people on the ground – the farmers, the peasants, the Adivasis [the term given to India’s indigenous peoples], the forest-dwellers, who have lived so beautifully and so sustainably on the earth and from whom we should be learning – are being crushed.” In 1999, Gill saw a young girl being beaten by her teacher at a school near Jodhpur and decided this was something she needed to spend longer on. She pitched a story on village schools. When no commission came, Gill quit her job at a magazine and made her way back to the farthest reaches of Rajasthan, to the Thar desert. She wanted to record what life there was like, especially for women and girls. She could not look away. This marked the beginning of a photographic archive, now in its third decade, that Gill calls Notes from the Desert. For a long time, she showed the photographs only to the people in them, now her friends. She worried about “people with power going in and representing people without power”. But one day, she spoke to a great activist who had long worked in these areas. He said: “Don’t you think rich people have hearts?” Taking her work only to the relevant villages, he added, could not be as impactful as taking it farther afield, to Delhi and Mumbai, say. After all, the villagers already knew their stories. In 2020, again, Gill could not look away when farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and beyond – fearing the government’s agricultural reforms would further imperil their already fragile livelihoods by giving greater power to global corporations – travelled in convoys of tractors and trucks to protest in Delhi. They drove up to the police barricades on the roads leading into the capital and made camp. Did Gill grab her camera? Actually, Gill’s archive does not document the year-long protest that followed. There were activists living there throughout, she says, who were doing an amazing job of getting the message out. Instead, she first visited in January, two months in, merely to show her support. It was freezing cold. There were neither proper toilets nor running water. Why is it, she wondered, that the voices of the people who are actually growing our food are not heard? So Gill chose to document the village the farmers built, especially the way they adapted their farm vehicles to make them habitable during extreme weather. This series is called The Village on the Highway and it is one of the many pictorial treasures heralding the completion of the new Photography Centre at the V&amp;A in London, which opens to the public on 25 May. Spread across seven galleries, the centre chronicles photography from its very beginnings to the present day, aiming to “explore its extensive impact on our lives”. Gill works with a big film camera. It is a slow, almost painterly medium that lends itself to capturing margins and details, things quiet and overlooked. The farmers had brought flags, produce, patience and the sort of resolve that comes from a lifetime of working fields. They had also brought their own knowledge systems and skills – including the make-do ethos called jugaad. They stretched out tarpaulin and trussed it up to metal, taped mesh to door frames and erected tents and bamboo scaffolding, to carve out spaces to eat and rest in. For all their endeavours, though, the people are absent from these shots, which just feature what Gill calls these “speaking structures”. The villagers also set up kitchens boasting brick-cased fires and cooking pots the size of bathtubs, from which they fed not just each other but also the people – some of the city’s poorest – already living where they now camped. Gill photographed cauliflower plants one farmer had planted in the roadside dirt. “We will grow produce right here and show them!” he told her. Twelve months later, as the laws were finally repealed and the farmers started packing up to go home, Gill watched a local woman cry. She had come to the site to be fed every day. “In the face of extreme hard-heartedness, the farmers were saying, ‘Here we will give you food. We will be generous.’ That spirit and quality is what moved me. When you were there with them, you didn’t feel like leaving. Even at the very low points, people would say, ‘It’s OK, we will win, we will just keep sitting here.’ It was so optimistic.” Many of the farmers were elderly men, who as Gill puts it, “brought their bodies” to the year-long struggle. Some estimates put the number of those who died as a result at 750. “One man said to me, ‘If you want to see Guru Nanak [the 15th-century founder of Sikhism] come and see the old men over here.’ It would break my heart because they were in the last stages of sitting there, giving themselves, fighting not just for themselves but for all of us. Their survival is key to all of us.” Scroll through The Village on the Highway section of Gill’s archive and it’s the details that capture the eye: Buddhist prayer flags, red Communist flags, the Indian national flag, Sikh religious flags, farmers’ association flags. Then there are the garlands of plastic flowers, the rusting corrugated iron sheets jostling with unhitched trailers and large water tanks. Straw is stuffed beneath tarpaulin-covered roofs, for extra insulation against cold air and monsoon rains. Shoes, flicked off tired feet, mark the entrance to a living space decorated with muddy rugs. Gill calls the site “an architecture of resistance and tremendous beauty, because you see how it comes from urgent necessity”. This combination of resistance and beauty can be found in another ongoing series, Traces. Begun in 1999, it records the graves created in the Thar desert by Muslims, Hindus, nomadic Jogis and Bishnoi alike. To an outsider, these slight mounds, subtly signalled by a grouping of stones or crockery shards, might appear merely incidental to the rocky terrain. But the people who live there know – and, crucially, Gill knows the people. When Gill talks about her projects, she says “we”. So does she work with a big team? “No,” she replies. “I’m alone, pretty much.” In Delhi, she has a studio manager to help with admin, but when she’s working elsewhere, it’s just her and her camera and the people she’s visiting. She speaks with them in Hindi, Punjabi, English and Hindustani (the lingua franca that mixes Urdu and Hindi). Mostly, though she tries to get out of the way and listen. People might ask her to go to the police station with them when they’re in trouble, or accompany them to the hospital if doctors aren’t taking them seriously. As an English-speaker, says the photographer, she has a power people can tap into. “The world of English,” she says, “is the world that is seen to be the centre, the norm. But there are many, many, many other worlds.” In Acts of Appearance, begun in 2015, Gill collaborated with papier-mache artists in a village in Maharashtra. For the annual Bohada festival, sculptors from the Adivasi communities of the Kokna and Warli tribes create extraordinary lacquered masks depicting the deities, which the villagers wear in re-enactments of myths that last several nights. Struck by how removed such a visual universe was from the day-to-day challenges the people face, she commissioned the artists to make masks of the animals and objects they treasured most, then photographed everyone wearing them. The result is extraordinary, like a people’s mythology. Animals are a natural and symbiotic part of the Adivasi universe. We see two women, one a clock face, the other a lizard, peering out of a bashed white transit van. Elsewhere, three people with the heads of a camel, a donkey and a goat sit cross-legged at a carrom board. A hare-headed girl crouches in a cotton tent. Although no glimpse is given of the people behind the masks, Gill feels very much in their debt. “You see the name Gauri Gill on these works,” says the photographer, “but so many other people make them possible.” Gill loves how the mask series has taken on a life of its own. She recently stood in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, during a major retrospective of her work, marvelling at the conviction with which some visitors, not knowing who she was, were explaining her photographs to others. With a laugh, she says: “They really seemed to own the work!” The V&amp;A Photography Centre opens on 25 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/how-big-a-deal-is-us-and-australian-co-operation-on-climate-and-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:39Z","webTitle":"How big a deal is US and Australian cooperation on climate and energy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/how-big-a-deal-is-us-and-australian-co-operation-on-climate-and-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/how-big-a-deal-is-us-and-australian-co-operation-on-climate-and-energy","fields":{"headline":"How big a deal is US and Australian cooperation on climate and energy?","bodyText":"Joe Biden and Anthony Albanese say climate and clean energy will become a “central pillar” of the alliance between the US and Australia – and they will ramp up cooperation on critical minerals. Beyond the flashy headlines, what does this mean? What have the two countries announced? After a meeting on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, over the weekend, the US president and the Australian prime minister said they both recognised “the importance of addressing the climate crisis as a critical component of the bilateral relationship”. They said climate and clean energy should be seen as “the third pillar of the alliance, alongside our defence and economic cooperation”. What message are they trying to send? Michael Green, the chief executive officer of the US Studies Centre and a former senior US official, says the bilateral meeting was a chance for Biden and Albanese to speak more broadly to their own constituencies “than they were able to with the Quad and the Aukus summits and to focus on something that’s personally important to both of them that their predecessors did not focus on”. Green notes that polling commissioned by the United States Studies Centre shows support for the US alliance “is pretty robust among Australians, but Australians in their 20s by large numbers said they want to see more action on climate in the relationship”. OK, but is there any substance to this lofty rhetoric? Well, Biden and Albanese flagged a series of steps to “elevate global climate ambition, accelerate the global clean energy transition, and support mitigation, adaptation and resilience efforts in the Indo-Pacific and beyond”. This includes signing a statement of intent to advance climate cooperation through the Australia-United States climate, critical minerals and clean energy transformation compact. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But at this stage, a lot of the work is yet to be fleshed out. A series of working groups are being set up, including a ministerial-level taskforce on critical minerals. Another grouping will “develop a new action plan by the end of 2023 to encourage stronger industrial collaboration and accelerate progress towards our ambitious climate goals”. Will Australia be eligible for grants or incentives under the US Inflation Reduction Act? Possibly, but this is yet to be put into practice. Albanese told reporters on Sunday that “the big risk with the Inflation Reduction Act … is that you’ll see capital leaves Australia to go to the United States” – but he said the new measures were “about addressing that”. Green explains that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is “full of contradictions” between the imperative for international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions “versus the ‘made in America’ rent-seeking aspects”. “Australia, like other allies, is very worried about the latter,” Green says, arguing the announcement sends a message to the markets that Australia should not be disadvantaged. “It’s a strong political signal that since the president and the administration have a lot of latitude in implementing the IRA, that Australia has an open door to come in and say how it should be implemented.” Green thinks Australian companies may have opportunities to apply for tax credits or grants, but this may well be a case-by-case situation. “So the Australian embassy and ambassador Kevin Rudd are going to have to be on their toes – and Australian companies are going to have to be paying attention – to make sure that when there are subsidies or tax rebates or other incentives, it doesn’t force companies to make a decision not to invest in Australia.” Are Australia and the US doing enough on the climate crisis? No. The Climate Action Tracker, an independent analysis tool, rates the US and Australia’s climate targets and policies as “insufficient”. The analysis of Australia’s policies says the Albanese government’s stronger 2030 targets have improved the country’s overall rating from “highly insufficient” to “insufficient”. But it warns: “Under Australia’s current policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 3C warming if all other countries followed a similar level of ambition.” The Climate Action Tracker’s analysis of the US says the Inflation Reduction Act signed by Biden in August 2022 is “the most ambitious and potentially impactful climate policy in US history”, but adds that “the totality of the US policies and proposals need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris agreement’s 1.5C temperature limit and are not consistent with any interpretation of a fair-share contribution”. Have the leaders made any further progress on Aukus? Biden promised to ask the US Congress to add Australia as a “domestic source” within the meaning of title III of the Defense Production Act – a designation that is already afforded to Canada. According to both governments, this move would “streamline technological and industrial base collaboration, accelerate and strengthen Aukus implementation, and build new opportunities for United States investment in the production and purchase of Australian critical minerals, critical technologies and other strategic sectors”. Green predicts Congress will be supportive of the move, but it is part of a bigger picture to update export controls to improve the sharing of tech under the Aukus security partnership. “The clear message I heard, when I was in Washington two weeks ago, from Congress and from across the administration is there’s a political consensus to carve out big exceptions for Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/i-bought-my-first-australian-home-aged-26-how-a-combination-of-privilege-and-inheritance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:39Z","webTitle":"I bought my first home in Australia aged 26.

How? A combination of privilege and inheritance","bodyText":"“I’m basically just waiting for my parents to die,” says Gemma. She is not wishing death on anyone, just realistic about her ability to buy a house, and inheritance may be her only option. Gemma is a single 36-year-old living in Adelaide on a modest salary, and the money she has saved won’t be enough to secure her a deposit on a property anywhere nearby. Even with the support of the 5% deposit scheme, rising house prices and high interest rates mean mortgage repayments would be unmanageable. Despite facing similar challenges, in 2021, aged 26, I bought my first home. How? A combination of privilege and unfortunate circumstances. The deaths of my father and grandfather left me, an only child, with an inheritance sufficient for a house deposit. Additionally, my husband comes from a middle-class background and thanks to a mum-funded scheme, managed to renovate two houses for profit. With our money combined, we had a 20% deposit for a $555,000 house and money left over to renovate. In Adelaide, this bought us a three-bedroom 60s house on almost 700 sq metres of land. We bought our house in what would kindly be described as an “up-and-coming” suburb, yet two years later there is nothing similar available for the price we paid. To buy a house as an average young Australian you need privilege and parental support or inheritance. A recent survey showed 72% of 18- to 34-year-old Australians feel they will never be able to buy a house. A 2023 report by the University of Sydney revealed that 25- to 34-year-olds who enter the property market, usually do so with considerable family support, whether financial (monetary gifts or inheritance) or in-kind (rent-free accommodation, daily expenses paid for, parents acting as guarantors, etc). The ANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett said, “whether you’re able to buy a home and become a first-homeowner increasingly depends on what sort of job your mum and dad had, and I suppose the question is, ‘Is that really, as a society, what we want?’” Sallie, a 38-year-old publicist, bought her Melbourne apartment in 2017, aged 33, using a payout from her mum’s life insurance. She says, “There is no way I could have afforded to buy the place without that life insurance money, and my borrowing capacity still wasn’t great because of the low-paying industry in which I work.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Lucy, a 29-year-old emergency call-taker and musician, bought her first home in Geelong last year. To save for a 15% deposit, Lucy lived rent-free in her parent’s home for three years. Even with this initial support, she finds meeting her rising mortgage payments difficult – in the eight months since buying, her mortgage has increased by $208 a week. Lucy describes 2023 as the most difficult year of her life, “I’m working overtime every week, selling my possessions, and cutting back on all non-essentials to pay my mortgage and bills.” Young people don’t lack the motivation or financial skills to buy a house, they simply lack the money. Research suggests the increases in house prices and cost of living have made home ownership increasingly challenging, with low-income households “unable to keep pace with market changes through their saving and budgeting strategies”. The hill is only getting steeper and young people’s ability to climb it is hugely dependent on their circumstances. In 2021, Australian property values rose almost 10 times faster than wages. In 2001, median house prices were just 4.5 times median wages, but in 2022 house prices were 8.5 times median wages. The time it takes to save a deposit is at a national high, with ANZ estimating the average Australian household saves for more than 11 years to reach a 20% deposit (make that 14 years if you’re in Sydney). Saving for a deposit on a single income is almost impossible … but not according to some banks. In a vain attempt to make home ownership look achievable, NAB shares some infuriatingly unhelpful tips for a single person earning $60,000 to save a deposit in only two to three years. They just need to sell their car, move back home and find a $300,000 flat within a reasonable commute to the CBD. Simple! I didn’t post about buying my home on social media. Sharing the news without an explanation of the funds felt misleading, wrongly implying that two young arts professionals could easily buy a large home. They couldn’t. I’m telling the truth now so those who are struggling to enter the market have some perspective. But it does nothing to help them buy, or even to secure (and hold on to) a decent rental in this precarious housing market. I don’t know any young Australians on average salaries who have completely self-funded their property purchases, and those I spoke to reiterate this sentiment. So, when I see a young person buy their first home, I wonder, “Are your parents rich or dead?” • Nicole McKenzie is a freelance writer based in Adelaide"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/scientists-discover-brain-signals-for-chronic-pain","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:39Z","webTitle":"Scientists discover brain signals for chronic pain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/scientists-discover-brain-signals-for-chronic-pain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/scientists-discover-brain-signals-for-chronic-pain","fields":{"headline":"Scientists discover brain signals for chronic pain","bodyText":"Brain signals that reveal how much pain a person is in have been discovered by scientists who say the work is a step towards radical new treatments for people living with debilitating chronic pain. It is the first time researchers have decoded the brain activity underlying chronic pain in patients, raising hopes that brain stimulation therapies already used for Parkinson’s and major depression can help those who have run out of other options. “What we’ve learned is that chronic pain can successfully be tracked and predicted in the real world, while patients are walking the dog, or at home, when they get up in the morning, and when they are going about their lives,” said Prasad Shirvalkar, a neurologist and lead researcher on the project at the University of California, San Francisco. A “silent epidemic” of chronic pain affects nearly 28 million adults in the UK alone, meaning nearly 44% of the population have experienced pain for at least three months despite medication or treatment. The causes are manifold, ranging from arthritis, cancer and back problems to diabetes, stroke and endometriosis. But while chronic pain has fuelled a rise in prescriptions of powerful opioids, no medical treatments work well for the condition, prompting experts to call for a complete rethink in how health services handle patients with lasting pain. For the latest study, published in Nature Neuroscience, Shirvalkar and his colleagues surgically implanted electrodes into four patients with intractable chronic pain after a stroke or the loss of a limb. The devices allowed the patients to record activity in two brain regions – the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) – at the press of a button on a remote handset. Several times a day, the volunteers were asked to complete short surveys on the strength and type of pain they were experiencing, and then record snapshots of their brain activity. Armed with the survey responses and brain recordings, the scientists found they could train an algorithm to predict a person’s pain based on the electrical signals in their OFC. “We’ve developed an objective biomarker for that type of pain,” said Shirvalkar. Separate work by the team found that very different brain activity accompanied acute or short-term pain, such as that produced by a hot object touching the skin. The finding may explain, at least in part, why routine painkillers are less effective for chronic pain than the short stab of agony from a stubbed toe. “Chronic pain is not just a more enduring version of acute pain, it is fundamentally different in the brain,” Shirvalkar said. “The hope is, as we understand this better, that we can use the information to develop personalised brain stimulation therapies for the most severe forms of pain.” The findings could have an immediate impact on clinical trials that are investigating a procedure called deep brain stimulation to control chronic pain. Deep brain stimulation sends electrical pulses into the brain to disrupt problematic signals. Because it involves brain surgery, DBS is a treatment of last resort, but it is already used for Parkinson’s disease and major depressive disorder. To be effective, doctors need to know precisely which signals to target. Prof Blair Smith, an expert in chronic pain at the University of Dundee who was not involved in the research, said the lack of objective measures for pain make it difficult for doctors to assess whether treatments are effective. “If this research is successfully extended, it offers not only the opportunity to develop objective measurement of some types of pain, but also to enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms,” he said. But pain is a complex phenomenon, Smith warned, with psychological, social and cultural factors, previous experiences of pain and expectations all feeding in. “As [the essayist] Nassim Taleb wrote: ‘studying neurobiology to understand humans is like studying ink to understand literature.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/at-the-brink-how-international-students-in-australia-are-ending-up-homeless-and-hungry","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘At the brink’: international students in Australia are ending up homeless and hungry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/at-the-brink-how-international-students-in-australia-are-ending-up-homeless-and-hungry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/at-the-brink-how-international-students-in-australia-are-ending-up-homeless-and-hungry","fields":{"headline":"‘At the brink’: international students in Australia are ending up homeless and hungry","bodyText":"When Juliën Lubeek received a scholarship to complete his PhD at a prestigious Australian institution, he didn’t expect to be homeless and living through a pandemic. After Covid delays forced him to extend his submission date at the end of 2021, his scholarship of $1,128 a fortnight ran out. For the next eight months, the international student experienced bouts of homelessness and of being unable to afford rent or food. International students could not access government support during the pandemic but were allowed to work up to 40 hours a week. But Lubeek said working this much was “impossible” while studying full-time. “Although I had a casual job, this wasn’t enough [to] cover rent, living expenses, transportation, overseas health insurance, medication, food,” he said. “International students are considered cash cows, not humans.” International students are going hungry at an alarming rate and more support is needed to help them manage while in Australia, new research has found. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Monash University report, provided exclusively to Guardian Australia, surveyed more than 60 international students in Melbourne last year and found they were being burdened by the rising cost of living, prohibitive transport costs and the difficulty of juggling study and work commitments. There are 182,000 international students currently living in Melbourne, representing almost 40% of Victoria’s entire university population. The report found almost half those surveyed experienced food insecurity – triple the rate of the wider population. About 12% of Australians experience moderate or severe food insecurity, which occurs when individuals can’t access sufficient nutritious and culturally appropriate food. The rate rises to around a quarter for those under 25. Co-author of the report Dr Beatriz Gallo Cordoba said she was shocked by how “at the brink” of hardship the interviewees were, often surrounded by stigma that forced them to struggle silently, leading to lower academic performance and wellbeing. “They’d say ‘I’m OK’, and if you dug deeper, they were working different jobs, [and] lived in accommodation they didn’t like or they couldn’t afford to pay,” she said. She said international students needed more support, including with food relief, financial support, vouchers or scholarships. “We need to make sure links between communities and students are built faster … where to go to find food, different jobs, [the] feeling of having a community,” she said. “It’s a story of struggle when you first arrive, we want to avoid that experience. Universities have a responsibility of care to try to build those connections, but they can’t do it alone.” Co-author professor Lucas Walsh said many students had to implement coping strategies to get by. One 27-year-old male student who was surveyed said he didn’t choose what to eat – his wallet chose for him. “When a crisis like Covid-19 or the cost-of-living crisis hits, many of these strategies stop working,” Walsh said. “It’s not just in health terms, it can mean [a] sense of belonging, connection back home, something that can be fostered and nurtured. “[International students are] silent communities that fly beneath [the] radar and we need to pay more attention. We need to embrace the idea we’re welcoming them.” Another student, a 25-year-old female, said her relationship with food had changed since arriving in Australia and was “directly showing on [her] body and energy levels”. The Greens spokesperson for education, senator Mehreen Faruqi, said Australia was “failing” international students through the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis. “It’s a disgrace governments and universities treat international students like cash cows, enticing them to come to our shores but then leaving them high and dry during tough times,” she said. With “sky-high rents” and a cost-of-living crisis, Walsh said it was unlikely the situation would improve in the short term. “International students were a hugely vulnerable population during the pandemic – and there’s wider research its effects will have a long tail,” he said. “The pandemic is not over.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/the-great-victorian-budget-mystery-who-will-repay-its-massive-covid-debt","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"The great Victorian budget mystery: who will repay its massive ‘Covid debt’?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/the-great-victorian-budget-mystery-who-will-repay-its-massive-covid-debt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/the-great-victorian-budget-mystery-who-will-repay-its-massive-covid-debt","fields":{"headline":"The great Victorian budget mystery: who will repay its massive ‘Covid debt’?","bodyText":"It’s a time-honoured tradition the day before any budget: the treasurer poses for TV crews and photographers with the document they spent months preparing. Sometimes, treasurers are a little awkward in front of the cameras. Often, they are coy. But they almost always crack the same joke – that people will have to wait just one more day to find out what’s inside the budget. Yet most of the time, political tragics and policy wonks usually already know what’s included, thanks to a steady stream of pre-budget announcements and picture opportunities. For the eight years the Victorian Labor government has followed this tried and tested formula. But ahead of treasurer Tim Pallas’ ninth budget on Tuesday, its approach has been noticeably different. While Pallas agreed to pose for images with the document, there has been no significant pre-budget announcement. The post-budget drinks for Labor MPs are cancelled, to avoid them being seen as celebrating what many have privately described as a “horror” budget. Late on Monday, the government released some statistics: a predicted $1bn surplus in 2025/26, an improvement on the $900m forecast in the pre-election update in November; and another $1.2bn surplus the following financial year. But the government did not confirm the figures for the 2023/24 or 2024/25 financial years (deficits were forecast for both years in November) or release information regarding the state’s total debt. Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, considered a master communicator by those who love or loathe him, has also been very intentional with his framing of the budget. He has repeatedly described it as “tough”, “difficult”, “challenging” and “painful” – and publicly blames the pandemic and the Reserve Bank. Andrews recently said the government had to borrow billions to save lives, support businesses and keep people in jobs during Covid-19 lockdowns. He said it did so at the direction of the Reserve Bank governor, Phillip Lowe, who he claims briefed national cabinet that Australia could face a 25% unemployment rate if it didn’t. According to Andrews, the federal, state and territory governments were told interest rates wouldn’t be going up anytime soon. Instead, the bank has increased the official cash rate 11 times in 12 months. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The premier’s comments that interest rate rises were “smashing families” and not effectively fighting inflation has likely resonated with many Victorians struggling with increasing mortgage repayments and the cost-of-living crisis. But the comments fail to take into account that in June 2019 – before the pandemic – Victoria already had accrued debt totalling $25.4bn, or 5.5% of the state economy. At the time, debt was forecast to rise to $54.9bn by 2022/23. This was due to a huge infrastructure agenda that included level-crossing removals, Melbourne Airport Rail and the North East Link. Major projects were since hit – due to factors not limited to Covid – by skills shortages and increased costs for materials. With the federal government reviewing its infrastructure commitments in light of these pressures, the infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, last week announced a pause on the next stage of works on several projects, including the multibillion-dollar airport rail link. Adding in the Covid borrowings, Victoria’s debt is now forecast to surge from $116bn in 2022/23 to $166bn by 2025/26, according to Treasury’s pre-election budget update, equivalent to 26.5% of the state’s economy. By 2025/26, interest payments on state debt was forecast to total $7.5bn. These figures are unlikely to improve in Tuesday’s budget. Last week, Andrews sought to differentiate between “economy-growing” debt and borrowings during Covid: he likened the former to a mortgage; the latter, a credit card. “Covid debt’s a bit more like a credit card, and we have to get that balance back down to zero,” Andrews said. It’s not yet known how the government plans to pay the debt down, but it’s expected there will be a combination of savings, including by cutting the public service, and new revenue measures. Allan, who rebuffed more than a dozen budget-related questions at a press conference on Monday, said measures to pay down the Covid debt would not impact families. “This will not be something placed on hardworking families who’ve already gone through a really difficult 12 months with 11 interest rate rises,” she said. The big question is: who will end up paying for it?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/affordable-rental-properties-in-australian-capital-cities-at-record-low","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"Affordable rental properties in Australian capital cities at ‘record low’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/affordable-rental-properties-in-australian-capital-cities-at-record-low","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/affordable-rental-properties-in-australian-capital-cities-at-record-low","fields":{"headline":"Affordable rental properties in Australian capital cities at ‘record low’","bodyText":"The number of properties listed for under $400 per week has halved in the last year, new data from PropTrack shows.

The proportion of rental properties available for under $400 per week is at its lowest level on record for all Australian capital cities except Hobart and Darwin.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Three years ago, in March 2020, 42% of houses were listed for under $400 a week, PropTrack senior economist Eleanor Creagh said. “We’ve got a persistent shortage of rentals in the private rental market and that is giving landlords the scope to continue to lift rents,” Creagh said. “So we’re seeing that share of affordable rental properties declining.” Units have had the sharpest decline in affordability, with the percentage available for under $400 per week falling from 35.6% to 19.8% in the 12 months to April. Just 12.6% of available houses were listed for $400 or less per week. Creagh said surging rents had already outpaced the increase to commonwealth rent assistance. The maximum rate of commonwealth rent assistance will increase by 15% from 20 September, according to measures outlined in this month’s budget. “Conditions remain very, very challenging, particularly for low-income Australians,” Creagh said. “Low-income households looking for a rental will find it very tough to avoid spending a large share of their income on rent. “But with advertised rents continuing to climb and the share of affordable rental listings falling, any households looking for a rental at the moment will find it tough to avoid spending more of their income on rent.” The market is expected to continue to tighten, with the current median national rent sitting at $530 for houses and $485 for units. Creagh said there was little relief in sight for renters. “We know strong migration, low vacancy rates and limited new supply probably means that tough conditions for renters are going to continue,” Creagh said. “The only sustainable solution to the rental crisis is an increase in the supply of available rentals. That takes time – and there isn’t anything on the immediate horizon to address the shortage of rental properties.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/global-heating-human-climate-niche","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"Global heating will push billions outside ‘human climate niche’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/global-heating-human-climate-niche","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/global-heating-human-climate-niche","fields":{"headline":"Global heating will push billions outside ‘human climate niche’","bodyText":"Global heating will drive billions of people out of the “climate niche” in which humanity has flourished for millennia, a study has estimated, exposing them to unprecedented temperatures and extreme weather. The world is on track for 2.7C of heating with current action plans and this would mean 2 billion people experiencing average annual temperatures above 29C by 2030, a level at which very few communities have lived in the past. Up to 1 billion people could choose to migrate to cooler places, the scientists said, although those areas remaining within the climate niche would still experience more frequent heatwaves and droughts. However, urgent action to lower carbon emissions and keep global temperature rise to 1.5C would cut the number of people pushed outside the climate niche by 80%, to 400 million. The analysis is the first of its kind and is able to treat every citizen equally, unlike previous economic assessments of the damage of the climate crisis, which have been skewed towards the rich. In countries with large populations and already warm climates most people will be pushed outside the human climate niche, with India and Nigeria facing the worst changes. India is already suffering from extreme heatwaves, and a recent study found that more than a third of heat-related deaths in summer from 1991-2018 occurred as a direct result of human-caused global heating. Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, UK, who led the new research, said: “The costs of global warming are often expressed in financial terms but our study highlights the phenomenal human cost of failing to tackle the climate emergency. “Economic estimates almost always value the rich more than the poor, because they have more assets to lose, and they tend to value those alive now over those living in the future. We’re considering all people as equal in this study.” Prof Chi Xu, at Nanjing University in China, and also part of the research team, said: “Such high temperatures [outside the niche] have been linked to issues including increased mortality, decreased labour productivity, decreased cognitive performance, impaired learning, adverse pregnancy outcomes, decreased crop yield, increased conflict and infectious disease spread.” Prof Marten Scheffer at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, and a senior author of the study, said those pushed outside the climate niche might consider migrating to cooler places: “Not just migration of tens of millions of people but it might be a billion or so.” The idea of climate niches for wild animals and plants is well established but the new study, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, identified the climate conditions in which human societies have thrived. It found most people lived in places with mean annual temperatures spread around 13C or 25C. Conditions outside those are too hot, too cold or too dry and associated with higher death rates, lower food production and lower economic growth. “The climate niche describes where people flourish and have flourished for centuries, if not millennia in the past,” Lenton said. “When people are outside [the niche], they don’t flourish.” Scheffer said: “We were surprised how sharply limited humans have remained when it comes to their distribution relative to climate – this is a fundamental thing we’ve put our finger on.” The scientists then used climate and population models to examine likely future changes in the number of people outside the climate niche, which they defined as above an annual average temperature of 29C. There are 60 million people living outside the niche and exposed to dangerous heat, the researchers said. But with each rise of 0.1C in global temperature above the 1.2C of human-caused global heating already seen today, an extra 140 million people are driven outside the niche. If global temperature continues to rise towards 2.7C, the heating combined with a growing global population will mean 2 billion people living outside the niche by 2030 and 3.7 billion by 2090. In a worst-case scenario, with the climate more sensitive to greenhouse gas rises than expected, global temperature would rise of 3.6C and leave almost half of the world’s population outside the climate niche. Rapid and deep cuts to emissions to keep heating to 1.5C would hugely reduce the number of people outside the niche, the researchers found. For example, 90 million people in India would live with an average temperature above 29C, compared with 600 million if global temperature rose to 2.7C. Other countries that would be severely affected by high temperatures include Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan. Lenton said the study emphasised the “huge inequality” of the climate emergency with those people with low emissions suffering the greatest changes in extreme heat exposure. He said the most practical and immediate option to adapt to high temperatures was to increase green spaces in cities: “This can shave 5C off extreme temperatures and provide shade – that’s huge.” Dr Richard Klein, at the Stockholm Environment Institute in Sweden, and not part of the team, said: “What this study shows very well is the direct human suffering that climate change could cause – living outside the niche means suffering due to an unbearably hot and possibly humid climate. Dr Laurence Wainwright at the University of Oxford, UK, said: “Humans have got used to living in particular areas at certain temperatures. When things change, serious problems arise, whether in terms of physical health, mental health, crime and social unrest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/sydney-dementia-patient-didnt-sleep-for-months-after-police-called-to-subdue-her-family-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"Sydney dementia patient ‘didn’t sleep for months’ after police called to subdue her, family say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/sydney-dementia-patient-didnt-sleep-for-months-after-police-called-to-subdue-her-family-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/sydney-dementia-patient-didnt-sleep-for-months-after-police-called-to-subdue-her-family-say","fields":{"headline":"Sydney dementia patient ‘didn’t sleep for months’ after police called to subdue her, family say","bodyText":"A family who say they were not told when police were deployed to help control their 79-year-old mother in a Sydney dementia unit are calling for a change to make it mandatory for family to be notified about the use of law enforcement. On 4 June 2020, paramedics attempted to subdue an agitated Norma Robertson, who had only been in the care of the dementia unit at HammondCare in a Sydney suburb for about four weeks. Paramedics called the police due to Robertson’s behaviour, but Robertson’s daughter Kirsty McGregor said she and her family were not notified at any point about the incident involving her mother, then aged 79. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The police didn’t call me, the paramedics didn’t call me, the hospital didn’t call me, the aged care facility didn’t call me,” she said. McGregor only found out about the incident the next day, when she was told her mother was back in the care facility. She visited to find her mother’s arms and legs covered in bruises, the cause of which was unknown to her. “After that incident, going into hospital, she pretty much didn’t sleep for months,” she said. Police said they were called following reports that a “then 79-year-old woman was acting aggressively towards staff”. “On arrival, officers were told the woman had suffered bruising to her arms after she was allegedly banging walls at the facility,” a spokesperson said. “NSW Ambulance paramedics also attended before the woman was taken to Hornsby hospital for assessment.” McGregor disputed that all the bruises were from banging walls, saying some appeared to show finger marks. She said she is not blaming police or care staff for the bruising or for calling emergency services. But she said the incident involving her mother, the use of a Taser on 95-year-old Clare Nowland in Cooma and the handcuffing of 81-year-old Rachel Grahame at a Sydney aged care home, has convinced her that reform is needed. She said police should only be deployed as an absolute last resort and only in consultation with and notification to the family. Training for police on how to respond to complex and difficult situations involving dementia sufferers is also critical, she said. “I’m not even saying that police should never be called, because I also feel for care staff,” she said. “But why aren’t the family being called first, that’s nuts. “Why aren’t they immediately calling next of kin when it’s a dementia patient who is like a four-year-old. They look like an adult, but they’re not any more. They don’t have the capacity to speak for themselves or process what’s happening. “Next of kin should have to be called so that they can be there if possible, that should be an essential service.” HammondCare’s general manager for residential care and dementia, Angela Raguz, said the company was saddened by the circumstances of the incident. “HammondCare is saddened by the circumstances that led to a resident who was experiencing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia to be transferred to Hornsby hospital in June 2020,” she said. “We would invite the resident’s family to discuss the details of her care and any concerns with us at any time convenient for them.” She said the company was not able to comment on details of a resident’s care without approval, but said staff “call for paramedic support via 000 as a last resort when residents are at risk of self-harm or harming other residents”. “Paramedics, not HammondCare, decide whether police need to be at the scene. “As she was a resident with HammondCare three years ago, the resident’s full case notes are in archival storage and not immediately available. It is not clear when family were notified. Her GP was notified shortly after her admission to Hornsby hospital.” Stephen Macfarlane, associate professor of psychiatry at Monash University and head of clinical Services at Dementia Support Australia, said the proper training of aged care staff in dementia would help them to de-escalate situations without calling police. He said that training, through no fault of staff themselves, was not currently being provided. That left police, also without specific training on dealing with dementia, in difficult situations. “They don’t have the background about the person,” he told the ABC. “They often don’t have much background about the specific situation. So I’ve got great sympathy for police when they’re put in that situation. But as I say, if they’re going to be put in that situation with any frequency, they probably need specific training on how to de-escalate issues in relation to dementia.” Rowland remains in hospital on Monday receiving end-of-life care following the use of a Taser on Wednesday morning. Local priest Mark Croker said he visited her on Sunday and performed a bedside mass, telling the Guardian she was in a heavy sleep and was comfortable. “At the same time, I think she knows that family are around her and one of them said in the last couple of days she took one of the family members’ hand and just kissed them on the hand,” Croker said. “A couple of times she has squeezed the hand of one of the family members. She is comfortable anyway, that is the main point.” The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said it was right for the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission to be overseeing the investigation into the incident which he labeled “very troubling”. “It’s really important to have confidence in the investigation taking place,” he said on Monday morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/nearly-half-of-those-seeking-australian-homelessness-charitys-help-have-jobs-but-cant-pay-soaring-rents","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"Nearly half of those seeking Australian homelessness charity’s help have jobs but can’t pay soaring rents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nearly-half-of-those-seeking-australian-homelessness-charitys-help-have-jobs-but-cant-pay-soaring-rents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nearly-half-of-those-seeking-australian-homelessness-charitys-help-have-jobs-but-cant-pay-soaring-rents","fields":{"headline":"Nearly half of those seeking Australian homelessness charity’s help have jobs but can’t pay soaring rents","bodyText":"Four in 10 people who sought help from a major homelessness charity in the past three years were employed but could not meet skyrocketing rents, according to a report by Mission Australia. The report comes as the demand for the organisation’s homelessness services, mainly based in New South Wales, jumped by 26% to 7,378 people between January 2020 to December last year. The number of people seeking help who were already homeless increased by 50% in three years to more than 3,500 people – mainly due to inadequate supply or affordable housing, the report said. Of those people experiencing homelessness, only a third were supported into secure long-term housing. Half were supported into short-term or emergency housing due to the lack of long-term housing. The report found the number of people living in tents, cars, improvised homes and sleeping rough who had sought help from its services more than doubled in three years to 640. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Seventy per cent of those who sought its help were on income support payments. The report said skyrocketing rents, low wages and income support payments, and a stark shortage of social and affordable housing, had compounded to turn homelessness in Australia into a “national emergency”. “We’re now seeing families with children, including those escaping domestic violence, more older people – specifically older women – and many people who are working full-time,” Mission Australia’s program manager, Donna Davis, said. “There really is a whole new cohort of people that need our help.” The findings follow Australian Bureau of Statistics data that found the number of people experiencing homelessness in Australia has increased by 5.2%. Last year’s annual homelessness report by the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare found that on average 300 people are turned away from homelessness services every day, primarily due to a lack of available accommodation. “It’s the worst it has ever been, and in a country like this where it should be avoidable,” said Mission Australia’s chief executive, Sharon Callister. “Australia needs to be doing so much more to be on the front foot to prevent and end homelessness in our country, instead of Band-Aid crisis solutions.” The report found there was success for many who sought the charity’s services before they became homeless, with 94% receiving the support they needed to remain living in their homes. Callister said this success proved the need for more investment in the prevention of homelessness and to invest in building one million social and affordable homes over the next 20 years. The report also called for more financial assistance for private renters, and lifting income support payments above the poverty line. The chief executive urged the government to pass the housing Australia future fund bill, which the Coalition opposes and the Greens have refused to support unless the government offers improvements, including up to $5bn of direct spending on housing and a national rent freeze. “Thirty-thousand new social and affordable housing is not nearly enough and the legislation is imperfect,” Callister said. “But it’s a start, and that’s what we need.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/jobseekers-told-use-chatgpt-write-resumes-and-study-laws-attraction","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"Australian jobseekers told to use ChatGPT to apply for jobs and shown irrelevant videos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/jobseekers-told-use-chatgpt-write-resumes-and-study-laws-attraction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/jobseekers-told-use-chatgpt-write-resumes-and-study-laws-attraction","fields":{"headline":"Australian jobseekers told to use ChatGPT to apply for jobs and shown irrelevant videos","bodyText":"A taxpayer-funded employability course is under fire after jobseekers complained that much of the compulsory training involved being shown irrelevant, inappropriate and, at-times, bizarre YouTube videos. Under contracts signed by the Coalition last year, the federal government will pay private providers about $500m over five years to run Employability Skills Training (EST) courses as part of the commonwealth’s $7bn Workforce Australia program. On its website, the department says the program offers “practical support” and “helps you become job-ready by providing intensive pre-employment training”. But Arthur, a 26-year-old honours graduate who was compelled to do the training to keep receiving jobseeker payments, said much of the course he completed consisted of watching YouTube videos. These included a motivational montage created from a YouTube channel called “Law of Attraction Coaching”, as well as videos about safety protocols at a Dutch gas company and the application guidelines for a Victorian government tender. In another session, the instructor encouraged jobseekers to use ChatGPT to write cover letters and research industries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It was like having a substitute teacher come into class and say: ‘Watch these videos, because I need to keep you here for an amount of time,’” Arthur, who did not want his surname used, told Guardian Australia. The Department of Workplace Relations and Training, the contracted EST provider, Wise Employment and its subcontractor, Paramount Training, all said Arthur’s course had deviated from the usual curriculum. The case raises further questions about the privatised employment services system after the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recently warned the system was more about “ticking the boxes rather than providing that support”. Last year, Guardian Australia reported on the use of taxpayer-funded online modules in topics such as body language, and complaints from jobseekers about other taxpayer-funded appointments and activities. The Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union and the Australian Council of Social Service have long warned about the quality of programs such as EST and work for the dole. ‘Not curriculum-endorsed materials’ Arthur said he was aware of a parliamentary inquiry to employment services and found his experience so bizarre that he decided to document the three-week course in detail. He said he had been required to select an EST course through the Workforce Australia online portal because he had been on the jobseeker payment for four months after graduating university. He chose a course run by Paramount Training, which he later learned was Wise’s subcontractor. Wise, a not-for-profit company, is one of the biggest providers in the system and holds a five-year employability skills contract worth $30m, on top of a $120m Workforce Australia contract. Some of the content was more conventional, including a video from the jobs listing site Indeed that gave advice about responding to interview questions. Other videos explained concepts such as “soft” and “hard” skills, the “hidden jobs market” and “barriers to employment”. There was also a workbook, although Arthur said this was a minor part of the course. Other videos were a mixed bag. Arthur said one video was about barriers to employment in the UK and appeared to be promoting a British job agency. Another, titled “SMART Goals Quick Overview with 21 SMART Goals Examples”, gave advice on setting professional goals, but also included advice on romantic relationships and spirituality, including becoming closer to God. Several others were bizarre, irrelevant or, to Arthur at least, condescending. These included a Ted Talk called “Drawing your dreams into reality”, which advocated creating “vision boards” for success, and a video titled “Make Body Language Your Superpower” in which Stanford students gave tips on the topic. The jobseekers were also shown a motivational video from a YouTube channel called “Law of Attraction Coaching”, which appears to promote the pseudoscience beliefs of the same name. The video did not make reference to the “Law of Attraction” and simply included a montage of motivational speeches and quotations. Arthur, who got a job shortly before he was required to complete the course, was unimpressed at jobseekers being required to watch two videos on personal hygiene, and was unsure whether several of the videos were shown by mistake. This included one explaining the process to submit tender applications for a Victorian government WorkSafe program, and another that outlined the internal safety policies for working with gas pipelines and infrastructure at a Dutch gas company. Arthur said that in another session, participants were told to use ChatGPT to research job roles and write cover letters. “I’d be pretty embarrassed to try to prove that it was worth all of the time and money [for] what they provided,” he said. A Paramount Training spokesperson said the company was “deeply concerned to learn one of our trainers may have delivered a course that does not measure up to the high standards set”. “Paramount is treating the concerns raised very seriously and has commenced an internal investigation, having suspended the trainer in question until this matter is resolved,” the spokesperson said. “To be clear, the videos that appear to have been aired, and the use of ChatGPT, are not curriculum-endorsed materials and run contrary to the way in which our courses are normally structured.” Paramount said it would reach out to all participants of the affected course to “offer re-enrolment in the next course to meet their needs”. “If any other breaches of our course structure are identified through our investigation process, we will make the same offer to all other affected parties,” they said. Wise Employment said it had recently been made aware of the situation and the course as described was “not curriculum-endorsed”. “To ensure all Wise partners are delivering content adhering to course outlines, an immediate audit of materials for all EST partners will be undertaken by our contract adviser.” A Department of Employment and Workplace Relations spokesperson said Wise Employment was “fully responsible for the performance of EST services, including any subcontract”. “The department is actively engaging with Wise Employment Ltd about the appropriateness of services delivered by its subcontracted provider,” the spokesperson said. • This story and its headline were corrected on 23 May 2023 to clarify that jobseekers were advised to use ChatGPT to write cover letters, not résumés."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/23/nt-government-knew-it-could-not-reduce-climate-risk-when-it-green-lit-carbon-bomb-gas-production-in-beetaloo-basin","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:37Z","webTitle":"NT government accused of lying about meeting climate condition before it greenlit ‘carbon bomb’ Beetaloo fracking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nt-government-knew-it-could-not-reduce-climate-risk-when-it-green-lit-carbon-bomb-gas-production-in-beetaloo-basin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/nt-government-knew-it-could-not-reduce-climate-risk-when-it-green-lit-carbon-bomb-gas-production-in-beetaloo-basin","fields":{"headline":"NT government accused of lying about meeting climate condition before it greenlit ‘carbon bomb’ Beetaloo fracking","bodyText":"New documents reveal the Northern Territory government knew it could not meet a key recommendation to reduce the climate risk of its planned massive expansion of gas production, and asked the Albanese government for help. Federal climate change officials in turn admitted Australia did not have any existing policies that would meet the recommendation in full. Advocates say the documents are proof the Northern Territory government lied when it claimed all the conditions were in place to give the green light to gas production in the Beetaloo Basin, an area of vast shale reserves 500km south-east of Darwin. Analysis suggests full production at Beetaloo would create a “carbon bomb” of 1.4bn tonnes of total emissions globally. A green light for Beetaloo When the NT government lifted its fracking moratorium in 2018, it did so with the promise there would be no move to production until all 135 recommendations from the territory’s 2018 Pepper inquiry into fracking were implemented. Earlier this month, the NT chief minister, Natasha Fyles, cleared the way for fracking production to begin in the Beetaloo Basin when she announced she was satisfied all of the inquiry’s recommendations – including recommendation 9.8 – had been met on the project. That recommendation requires the NT and federal governments to “seek to ensure” there is no net increase in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions in Australia from any unconventional gas projects in the Northern Territory. Fyles told a press conference in early May “we have absolutely met the recommendation” but later backtracked, admitting that meeting this requirement for scope 2 – the energy used by gas companies – and scope 3 – when the gas is sold and burnt – emissions would require work with the commonwealth government. Dr David Ritchie, the scientist overseeing the implementation of the inquiry, also wrote a letter saying there had been “material departures” from some of the recommendations and “no progress on the crux” of recommendation 9.8. The documents Now, new documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show the territory government knew in late 2022 it had not met the recommendation and wrote to the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, seeking the federal government’s help. “I write to continue to progress – as a matter of priority – the recommendation made by the independent Scientific Inquiry relating to greenhouse gas emissions (recommendation 9.8),” the NT’s environment and climate change minister, Lauren Moss, wrote in September. Moss asked for an “implementation committee” to be established and “a work plan developed to prioritise the development of early actions”. Bowen did not reply to her letter immediately, but an October email between his office and federal climate change officials shows some of his advisers liked the “idea of using [net] zero safeguard baselines for new gas entrants in the NT to give effect to this”. This was an idea that was ultimately agreed to only for on-site – or scope 1 – emissions through negotiations between the government and the Greens that led to the passage of amendments to the safeguard mechanism in March this year. Emails from November last year, obtained by Guardian Australia, show senior climate change officials discussing how to respond to a draft recommendation from a Senate inquiry into the Beetaloo Basin that both governments implement recommendation 9.8 and ensure any costs associated with that were borne by the gas industry. In one email, a senior official writes that the “scope 3 aspects of Pepper” could not be dealt with through the safeguard mechanism. In reply, a second official says the problem was Australia did not have any existing policies that would meet the recommendation in full. “I think the challenge is that the Minister has suggested that he wants to meet the recommendation but we collectively don’t have any programs that would get us there,” the email says. Claims NT government ‘lied’ A letter from Bowen replying to Moss was not drafted until February this year and simply noted the federal climate change department was working with the NT government to establish a “working group to ensure our policies and programs are complementary, and support your commitment to sustainable economic development in the NT consistent with our shared goal of net zero emissions by 2050”. In response to questions, Bowen and Moss said the documents had been superseded by the passage of amendments to the safeguard mechanism and the referral of “broader life cycle emissions” to the Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council for discussion. But Carmel Flint, the national coordinator for the Lock the Gate Alliance, said this claim was dubious. “Referring this recommendation to a council that hasn’t even discussed it yet does not constitute a program for implementing it,” she said. “It’s obvious neither government has a plan as to how this recommendation will be implemented, and until there is such a plan in place it is clearly misleading to suggest that it is complete.” Flint said the documents showed the territory government “lied” when it claimed all of the Pepper recommendations were in place. She pointed to Reputex analysis, which estimated that a high production scenario in the Beetaloo would create a “carbon bomb” of 1.4bn tonnes of total emissions globally, about 70 times the territory’s current annual emissions. “We’re calling for Chris Bowen to step in now and ensure that the gas production green light given by the territory government two weeks ago is overturned – given his own department has acknowledged this vital climate recommendation has clearly not been implemented,” she said. The climate scientist Bill Hare said the NT and federal governments were recycling old tactics. “What it shows is that at every step both governments have kicked the issue down the road,” he said. “It’s another way of deferring dealing with these emissions until everyone forgets about it.” He said it was still early in 2023 but there had already been major heatwaves in Asia and wildfires in Canada. “There’s a really big democratic deficit between what the science and energy agencies like the [International Energy Agency] are saying needs to happen – which is no new fossil fuel development – and what governments are doing, which is facilitating and enabling expansion and development of fossil fuel resources.” Other states could help offset On Friday, energy ministers met in Alice Springs but did not discuss recommendation 9.8. It will not be discussed until the next meeting in the third quarter of this year when climate ministers are in attendance. Bowen told reporters on Friday that dealing with all of the life cycle domestic emissions that would come from fracking in the NT would have to be managed “across jurisdictions” signalling other states and territories could be required to help the NT offset emissions associated with unconventional gas. In response to questions, a spokesperson for Bowen said the government remained committed to the full implementation of the Pepper inquiry. “The Energy and Climate Ministerial will next meet in Q3 2023,” they said. In the meantime, they said officials in a decarbonisation working group had “begun to consider this matter and will develop advice for ministers’ consideration”. Companies operating in the Beetaloo will still need to make financial decisions about whether to proceed to production and apply for necessary environmental approvals. Origin Energy sold its stake in the Beetaloo Basin to Tamboran Resources last year. Bowen himself appears to question whether the projects will be financially viable due to their remoteness, the safeguard amendments and the global energy transition. “It is the case that the Beetaloo is more remote and less developed than other prospective gas fields, closer to the east coast market, like Narrabri,” his spokesperson said. Moss said the NT government was “continuing to carefully manage the onshore gas industry through the strongest regulatory framework for onshore gas in Australia”.

The annual Olives to Oil festival collects the fruit across two weekends before turning it into oil and giving it back to participants. This year there has been a bumper harvest. So far the community has collected 20 tonnes of olives and they’re expecting to press more than 2,000 litres of oil from them. Another collection will be run in two weeks at the Hobsons Bay festival. “We were expecting that this would be a big year because we could see the trees around town were quite bountiful,” says Merrin Layden, the manager of the not-for-profit 3000Acres, which runs the festival. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “But it’s double what we thought we might get – the biggest previous year was 6.6 tonnes.” Eight years ago Eltham resident Fiona Wilson purchased a tiny olive tree from the nursery at Ceres and on Saturday she was taking back its olives. “We’ve processed olives for eating over the years but we’ve always wanted to do the olive oil,” Wilson said. Wilson put in more than 18kg of olives and is hoping to get more than a litre of oil. But it’s not just about the bounty, she says, it’s also about community. “Everyone in the line was having a chat, talking about how they grew their olives,” Wilson says. “And the olive pressing process was really interesting too.” The first Olives to Oil harvest was in 2018, when just 200kg of the fruit was dropped off. The collection point was on a staff member’s front porch. It has exploded since, with hundreds of people across the state travelling to Ceres to drop off their olives. Layden says the festival is about celebrating the cultural heritage of Melbourne. “In the postwar era, we had big Greek, Italian and other Mediterranean populations migrating to Melbourne who brought olive trees – a lot of them original stock from their places of origin,” she says. Making oil from olives is difficult to do for households, as you need access to a processor, a large batch of olives and complicated equipment, she says. “The program was born out of wanting to bring the community together over a shared harvesting tradition,” Layden says. “Which goes back to villages in the Greek Islands, where there is a village press, and people will harvest together and press together and celebrate the oil that they get.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/23/worried-about-your-laundry-releasing-microplastics-a-filter-could-be-a-simple-solution","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T15:00:37Z","webTitle":"Worried about your laundry releasing microplastics?

A filter could be a simple solution","bodyText":"You might not know it, but installing a washing machine filter might be one of the simplest defences against microplastics entering the ocean. Scientists estimate there are 14m tonnes of microplastic on the ocean floor, and a further 24tn grains floating on the surface of the ocean. Microplastics come from many sources – they can shed from clothes, sneakers and bags made from synthetic materials; or they can be the product of larger pieces of plastic breaking down into smaller and smaller particles. But 35% of microplastic pollution in the ocean is thought to come from the turbulence and friction of putting our clothes, sheets and towels through the washing machine, which release microfibres – a subcategory of microplastics. A white paper delivered to the European Commission last month argues that washing machine filters are the only effective near-term solution to reducing the release of microfibres into the environment and should be mandated (the technology exists but inbuilt filters are extremely scarce). The white paper was co-authored by A Plastic Planet and 5 Gyres Institute with three washing machine filter manufacturers, Matter, PlanetCare and Xeros Technology. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Christian Cullinane from Xeros Technology says washing machine filters are capable of preventing “more than 90%” of microfibres in our laundry from entering the water. Historically there have been questions raised about the effectiveness of filters, with studies rating their effectiveness from as low as 29% to as high as 74%. But other solutions – such as developments in fabric technology to prevent shedding, or catching the fibres at wastewater treatment plants (when an estimated 80% of all wastewater is released without being treated) – are not immediately viable, making filters a good option for now. In Australia, as part of the national plastics plan, the federal government has proposed a “phase-in” of microfibre filters in new commercial and residential washing machines by 2030. In the meantime, it is possible to retrofit your washing machine with a microfibre filter – if you have the money to spare. Here experts explain how to do this. What is a retrofitted washing machine filter? A retrofit filter is an external filter system that connects to the outlet hose of your washing machine. It captures the microfibres that are released from your laundry before they go down the drain. According to Dr Andrej Kržan, a co-founder of Planet Care, their filters are so fine they catch “all sorts of stuff. Pet hair, you get grass. Some people have small kids so you get sparkles in there too.” There are several options on the market that range from about $100 to more than $300 and can be ordered online from websites such as Planet Care, Gulp (pre-order only) and Filtrol. Is a microfibre filter right for your household? The filters can be quite bulky, so you will need to consider the available space in your laundry before deciding which type to buy one. Some filters can be mounted to the side of the machine or on a nearby wall, so if your machine is tucked neatly into a cupboard, this might not be possible. Others, like the Gulp filter, can sit on top or beside the machine, but need to be plugged into a powerpoint. And since the filter will need to be emptied or replaced every 20 or so washes (this varies, depending on the brand), you will need to install it somewhere that is easily accessible. How to dispose of the microfibres It is essential to properly dispose of the microfibres and other materials that are caught in the filter. The disposal process varies depending on the product. Fibres captured in the Gulp filter can be brushed into the bin, while PlanetCare uses a swap-and-replace system, where users remove the filter cartridge and post it back to the company. The company cleans the cartridge and sends a new one to the user. Xeros’ XFilter – which is designed to be installed by washing machine manufacturers, and is not yet commercially available – should be removed and emptied over a bin, according to Cullinane. “It’s very simple, but it’s not a horrible sludge that the customer’s tempted to run under a tap or do anything like which would completely subvert the use.” Some companies are working on solutions to recycle the particles but these are in their early development stage. According to PlanetCare, the fibres will be turned into insulation mats. Matter, the company that makes the Gulp filter, is trialling a system where the user returns the microfibres with the intention they will be recycled into hard and soft plastic. When you can’t install a filter … If you don’t have the space to install an external microfibre filter, another way to reduce microfibre pollution is by using a Guppyfriend bag. Place your polyester or synthetic garments inside a bag before placing it in your washing machine. The bag catches any microfibres that may break off during the laundry cycle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/uk-fruit-exports-to-eu-have-dropped-by-more-than-half-since-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:59:02Z","webTitle":"UK fruit exports to EU have dropped by more than half since Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/uk-fruit-exports-to-eu-have-dropped-by-more-than-half-since-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/uk-fruit-exports-to-eu-have-dropped-by-more-than-half-since-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK fruit exports to EU have dropped by more than half since Brexit","bodyText":"Exports of fruit from the UK to the EU, including traditional English apples and pears, have more than halved since Brexit, according to data released by HMRC. The decline has been put down to the introduction of trade barriers caused by the UK’s departure from the EU, including mandatory health certificates on fresh and chilled food and customs paperwork. Similar barriers have yet to be introduced on imports to the UK, causing recent concern about the threat to future imports of some of British diners’ favourites, including fresh cheese, olive oil and dried meats from Spain and Italy. HMRC data shows that the barriers, in place since 2021, are already biting on the UK-to-EU side of the Brexit ledger. In the year to 31 March 2021, the UK sold £248.5m worth of fruit to the EU. But sales figures dropped to £119m the next year, and have remained at that level since, with latest tax data showing sales for the year to March 2023 of £113.8m. The chartered accountancy firm Hazelwoods, which analysed the figures, blamed a number of factors including the risk to farmers who are selling fruit, which may end up rotting if delayed by customs or phytosanitary officials in Calais and other EU ports. But they also said that, with the delays and extra cost of fruit, retailers in continental Europe were now less likely to buy from the UK and were choosing to import fruit from other countries within the bloc. “Long delays at UK ports are dissuading many fruit farmers from sending their produce abroad,” said Rebecca Copping, a partner at Hazelwoods. “For a nation with an historic reputation for producing high-quality fruit, it’s a shame that red-tape is making it harder for farmers to export their wares.” “Even double-digit inflation hasn’t been enough to bring the value of fruit exports into the black. This shows just how much damage has been inflicted on the sector.” Analysis of HMRC data showed that the overall value of exports to the EU of food had increased but Hazelwoods said “a large proportion of this increase in value can be attributed to rising inflation in food prices, following the Ukraine crisis”. The different approach taken by the EU and the UK to checks has been the source of tension between the government and the British horticulture sector, with farming bosses accusing the government of giving European suppliers an unfair advantage over domestic producers. Brexit checks on food and animal products including unpasteurised cheese from the EU have been delayed four times by the British government and are due to start being phased in at the end of October. Last week Logistics UK, which represents cargo and freight owners, raised concern over the government’s readiness to implement the changes at a meeting with the cabinet minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe. “Logistics UK and its members support the UK’s 2025 border strategy but remain concerned that there is still much to be done,” said Nichola Mallon, Logistics UK’s head of trade. They told her they were particularly concerned about trucks carrying produce from multiple suppliers, a practice known as groupage. Under the rules, a lorry could be stopped if just one supplier did not provide the correct paperwork, meaning the entire load could be delayed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2023/may/22/stan-grant-qa-presenter-cites-poison-of-the-media-as-he-steps-away-from-abc-show","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:58:27Z","webTitle":"Stan Grant: Q+A presenter cites ‘poison’ of the media as he steps away from ABC show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/22/stan-grant-qa-presenter-cites-poison-of-the-media-as-he-steps-away-from-abc-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2023/may/22/stan-grant-qa-presenter-cites-poison-of-the-media-as-he-steps-away-from-abc-show","fields":{"headline":"Stan Grant: Q+A presenter cites ‘poison’ of the media as he steps away from ABC show","bodyText":"Stan Grant, the presenter of the ABC’s Q+A, was given a standing ovation after citing the “poison” of the media as the reason he had decided to step away from the show. In an emotional end to Monday night’s episode, Grant faced the studio camera and said he was not leaving because of racist abuse that he had received, but because he felt he was “part of the problem”. “I’m not walking away for a while because of racism,” the Wiradjuri journalist said. “We get that far too often. I’m not walking away because of social media hatred. I need a break from the media. I feel like I’m part of the problem. And I need to ask myself how, or if, we can do it better. “We in the media must ask if we are truly honouring a world worth living in. Too often, we are the poison in the bloodstream of our society. I fear the media does not have the love or the language to speak to the gentle spirits of our land.” Grant announced on Friday he was standing down from the show, saying he had received “grotesque racist abuse” that escalated after he spoke on the ABC about the impact of colonialism on Indigenous Australians ahead of the king’s coronation. On the show on Monday, Grant also thanked those who had offered their support, while adding that those who had targeted him with racist abuse had “succeeded” in hurting him and his family. “To those who have abused me and my family. I would just say if your aim was to hurt me, well you’ve succeeded, and I’m sorry. “I’m sorry that I must have given you so much cause to hate me so much, to target me and my family and to make threats against me. I’m sorry. “Sometimes we need to just take time out. Sometimes our souls are hurting and so it is for me. I’ve had to learn that endurance is not always strength. Sometimes strength is knowing when to say stop. “I am down right now, I am. But I will get back up. And you can come at me again, and I will meet you with the love of my people,” he said. “To my people – I have always wanted to represent you with pride. I know I might disappoint you sometimes, but in my own little way, I’ve just wanted to make us seen. And I’m sorry that I can’t do that for a little while.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a column published on the ABC website on Friday announcing his decision to step away, Grant said he had seen people in the media “lie and distort” his words, and also targeted ABC’s management, saying no one had supported him publicly since he appeared on the panel. “I am writing this because no one at the ABC – whose producers invited me on to their coronation coverage as a guest – has uttered one word of public support,” he said. “Not one ABC executive has publicly refuted the lies written or spoken about me. I don’t hold any individual responsible; this is an institutional failure.” The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, and the ABC news chief, Justin Stevens, both apologised to Grant, with Stevens saying he regrets not defending him earlier. “I’m the person who’s responsible ultimately for the journalism and the decisions,” Stevens told Raf Epstein on ABC Melbourne. “I’m saying stop going after people for doing their jobs.” Stevens said Grant faced racist attacks on social media fuelled by what he described as a “relentless campaign” against the ABC’s coronation broadcast from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Stevens accused News Corp of targeting the ABC because it was “trying to chip away [at] people’s sense of trust in what we do because we threaten their business model”. The Australian, Sky News and other papers have criticised the ABC for hosting a panel discussion about the impact of colonialism on Indigenous Australians and the relevance of the monarchy in 2023. The discussion went on for 45 minutes in the lead-up to the coronation, and was over hours before the event itself. Much of the criticism focused on Grant, with Stevens saying sections of the media engaged in a “piling on”, “with a clear agenda” and that they played a part in “amplifying and giving agency” to the racist trolls on social media. On Monday, Stevens addressed a gathering of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff outside the ABC office in Sydney, who were among the many staff across the country rallying in solidarity with Grant. The newly appointed head of Indigenous news at the ABC, Suzanne Dredge, spoke to the gathering in Ultimo, which included supporters from the Indigenous public broadcaster NITV. “We want this to be a turning point for the ABC, for First Nations journalists, the media as a whole and for the Australian community,” Dredge said. “We need to call out racism and do more to address this awful blight on all of us. The impact it has on First Nations communities across the country is devastating. We know First Nations and diverse journalists are targeted more than anyone else on social media.” Guardian Australia has approached News Corp for comment on the criticism from the ABC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/football-daily-email-manchester-city-champions","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:54:15Z","webTitle":"Football Daily | Manchester City’s relentless winning machine and that unavoidable elephant ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/football-daily-email-manchester-city-champions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/football-daily-email-manchester-city-champions","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City’s relentless winning machine and that unavoidable elephant ","bodyText":"THE CHAMPS ARE HERE. AGAIN As they wrapped up the title with three games to spare, it seemed vaguely fitting that Manchester City prefaced their coronation as Premier League champions with victory over the kind of cautionary rabble they could become themselves at some point whenever Pep Guardiola decides to leave the club. Chelsea weren’t as dreadful as they have been at many points throughout a season of violent self-sabotage, but for months they have been considerably less than the sum of their many very expensive and talented parts; a massive source of mirth for everyone but their own disbelieving fans. In much the same way as it seems inconceivable Chelsea will be as awful again when the new season dawns, given the excellence of some of their performances it seems similarly unlikely City will be quite as good. But assuming Guardiola isn’t tempted to walk off into the sunset like Kwai Chang Caine at the end of an episode of Kung Fu if his side wins Big Cup, there is every reason to believe that with a bit of tinkering he will further soup-up and fine-tune his already relentless winning machine. While City’s players, staff and supporters celebrated their fifth title in six years at the Etihad Stadium, they will have been acutely aware that this was merely the first and arguably most routine instalment of a bigger trilogy. While the FA Cup has lost so much of its magic that even conversations about how much of its magic it has lost have lost their magic, winning it against your most bitter rivals to wrap up the second instalment of a prospective treble certainly makes it a whole lot more Hogwarts, not least when those bitter rivals are the only club in English history to have won that particular treble before. “We will celebrate tonight and then move on to try and create history,” whooped Kyle Walker a few hours before he and his teammates rocked up at trendy Manchester nightspot MNKY HSE, no doubt to enjoy some Latin American cuisine re-imagined by chef Mark Morrans in a bold and indulgent sharing menu. “Rest assured we are not finished. We have the FA Cup against our bitter rivals and then [Big Cup].” Having arrived in what looked suspiciously like monogrammed pyjamas, Erling Haaland promptly rustled up a steak in the kitchen, while Walker serenaded John Stones with a re-imagining of Boney M’s Daddy Cool that included some b@nterific United-baiting. Of course while all connected with City have every right to enjoy and celebrate their triumph, it behoves Football Daily in its role as a small cog in the giant media wheel that – according to those who guzzle down the Abu Dhabi Kool-Aid – is the well-documented conspiracy to further smear the club’s good name by pointing out that their latest state-funded title has left many folk cold. With those 115 charges of alleged financial shenanigans that nobody used to talk about but now can’t stop mentioning still hanging over them, each piece of silverware comes temporarily marked by an asterisk that can’t be ignored. With no end in sight to the investigation into these allegations, one suspects all those tainted by association would like to see the matter closed for good sooner rather than later. The City hierarchy have already stated as much but in reportedly raising an objection to Murray Rosen, head of the independent panel tasked with judging them, being an Arsenal fan, as well as other legal challenges, they seem absolutely hell-bent on obstructing what should be a fairly straightforward process at every turn.

The move is being pushed by the Department for Transport (DfT) in order to cut costs as it looks to “reform all aspects of the railway”. Most British train services now provide free wifi as standard but the DfT has told its contracted operators in England that they should cease offering it if they cannot justify it financially. The department said it was looking for “value for money” and wifi was low on passenger’s priorities, particularly on shorter journeys. More here. Meta’s shares are rallying despite the company being hit by a record €1.2bn fine by Ireland’s privacy regulator over its handling of user information. Shares in Meta have jumped 2.3% in early trading, to $251.25, extending their strong rally this year. As we covered earlier, Meta has been given five months to stop transferring users’ data to the United States, after Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), ruled Facebook had broken rules requiring that transfers of personal data from the EU to the US had appropriate safeguards in place. John Magee, Head of Data Protection, Privacy &amp; Cybersecurity, at law firm DLA Piper Ireland predicts the suspension order will “probably bite much harder” for Meta, both operationally and commercially, than the record fine. Leaving aside the specifics of the long-running case against Meta, the DPC’s decision also carries major implications for businesses across all sectors engaged in the day-to-day activity of international transfers of personal data. Meeting the requirements of the Schrems II case has already proved a challenge even for the most sophisticated and well-resourced organisations. And while global data transfers are still possible to lawfully carry out, the DPC’s decision has now raised the stakes, focussing attention on the controls that organisations need to have in place as well as forcing businesses to think about their overall data governance strategies. Daisy Fulton, lawyer at BDB Pitmans, predicts Meta could face similar legal headaches in the UK: The eye-watering fine of €1.2bn was imposed on Meta Ireland for its failure to protect individuals’ personal data when sending that data to the US. Meta Ireland had failed to do this even after a European Court judgement had made it clear that those protections needed to be in place. As the law in the UK is currently very similar to the EU, we may find the UK taking a similar approach. That means businesses in the UK who are transferring personal data to the US should sit up and take notice and ensure they have the necessary protective measures in place to avoid a large fine themselves. American Airlines is challenging Micron for the bottom spot on the S&amp;P 500 index. American Airlines’s shares have dropped 4%, making it the second largest faller. On Friday, an US federal judge has ruled a more than two-year-old alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways was anticompetitive. The judge ordered the two carriers to end the Northeast Alliance (NEA) within 30 days. Under the alliance the two airlines coordinated schedules at Boston Logan International Airport and at airports in the New York region. Ding ding ding goes the Wall Street opening bell, and down go Micron’s shares. Micron’s shares have dropped by 4.5% at the start of trading, losing around $3 to $65. They’re the biggest faller on the S&amp;P 500 at the open. Traders are trying to judge the financial impact of China’s ban on Micron’s use in key infrastructure projects, with CFO Mark Murphy predicting a single-digit percentage hit to revenues today. Micron chief financial officer Mark Murphy has told a conference today the company was unclear what concerns China had, after Beijing banned Micron’s products from key infrastructure projects due to security risks. Reuters has the details: He said Micron’s direct and indirect sales to China-headquartered companies accounted for about one-fourth of its total revenue. “We are currently estimating a range of impact in the low single digits percent of our company total revenue at the low end and high single-digit percentage of total company revenue at the high end,” he said. Just in: Israel’s central bank has increased borrowing costs to the highest level since 2006, as it continues to battle inflation. The Bank of Israel voted to lift its main policy rate by a quarter of one percent, from 4.5% to 4.75%. Amnnouncing the move, the Bank of Israel points out that annual inflation hit 5% in April (prices rose by 0.8% during the month. The Bank is also concerned that inflation expectations, and forecasts, for consumer prices in a year’s time, are all around the upper bound of its target range It says: Economic activity in Israel is at a high level, and is accompanied by a tight labor market, although there is some moderation in a number of indicators. Inflation is broad and remains high. Therefore, the Monetary Committee decided to increase the interest rate. The interest rate path will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. Micron is still heading for a fall when Wall Street opens in around 90 minutes. Shares in Micron are down over 4% in pre-market trading, after Beijign declared its products were a security risk and blocked their use in key infrastructure projects. Brad Bechtel of Jefferies says: China’s engaging on the chip tit-for-tat with the US by targeting Micron chips puts the focus squarely on South Korea to see if they will fill the gap with Samsung chips, something the US purportedly asked them not to do. The geopolitical situation in the region continues to intensify. Goldman Sachs have estimated that the US could run out of cash on 8th or 9th June unless the debt ceiling is lifted. In a new report, Goldman Sachs estimates the current ‘extraordinary measures’ being used by the US Treasury, since it hit the US’s borrowing limit, will run out of space in under three weeks. Goldman economists Alec Phillips and Tim Krupa wrote in the note to clients, which Bloomberg first reported, that the US could run out of cash sooner, saying: “The estimate is subject to substantial uncertainty so there is certainly a chance that receipts could slow more than expected and leave the Treasury short of cash by June 1 or 2.” Last weekend, US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen insisted that 1st June was a “hard deadline” for raising the federal debt limit. She suggested it was unlikely the government would collect enough revenue to tide them over until 15th June, when more tax receipts are due. Yellen told NBC’s “Meet the Press” programme: “I indicated in my last letter to Congress that we expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June and possibly as soon as June 1. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven’t changed my assessment. So I think that that’s a hard deadline.” New Democracy’s strong performance in last weekend’s election puts Greece on track to reclaim an investment-grade rating, 13 years after losing it, Bloomberg reports, adding: The benchmark Athens Stock Exchange General Index jumped to its highest level in almost a decade, with a gauge of bank shares rising 16%. The premium investors demand to hold Greek 10-year debt compared with super-safe bonds of Germany fell to the lowest in more than a year. Facebook’s owner, Meta, has been fined a record €1.2bn (£1bn) and ordered to suspend the transfer of user data from the EU to the US. The fine imposed by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which regulates Meta across the EU, is a record for a breach of the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The suspension of Facebook data transfers is not immediate and Meta has been given five months to enact it. The DPC punishment relates to a legal challenge brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that European users’ data is not sufficiently protected from US intelligence agencies when it is transferred across the Atlantic. The ruling does not impact data transfers at Meta’s other main platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp. More here. Facebook owner Meta has hit out against the €1.2bn (£1bn) fine announced today for breaching EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules, calling it ‘flawed and unjustified’. Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said the company was…  disappointed to have been singled out when using the same legal mechanism as thousands of other companies looking to provide services in Europe.” This decision is flawed, unjustified and sets a dangerous precedent for the countless other companies transferring data between the EU and US.” Greece’s stock market is roaring higher today, after the country’s right-wing New Democracy party claimed a strong first place in last weekend’s elections. Athens’ ASE share index has jumped by 7% this morning, while Greek bonds are also strengthening in value, with investors anticipating a continuation of Greece’s current economic policies. Greece’s conservative prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis hailed the result as a “political earthquake”, even though New Democracy didn’t quite win enough votes for a majority. New Democracy party were heading for almost 41% of the vote, five seats short of a majority, and well ahead of the left-wing Syriza party led by former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, which won around 20% support. Bill Blain, market strategist at Shard Capital, wrote this morning: [Greece’s] right-wing government did surprisingly well in the polls telling us the public want experience, clarity and certainty – the economy is in recovery and may even win back investment grade status, but Greek friends tell me it still feels like austerity. Today, Mitsotakis was handed a three-day mandate by Greece’s president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, to explore the options of forming a coalition. But, Mitsotakis would rather govern alone, as our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: Aides said the 55-year-old leader, who appeared in ebullient mood as he arrived at New Democracy’s headquarters in Athens, would prefer a repeat poll with Sunday’s result hardening his view that a single-party government was “more than possible”. In an address on Sunday night the prime minister said he was “proud and moved” by the result. “Hope has beaten pessimism, unity has beaten division,” Mitsotakis said. “I pledge to work even harder. People want a strong government with a four-year mandate so that we can cover the lost ground that separates us from Europe. A government is needed that really must believe in reforms so that it can implement them.” More travel news: Heathrow airport is pledging that next week’s strike by security staff will not lead to flight cancellations during the half-term rush. Members of the Unite union working at Terminal 5 will walk out from May 25 to 27 in an ongoing dispute over pay. But Heathrow has insisted that passengers will have a smooth journey through Heathrow during the half-term getaway. Britain’s largest airport said said its contingency plans, which include deploying extra staff, have delivered “excellent passenger service” throughout previous strike periods, with “almost all” travellers waiting less than 10 minutes to pass through security. Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “Passengers should not be concerned about strike action by Unite over the half term getaway. The 15 days of strike action over the Easter peak and Coronation weekends have had no impact on the smooth running of the airport, and passengers have not noticed any difference from the normal great service they expect at Heathrow.” “These strikes are completely unnecessary. When I speak to colleagues the overwhelming message is that they just want to vote on our pay offer, but Unite won’t let them. We made a generous 10% offer early on, to make sure colleagues got a substantial increase when they needed it most. Unite’s delays mean non-union colleagues as well as the majority of colleagues who are union members, who voted to accept our previous offer are losing out.” A year ago, Heathrow was gripped by disruption, with passengers suffering long queues and last-minute cancellations blamed on staff shortages. Begbies Traynor Group, the business recovery, financial advisory and property services consultancy, has lifted its financial forecasts this morning. Begbies Traynor told the City its results for the last 12 months are expected to be ahead of market expectations. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says this highlights problems in the wider economy. “A better-than-expected trading update from corporate restricting group Begbies Traynor is good news for its shareholders, but typically a negative sign for the state of UK business. It has reported an increase in liquidations and administrations which is a worry for the economy, so too is guidance from Begbies for further challenges to UK businesses.” Revenue is expected to increase by 11% in the year to 30 April, with adjusted pretax profits tipped to grow by 16%. Ric Traynor, executive chairman of Begbies Traynor Group, says: “We performed strongly in the financial year, with results ahead of market expectations, aided by our increased scale and enhanced reputation in mid-market insolvency. “We have further developed our range of services, extending both our financial advisory business and property advisory services through earnings accretive acquisitions principally funded by strong cash generation. Back on the Micron-China news, Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, says chipmakers face potentially “politically treacherous waters.” “Following a cyber security investigation China has decided to ban certain Micron memory products from the country, which will come as no surprise to many as it probably represents a retaliatory move following US restrictions on China’s access to technology. “Around 11% of Micron’s revenue comes from China but we shall see how much this ban actually impacts its revenue because the ban is currently for domestic critical information infrastructure operators which is essentially used for defence, military and utilities. However, if this is broadened then it could put a dent in the company’s future revenues. “The second unknown is the memory market is very homogenous. The two other major producers of similar technology are Samsung and Hynix and both companies have been asked by the US to not ship to China. How they respond will be key for Micron. “Both the South Korean companies will now be closely watched to see how they behave in the face of the US request as they have manufacturing factories in China whereas Micron does not. The companies may now need to navigate what could be politically treacherous waters.” Shares in Meta are down 1% in pre-market US trading, after the company was hit by a record fine for EU privacy violations. Meta has been hit with a record fine by regulators for mishandling user information. Meta, the parent of Facebook, has been fined a record €1.2bn (£1.05bn) by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission following an inquiry. This beats the previous record of €746m levied on Amazon by Luxembourg in 2021. Metaa must also suspend any future transfer of personal data to the US within five months. The DPC ruled that Facebook had violated its rules requiring platforms to ensure data transfers from Europe to the US have appropriate safeguards in place. In today’s ruling, it says: While Meta Ireland effected those transfers on the basis of the updated Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) that were adopted by the European Commission in 2021 in conjunction with additional supplementary measures that were implemented by Meta Ireland, the DPC found that these arrangements did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects that were identified by the CJEU in its judgment. The ruling relates to a legal challenge brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that European users’ data is not sufficiently protected from US intelligence agencies when it is transferred across the Atlantic. My colleague Dan Milmo explained the background to the case here: China’s commerce minister, Wang Wentao, has declared that the country will continue to welcome US-funded firms. Speaking after Beijing barred Micron from selling memory chips to key domestic industries. Wang insisted that China was open to foreign firms. He told a seminar in Shanghai that: “China’s economy is recovering and improving, and the market potential continues to be released, which will provide more development opportunities for enterprises from all over the world, including U.S. companies.” Back in the chip sector, shares in other US chipmakers are also under pressures, Qualcomm and Broadcom are both down around 0.75% in pre-market trading. The average price tag on a home reached a record high in May, as activity picked up across the housing market. The average asking price jumped by £6,647 or 1.8% month-on-month, new data from Rightmove shows, lifting the average asking price for a home coming to market to £372,894. This is the largest monthly increase for 2023 so far, and above the 1% increase typically seen during May. Rightmove reports that sellers were cautious earlier this year, following the fallout from the mini-Budget. But with buyer demand 3% higher than in 2019, asking prices are moving higher. This doesn’t mean that houses are selling for record levels, though. Official data shows that house prices in February were £5,000 below the recent peak in November 2022, while Nationwide reports that prices rose in April after seven months of declines. Higher mortgage rates, following 12 interest rate increases in a row, mean borrowing to buy a new home is rather more expensive than in 2021. Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s Director of Property Science, says: “This month’s strong jump in new seller asking prices looks like a belated reaction and a sign of increasing confidence from sellers, as we’d usually see such a big monthly increase earlier in the spring season. One reason for this increased confidence may be that the gloomy start-of-the-year predictions for the market are looking increasingly unlikely. What is much more likely is that the market will continue to transition to a more normal activity level this year following the exceptional activity of the pandemic years. Steadying mortgage rates and a generally more positive outlook for the economy are also contributing to more seller confidence, though there are likely to be more twists and turns to come. The market is still very price-sensitive and it is important that new sellers do not damage their prospects of a sale by overpricing initially and reducing later, with agents reporting that it’s the realistically-priced new instructions that are selling best.” Rightmove reports that demand is being driven by the first-time-buyer and second-stepper sectors, while houses at the top of the market are taking longer to sell: European stock markets have made a mixed start to trading, as investors digest China’s ruling that products made by US memory chip giant Micron Technology are a national security risk. The UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 0.3% or 22 points to 7,779 points, but France’s CAC and Germanys DAX are both down around 0.1%, with the US debt ceiling deadline also on traders’ minds. Saxo’s strategy team told clients this morning: After a cyber-security review, China’s Cyberspace Administration of China ordered that Chinese companies dealing with critical information stop buying chips from US-based Micron Technology. The review said that Micron’s chips posed “relatively serious cybersecurity problems” that could “seriously danger the supply chain of China’s critical information infrastructure.” The move was widely viewed as a retaliation against recent US limitations on exporting high-end chips and chip-manufacturing equipment to China. A US Commerce Department spokesperson said the move has “no basis in fact”. Mainland China and Hong Kong revenue exposure is around 15% of total revenue for Micron Technology. China’s ban on Micron products in critical national infrastructure is a possible escalation of Trade War rhetoric, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. He adds: Biden says ties with China to improve “very shortly”...not sure if he is reading the same script as everyone else? Shares in Micron have dropped over 6% in pre-market US trading, after China ruled its products posed “serious network security risks”. That follows the 5% drop in Frankfurt trading this morning (see earlier post), in the light of China banning operators of key infrastructure from buying Micron chips. The price of wheat has dropped to the lowest level in over two years, which may bring some relief to struggling households worldwide. Chicago wheat futures fell below $6 a bushel, the lowest since April 2021. They were pushed down by expectations of ample global supplies after the deal to ship Ukrainian grains was extended last week. One Singapore-based grains trader told Reuters: “Global wheat market seems to be well-supplied even though there are some worries around the U.S. winter crop.” The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade dipped over 1% this morning to $5.98 a bushel, the lowest since April 2021. Last week, the Ukraine Black Sea grain deal was extended for two more months, easing concerns over world supplies. Worries about the ongoing US debt ceiling talks have also weighed on the agricultural markets, on fears that the US could default if the limit is not raised soon. US president Joe Biden and House Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to discuss the issue later today, after holding a “productive” phone call on the continued impasse over the debt ceiling on Sunday. Ryanair has bounced back to a near-record €1.4bn (£1.2bn) profit last year and expects to better that in 2023, fuelled by a summer boom in which the low-cost airline will carry a record number of passengers. Europe’s largest airline swung back to profit in the year to the end of March after reporting a €355m loss in the previous year. The company, led by the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said it was cautiously optimistic that it will increase profits again this year, which could result in it topping the record €1.45bn Ryanair made in 2018. “To date, summer 2023 demand is robust and peak summer 2023 fares are trending ahead of last year,” O’Leary said, adding: “First-quarter fares, which benefited from a strong Easter in April – and a very weak previous year comparable due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – will be significantly higher than the first quarter of 2022-23.” The airline, which earlier this month spent $40bn (£32bn) on 300 new aircraft from Boeing in a bet it can continue to outperform European rivals, carried a record 168 million passengers last year. More here: Shares in Micron, listed in Frankfurt, have dropped by over 5% in “thin early morning deals”, Reuters reports, as traders respond to Beijing banning its chips from use in key domestic industries. In the UK, the government has cut the taxpayer’s stake in NatWest bank, which it bought in the financial crisis. NatWest has agreed to buy around 469m shares from HM Treasury at a price of 268.4p per share – the price at which they closed on Friday night. This will cost £1.3bn, and reduce government’s stake in NatWest to 38.69% from around 41% today. NatWest’s CEO, Alison Rose says the deal “demonstrates positive progress” on the bank’s strategic priorities and the path to privatisation. Rose adds: NatWest Group’s robust balance sheet and capital generation allow us to continue lending responsibly and supporting the customers and communities we serve whilst delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders, including the government.” At its peak in 2009, the UK government owned 84% of NatWest – which was previously called Royal Bank of Scotland before a post-crash rebrand. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: Last month the government announced a two-year extension to its trading plan. The Treasury is aiming to return NatWest to private ownership by 2025-2026 while attempting to ‘achieve the best value for the taxpayer’. In April, the government’s shareholding stood at 42%, down from a peak of 84%, falling further again this week. Shares in NatWest have struggled this year, caught up in the banking sector turmoil with the collapse of SVB and the rescue deal for Credit Suisse. However, with shares up almost 15% year-on-year to Friday’s close, the government clearly decided that now is a good moment to sell some shares. Jefferies analysts expected limited impact on Micron, though. They argue that its major customers in China are consumer electronics firms such as smartphone and computer manufacturers, not infrastructure suppliers. In a research note, Jefferies say: “Since Micron’s DRAM and NAND products are much less in servers, we believe most of its revenue in China is not generated from telcos and the government. Therefore, the ultimate impact on Micron will be quite limited.” It generated $5.2bn of revenue from China including $1.7bn from Hong Kong last year, about 16% of its total revenue, according to Jefferies. The announcement that Micron had failed China’s security review helped to boost shares in some local chipmaking-related firms on Monday State media reported that domestic players could benefit from the move. Shares in Ingenic Semiconductor,a fabless semiconductor company based in Beijing, are up 2.5% in late trading, while Shenzhen Kaifa, which designs, tests and manufacturers semiconductors, are 2% higher. Some of Micron’s major rivals also saw their shares gain. SK Hynix are up 0.8%, although Samsung Electronics dipped back after an early rally. Shares in Chinese chip-related stocks had also jumped in April when Beijing launched the probe into Micron. Bernstein analysts said in a note that: “As China’s domestic memory suppliers are not competitive in technologies and capacity, China would need to resort to Samsung, SK Hynix, Kioxia, Western Digital or other foreign suppliers as the alternative to Micron. Beijing’s move against Micron brings fresh uncertainty to the other US chipmakers that sell to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors. Holden Triplett, founder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former FBI counterintelligence official in Beijing, says (via Bloomberg): “No one should understand this decision by CAC as anything but retaliation for the US’s export controls on semiconductors. “No foreign business operating in China should be deceived by this subterfuge. These are political actions pure and simple, and any business could be the next one to be made an example of.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Tensions between Washington and Beijing are rising after China announced that products made by US chipmaker Micron Technology have failed to pass a cybersecurity review. China’s government told users of sensitive computer equipment they must stop buying products from Micron, the biggest US memory chipmaker. Micron, China says, had failed a network security review announced last month, meaning operators of key infrastructure are now barred from buying from the company. Announcing the move, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said: The review found that Micron’s products have serious network security risks, which pose significant security risks to China’s critical information infrastructure supply chain, affecting China’s national security. The decision could include sectors ranging from telecoms to transport and finance, according to China’s broad definition of critical information infrastructure. Micron, which is headquartered in Boise, Idaho, makes products including DRAM chips, flash memory, and solid state hard drives. through its Crucial, Ballistix Gaming and SpecTek brands. The move escalates the ongoing US-China row over technology and security. Last November, the Biden administration banned approvals of new telecommunications equipment from China’s Huawei Technologies and ZTE, saying they posed “an unacceptable risk” to U.S. national security. A spokesperson from the US Commerce Department has criticised China’s move, saying: “We firmly oppose restrictions that have no basis in fact,” “This action, along with recent raids and targeting of other American firms, is inconsistent with [China’s] assertions that it is opening its markets and committed to a transparent regulatory framework.” Shares in some rival chipmakers rose on the news (more on that shortly…). The Micron ban came as G7 leaders, who met in Hiroshima last weekend, announced they want to de-risk from China, rather than decouple. Joe Biden explained: “That means taking steps to diversify our supply chains.” Rishi Sunak went further, saying China poses the biggest challenge to global security and prosperity of our age. The UK PM warned that China has the “means and intent to reshape the world order”, and that G7 leaders had shown “unity and resolve” in confronting the problems posed by Beijing.

The Scapa Flow Museum tells the story of how the island of Hoy became essential to Britain’s defence with the construction of a large naval base. It reopened last year after a £4.4m redevelopment. The museum is one of five shortlisted for the UK award organised by the Art Fund. The others are the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, Leighton House in London, the MAC in Belfast and the Natural History Museum in London. The finalists were “at the top of their game, offering inspirational collections and programmes for their communities, for visitors from across the UK and around the world”, said Jenny Waldman, the director of Art Fund. “From transformational redevelopment to community involvement, to addressing the major issues of today, the shortlisted museums may operate at very different scales, but all show astonishing ambition and boundless creativity. Each is a blueprint for future innovation in museums.” During the two world wars of the last century, thousands of people went to build and work on the naval base at Lyness on Hoy. The Scapa Flow Museum tells the stories of individuals as well as charting historic events, such as internment, and the scuttling and salvage of the German high seas fleet in 1919. The redevelopment incorporated part of the base’s infrastructure, the former fuel oil pumping station. The museum is a significant tourist attraction on the island, which has a permanent population of 400. The Burrell Collection houses 9,000 objects collected by Sir William and Constance Burrell, including one of the UK’s most significant holdings of Chinese art, some of the world’s finest medieval stained glass and tapestries, and paintings by artists including Rembrandt and Degas. It reopened to the public in Glasgow last March after a six-year refurbishment that cost £68m and was funded by Glasgow city council, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the Scottish and UK governments. The collection was originally donated to the City of Glasgow in 1944 on the proviso that it be housed in a rural setting. Leighton House is the former studio and home of the leading Victorian artist Frederic Leighton, which has been a museum since 1900. Recently it has worked with contemporary artists to create works of art that resonate with the influences of the house, including furniture made by displaced Syrian artisans. The MAC is Northern Ireland’s leading arts centre, bringing major international artists to a local audience, while displaying the work of Northern Irish artists in an international context. Its MACtivate programme works with marginalised people, allowing the museum to reach beyond traditional arts audiences. The Natural History Museum is a world-leading science research centre as well as the most-visited indoor attraction in the UK. Its scientific collections comprise more than 80m specimens, and its 350 scientists work on issues such as biodiversity loss and the sustainable extraction of natural resources. It was famously the home of Dippy, which became the first diplodocus to go on display in the world in 1905, until 2017. The museum was criticised recently for agreeing to a gagging clause preventing it from criticising the oil company that sponsored its wildlife photography competition, as well as for hosting an event for the Saudi embassy in London in 2018 – amid the global outrage over the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s consulate in Istanbul. The 2022 winner of the award was the Horniman Museum and Gardens in south London. This year’s winner will be announced on 12 July and will receive £120,000, with £15,000 going to each of the other finalists. Alongside Waldman, the panel also includes the artist Larry Achiampong, the historian and broadcaster Dame Mary Beard, as well as the author Abadesi Osunsade, and Laura Pye, the director of National Museums Liverpool. The judges will visit each of the finalists to inform their decision-making, while each museum will make the most of being shortlisted over the summer through events and activities for new and current visitors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/naacp-florida-travel-warning-ron-desantis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:29:33Z","webTitle":"NAACP says Florida is ‘actively hostile’ to minorities and issues travel warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/naacp-florida-travel-warning-ron-desantis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/naacp-florida-travel-warning-ron-desantis","fields":{"headline":"NAACP says Florida is ‘actively hostile’ to minorities and issues travel warning","bodyText":"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel advisory for the state of Florida, calling the state “actively hostile” to minorities as Florida’s conservative government limits diversity efforts in schools. In a Saturday press release, the civil rights organization better known as the NAACP said the travel warning comes as Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, “attempts to erase Black history and to restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Florida schools”. “Before traveling to Florida, please understand that the state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by African Americans and other communities of color,” the advisory said. Under DeSantis, Florida’s department of education has restricted classroom material covering race, gender, sexuality and other identities. The state’s education department has also prohibited mathematics textbooks and other material for a range of reasons, including alleged inclusion of critical race theory. DeSantis last week signed legislation banning diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public colleges and universities. In January, Florida rejected an advanced placement (AP) course in African American studies by the College Board, the company that oversees AP classes that can be used for college credit and standardized testing in the US. DeSantis said the proposed course violated Florida’s ban on “critical race theory”, signed by DeSantis last year, and “lacked educational value”. Critics say that such laws supported by DeSantis are discriminatory and a threat to democracy. “Let me be clear – failing to teach an accurate representation of the horrors and inequalities that Black Americans have faced and continue to face is a disservice to students and a dereliction of duty to all,” the NAACP’s president, Derrick Johnson, said in the advisory. Prof Kimberlé Crenshaw is a leading voice and scholar of critical race theory, which explores systemic racism within US legal institutions. Crenshaw was one of several authors and academics edited out of the College Board’s AP African American studies course amid Florida’s rejection of the course. Crenshaw told the Guardian in a March interview that laws against Black history in Florida and elsewhere were the “tip of the iceberg” of conservative efforts to roll back progressivism and push the US towards authoritarianism. “Are [schools] on the side of the neo-segregationist faction? Or are [they] going to stick with the commitments that we’ve all celebrated for the last 50, 60 years?” asked Crenshaw, referring to progress made on equal opportunities since the 1960s. “The College Board fiasco, I think, is just the tip of the iceberg. There are a lot of interests that have to make this decision,” she said. Other groups have also warned against travel to Florida. Equality Florida, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, issued a travel advisory in April because of laws targeting LGBTQ+ rights, the Washington Post reported. In a separate advisory, the Florida Immigrant Coalition said “traveling to Florida is dangerous”, warning that people of color, international travelers and those with an accent faced a higher risk of racial profiling and harassment. The NAACP previously issued travel warnings in 2017 for Missouri over the death of a Black man in a jail and racist threats going unchecked on college campuses in that state, Time reported. Black drivers in Missouri were also stopped 75% more than white drivers, according to a 2016 report from the state attorney general’s office that the advisory referenced. The Guardian could not reach a DeSantis spokesperson for immediate comment. But DeSantis’s press secretary, Jeremy Redfern, responded to the NAACP travel advisory announcement on Twitter, the Post reported. Redfern replied to the announcement with a gif of DeSantis saying: “This is a stunt. If you want to waste your time on a stunt, that’s fine. But I’m not wasting my time on your stunts. OK?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/weed-spliced-concrete-block-at-flower-show-highlights-green-space-disparities-in-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:23:19Z","webTitle":"Weed-spliced concrete block at flower show highlights green space disparities in Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/weed-spliced-concrete-block-at-flower-show-highlights-green-space-disparities-in-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/weed-spliced-concrete-block-at-flower-show-highlights-green-space-disparities-in-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Weed-spliced concrete block at flower show highlights green space disparities in Chelsea","bodyText":"Alongside displays of bright flowers and cutting-edge garden design, visitors at this year’s Chelsea flower show will find an exhibition featuring native weeds and plants. The display, which is part of the smallest garden ever shown at the event, has been designed by the guerrilla gardening group Grow2Know, to bring attention to the disparity of green space in the borough. According to publicly available data gathered by the urban planning and design practice Prior and Partners, people in Notting Dale, the North Kensington ward where Grenfell is situated, have access to only 41.66 sq metres of green space – the equivalent of three parking bays – within a 1km radius. Those in the neighbouring South Kensington ward of Queen’s Gate have access to 2,149 sq metres. The Grow2Know plot at this year’s show, called The Green Gap, is 4.2 sq metres, a 1:10 scale representation of the green space available to some of those living in Notting Dale. Tayshan Hayden-Smith, the founder of Grow2Know and a footballer who was born in North Kensington, described the display as “a visual representation of the stark reality of inequality within the borough”. He said: “As an organisation that strongly believes everyone should have equal access to green space, we are dedicated to driving and inspiring change, and we’ll make it our mission to make gardening more inclusive and naturally accessible to all through ongoing community-driven gardening projects and education.” Encased in concrete, the exhibition brings together dandelions, thyme and chamomile, all of which residents can expect to find growing in their streets, just a stone’s throw away from the Chelsea flower show venue. The project follows Hayden-Smith’s Hands Off Mangrove display at the flower show last year, which centred on a 4-metre tall, deforested mangrove sculpture with nine bare roots, each one honouring a member of the Mangrove Nine group of black activists whose trial in the 1970s exposed racial bias in the police. The sculpture doubled up as a protective canopy, under which people could gather in the garden’s second life in the North Kensington area, while the garden featured edible plants to encourage horticulture. Hayden-Smith has since been appointed as a Royal Horticultural Society ambassador for young people and communities. Grow2Know was formed in response to the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, as a way to promote collective healing, to reclaim space and to reconnect people in the community. Based in North Kensington, the grassroots non-profit has collaborated with local people and schools to put community at the forefront in the creation of public outdoor spaces. The group is responsible for the Grenfell Peace Garden and has collaborated with Penguin and the Natural History Museum to develop more green spaces in west London. It says it is also committed to pushing for more sustainable systems that promote biodiversity, circular economies and regenerative practices. Grow2Know’s garden will be exhibited at the RHS Chelsea flower show from 23–27 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:21:30Z","webTitle":"Russia tightens grip on Bakhmut in face of Ukraine counterattacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","fields":{"headline":"Russia tightens grip on Bakhmut in face of Ukraine counterattacks","bodyText":"Russia appeared close to taking control of Bakhmut on Monday, although Ukraine said it continued to fight on in the south-west fringes of the city largely devastated by an intense year of deadly fighting. Hanna Mailar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine still controlled “certain facilities” in the Litak district, but reports said the defenders had lost control of the last of the remaining high-rises in the eastern Ukrainian city. Ukraine has switched its primary focus to engaging in limited counterattacks on the higher ground to the immediate north-west and south of the ruined city, which could be used to threaten the Russian attackers below. “The offensive potential of the enemy has been significantly reduced, huge losses have been inflicted on the enemy” Mailar said. She added: “We have gained time for certain actions, which will be discussed later.” Bakhmut was first shelled in May 2022 and Russian forces consistently targeted the mining city that had a pre-war population of about 70,000. Although not considered of particular strategic value, the city has acquired a high symbolic value for both sides in the conflict. The two sides fought building by building in the most intense fighting seen in Europe since the end of the second world war, with Russia taking a year to advance about 24km on the Bakhmut sector of the eastern Donbas, a front that has otherwise remained relatively static since last autumn. The effort was led by the Russian mercenary Wagner group, using seasoned veterans to command a large number of former prisoners. But experts question whether, as the battle draws to an end, Wagner can continue to fight further. The Institute of the Study of War said on Sunday night it believed Wagner’s offensive was likely to be at its culmination point and that “it is unlikely that Wagner will continue fighting beyond Bakhmut at its current depleted state”. Joe Biden, the US president, said at the G7 summit in Japan that Russia had suffered 100,000 casualties, killed and wounded, in fighting for the city, higher than previous Ukrainian estimates of 70,000. Ukraine does not release casualty figures but it is believed to have lost tens of thousands in the protracted struggle. Wagner’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declared on Saturday that Bakhmut had fallen, filming himself at the city’s battered railway station a few kilometres behind the frontline. Other video footage showed Russian troops waving flags at the western edge of the city, although not in the Litak district still being fought over. At that point, Prigozhin announced Wagner forces would withdraw from the city by Thursday, leaving its defence to regular Russian troops, although it was unclear whether that was a firm declaration of intent, or a feint designed to lure Ukrainian forces back into attacking the city. Attacking forces are often considered at their most vulnerable when an advance culminates, usually due to combat exhaustion, and Ukraine has been hinting that it hopes to surround the invaders in the city by attacking to the north and south. But the Ukrainian counterattacks remain relatively limited so far, and the expectation is that Kyiv will soon launch a more significant assault as the weather improves, using about 12 brigades-worth of troops, many of which have been equipped with western tanks, fighting vehicles and artillery. Three civilians were killed and 14 injured across Ukraine in overnight shelling while the country’s air force said it had shot down four cruise missiles and 20 drones. But the air force spokesperson Yuri Inhat said Ukraine did not “have enough means” – air defences – to deal with high-speed ballistic missiles across the country. Ukraine said it had reconnected the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to its external power supply after a brief outage that had left it reliant on emergency generators. Backup diesel generators were in use for a time at the site, to ensure nuclear fuel was kept cool and prevent a potential disaster. It is the seventh time during the war that the nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest, has had to switch to backup power. Russian forces seized the plant early in the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/may/22/english-water-firms-sewage-spills-mistakes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:16:02Z","webTitle":"English water firms want to draw a line under the past.

It won’t wash","bodyText":"“We want to be held to account …” said Ruth Kelly, the new public face of the English water companies, last week, briefly raising hopes of a moment of reckoning for the industry’s past (and current) sewage spills. Then the chair of Water UK clarified what her version of accountability covers. The companies wish to be held to account “… for putting it right”. The past 30 years, we were invited to think, should be considered an unfortunate chapter in which the industry, terribly unfortunately, didn’t give sewage spills enough attention while other investments were prioritised. That was the gist of her apology. “By and large, the water companies were carrying out their legal responsibilities but … what’s legal is not necessarily the right answer or what people expect,” she argued on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. One trusts this “by and large” claim provoked spluttering among officials at the Environment Agency and Ofwat. As Kelly must know, both regulatory bodies have been engaged for the past 18 months in an inquiry to determine whether the industry was, in essence, not treating as much sewage as it should have been at 2,000-plus treatment plants. Whether legal duties were met is very much a live question. Ofwat and the EA are understandably tight-lipped on details until any enforcement action is decided – the EA has powers of criminal prosecution and Ofwat can impose penalties worth 10% of turnover. But here’s what David Black, Ofwat’s chief executive, said last June when South West Water was added to the list of companies under specific investigation. “From what we have seen so far, the scale of the issue here is shocking.” The rest of list comprises Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water – so six of the nine big firms in total. Should Thames, the biggest company, be found guilty, that could mean a fine of £218m based on last year’s £2.2bn turnover. One got another flavour at what’s at stake when Jonson Cox, who retired as chair of Ofwat last summer, gave evidence to a House of Lords committee in September. Concern around the operation of wastewater treatment works dated back to 2015, he said, but came to a head in October 2021 when data from a rollout of new monitors started to arrive. “We were absolutely dismayed by that information,” he told the Lords. More explosively, he suggested companies probably knew about non-compliance with permits before 2021. “Did companies not know anything about this? I do not find that credible,” said Cox. “I find it interesting that as the rollout reached a critical scale the data was put on the table.” This investigation goes to the heart of financial incentives in the water industry: whether it’s just been easier (and lucrative) to allow sewage to spill into rivers than to do the difficult and expensive job of treating it. In follow-up written testimony, Cox hinted that the industry – now attuned to the public mood, according to Kelly – has reacted to the biggest post-privatisation investigation by reaching for its lawyers. “Rather than spend months and years contesting the enforcement action the regulators have under way, companies with widespread and systemic breaches need to show that they understand how and why they went wrong and get into compliance fast, and no later than by 2025,” he advised. As they contemplate Kelly’s less-than-generous offer to have £10bn added to their bills, customers might digest three of Cox’s other points. First, the former regulator said the problem with storm overflows was “not just ‘investment’, as is so often cited by companies”. Nearly a third of breaches resulted from inadequate maintenance of sewers, he said – maintenance that the companies must certify to Ofwat every year that they can sustain to legal standards. “If they don’t believe they have the resources to do their job, they should have appealed,” he said. Second, on the question of who should pay for improvement, he offered a simple formula: where companies have breached legal requirements or failed to ensure an effective sewerage and wastewater treatment system, “it is for companies and their shareholders to fund and put the problem right”. The elements that get factored into bills are where new standards are required. Third, an important technical point: since the value of companies’ assets is indexed to inflation, a form of windfall gain is now being enjoyed. “It would seem not unreasonable,” Cox said, to expect companies to share this gain and absorb some financial pain themselves. That is the context in which to view Kelly’s pitch for £10bn-worth of customer-funded investment. There is no reason for Ofwat to accept it on behalf of customers until investments that should have happened in the past have been 100% recovered from corporate pockets. A couple of the more far-sighted chief executives in the sector, it should be said, accept as much; they predict fresh equity injections by shareholders at some firms to get the £10bn plan rolling. Yet the official Kelly and Water UK narrative contained no hint of financial compromise or even mention of the major on-going regulatory inquiry. Instead, it read as an attempt to draw a line under the past and move on. That won’t wash. Accountability must also be backward-looking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/may/22/eddie-izzard-meera-syal-sanjeev-bhaskar-terrified-kumars-at-no-42","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:09:26Z","webTitle":"‘Eddie Izzard was too terrified to come on!’ How we made The Kumars at No 42","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/22/eddie-izzard-meera-syal-sanjeev-bhaskar-terrified-kumars-at-no-42","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/may/22/eddie-izzard-meera-syal-sanjeev-bhaskar-terrified-kumars-at-no-42","fields":{"headline":"‘Eddie Izzard was too terrified to come on!’ How we made The Kumars at No 42","bodyText":"Sanjeev Bhaskar, creator and actor Just before Goodness Gracious Me started, I came up with a chatshow where a family interviews famous guests. It was partly inspired by me thinking, “I wonder if I’ll meet anyone famous now I’m doing this?” – and also by the time I introduced my university girlfriend to my parents. My dad said: “Pleased to meet you, how much does your father earn?” Then my mum stepped in with: “Welcome Janet. It’s lovely to meet you … Sanjeev has always been terrible at dealing with rejection.” That was the first 30 seconds. I started thinking: “If I took someone famous home to meet my parents, it would be exactly the same.” Despite our success with Goodness Gracious Me, it took a really long time to get the show going. Commissioners just didn’t get it. But when it started, it was phenomenal. Unlike other chatshows, we deliberately didn’t prep the guests, as we wanted them to be themselves. So much of the show was improvised and we just had no idea what the guests were going to say or do. We had people like Cilla Black, Alan Alda, Donny Osmond, Ray Winstone, Richard E Grant – it was a joy. When we had Tom Jones on, Meera, who was playing the granny, went over, hugged him, and decided she was going to just cling on – beyond the point of comfort. It was great seeing Tom not knowing what to do – would he prise her off? He ended up looking very awkward before going: “Everything all right down there?” By the second or third series, we were Bafta-nominated. We won two International Emmies in two consecutive years, a Peabody and a bronze Rose of Montreux. I do think it’s a shame Meera didn’t win something, though. She created one of the best comic characters I’ve ever seen on TV. When we were trying to convince Eddie Izzard to come on the show, he said: “The grandmother absolutely terrifies me!” So I pointed at Meera and he turns to her and says: “The grandmother absolutely terrifies me!” I had to say: “No, Meera IS the grandmother.” He had no idea. The show travelled around the world. It did well in America, Asia, South Africa, was huge in Australia and New Zealand. A few years ago, I did a Unicef trip and at Johannesburg airport a couple came up to me and said: “Excuse me, are you the guy from The Kumars?” That was extraordinary – it was years after! Meera Syal, actor Initially, they didn’t want me to play the granny. But they struggled to find Asian women in the right age group who could improvise. There was a bit of me that thought: “Do I really want to be playing someone three times my age?” But I thought the show sounded brilliant, and I love improvisation so much that it was a no-brainer. I don’t know if I’ll ever be offered another part with so much creative freedom and joy. The shows had a structure, which you hung your little storylines on and improvised around. It was a bit like jazz – you have to know the melody so you can wander off it. We got so used to each others’ rhythms, we developed an artistic telepathy. I could feel Sanj cueing something up and I thought: “I know where he wants me to go.” I loved working like that. Sanj had a clear idea for the granny. He very much wanted her to be the gobby, rebellious wildcard to push against that image everybody had of older women – especially older south Asian women. Also, he knew that an old Indian woman can get away with being flirty, or naughty, or saying the unsayable. We really did try to push things as far as we could, but I think we got away with a lot because we we were never cruel to guests. We gave them an Indian family’s idea of hospitality – to love them to death – and we were genuinely really excited to have them on the show. We got to meet our childhood heroes. Donny Osmond was a big moment for me. You don’t ever expect to meet the person whose face you used to kiss on your bedroom wall. Even if it was as an 85-year-old woman with bad teeth. The only downside was my back. I used to bend double to play her, and after the first few episodes, I said: “Guys, forget about me bending double for any of the rehearsals, because this is killing me.” Also, during the series, me and Sanj became a couple in real life, and ended up having a child. I had to be very careful with all the bending when I was pregnant. I had regular massages to help. Overall, I’m just so proud that we managed to lavish so many famous people with Punjabi hospitality, and I love that we got all these famous people to spill their guts in a really unusual way. It was wonderful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:01:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 453 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 453 of the invasion","bodyText":"Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory in Belgorod has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the electricity grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators were used. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit at the weekend. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/22/mp-margaret-ferrier-loses-appeal-over-commons-ban-for-covid-rule-breaches","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:56:51Z","webTitle":"MP Margaret Ferrier loses appeal over Commons ban for Covid rule breaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/mp-margaret-ferrier-loses-appeal-over-commons-ban-for-covid-rule-breaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/mp-margaret-ferrier-loses-appeal-over-commons-ban-for-covid-rule-breaches","fields":{"headline":"MP Margaret Ferrier loses appeal over Commons ban for Covid rule breaches","bodyText":"Margaret Ferrier has lost her appeal against a proposed 30-day ban from the House of Commons over Covid rule breaches, paving the way for a byelection in the MP’s Scottish constituency. The former Scottish National party MP was found to have damaged the reputation of the Commons and put people at risk after taking part in a debate and travelling by train while she had Covid in September 2020. The failure of her appeal could trigger a recall petition in her Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency, where a byelection would provide Labour with an opportunity to contest a seat in Scotland, where it hopes to make gains in the general election. The seat was won by the SNP in 2019 and by Labour in 2017, and would be a crucial electoral test for Scotland’s new first minister, Humza Yousaf, whose party has been mired in financial scandal and personal clashes. Any suspension of 10 or more working days automatically triggers a recall petition, which, if signed by 10% of constituents, leads to a byelection. The length of the Ferrier’s suspension alarmed backers of Boris Johnson, who is being investigated by the privileges committee about breaches of Covid rules in Downing Street. He hopes to avoid a similar lengthy sanction, which may prompt a byelection in his Uxbridge seat. An independent expert panel on Monday dismissed Ferrier’s appeal, stating that it had “no substance” after the Commons standards committee recommended her suspension in March. “The first stage of the appeal process has not been met. The sanction imposed was neither unreasonable nor disproportionate. For these reasons, this appeal is dismissed.” Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, Jackie Baillie, said a byelection had moved “one step closer” in the constituency, where the party already has a candidate in Michael Shanks, a modern studies teacher who lives locally. “It is simply disgraceful that this community has been left without proper representation due to the actions of Margaret Ferrier,” said Baillie. Shanks would provide its constituents with “the clean start that they deserve,” she said. The SNP said it was “ready to take the fight to the Tories and pro-Brexit Labour party” but has been struggling to find a suitable candidate to contest the byelection. Yousaf has been trying to find a candidate after refusing to endorse any of the three local councillors who put themselves forward. The SNP’s opponents assume no one in the party would want to fight the seat given the high probability they would lose, and have to spend much of the contest fending off palpable anger locally over Ferrier’s behaviour. Ferrier, who lost the SNP whip, was sentenced to 270 hours of community service after pleading guilty to breaching Covid rules. In September 2020, she took a Covid test after developing symptoms but the next day attended church and had lunch with a family member. Two days later, while awaiting the results of a Covid test, she travelled by train to London, took part in a parliamentary debate and ate in the members’ tearoom. She then travelled home to Glasgow by train the next morningdespite being told she had tested positive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/republicans-debt-ceiling-marjorie-taylor-greene-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:53:28Z","webTitle":"Debt ceiling showdowns aren’t new – but this time gonzo Republicans are ready to blow up the economy | Robert Reich","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/republicans-debt-ceiling-marjorie-taylor-greene-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/republicans-debt-ceiling-marjorie-taylor-greene-economy","fields":{"headline":"Debt ceiling showdowns aren’t new – but this time gonzo Republicans are ready to blow up the economy","bodyText":"On 22 October 1985, the treasury secretary, James A Baker III, told congressional leaders that if Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling by the end of the month, the Reagan administration would pay the nation’s bills by taking back treasury securities in which social security had invested. It was an extraordinary move. Under Baker’s plan, social security would lose interest on its funds. If Congress still didn’t raise the debt ceiling, the administration would borrow from the railroad retirement and military retirement trust funds. If the impasse continued, it would begin selling gold from the US gold reserve “even though that could undercut confidence here and abroad based on the widespread belief that the gold reserve is the foundation of our financial system”, said Baker. An agreement was reached after the Reagan administration had begun raiding social security, but before it took any other measures. The comptroller general of the United States later found Baker’s raid on social security technically illegal but concluded nonetheless that Baker “did not act unreasonably” under the circumstances. I recount this history to give you some perspective on the current debt-ceiling crisis. First, showdowns over the debt ceiling have been going on for a long time. Second, they have often been fueled by soaring national debts due to Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations. The 1985 standoff involved a refusal by Senate Democrats to support a balanced budget, even though it was Reagan’s mammoth spending on the military and huge tax cut that had doubled the national debt in less than five years. Finally, they have required Treasury secretaries to do extraordinary things to keep paying the nation’s bills notwithstanding, sometimes technically illegal. Hence, there have never been “X-dates” at which time the treasury runs dry. There are just ever more extreme government bookkeeping measures. But here’s the difference this time. Previous standoffs have been carefully crafted dramas in which both sides demonstrate their commitments to their position, knowing full well how the play will end – with the debt ceiling lifted. This time, though, gonzo lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene and nihilists like the current Republican frontrunner for president have considerable influence. And unlike Bob Dole in 1985, these players have no real commitment to cutting the government debt. (Were that their goal, presumably they wouldn’t have supported the massive 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations that fueled the debt, or would now urge its repeal. And they certainly wouldn’t demand cuts in staffing for the IRS, which House Republicans are also now doing.) Their only commitment is to power – gaining dominance over, and submission from, Democrats, progressives, putative “coastal elites” and so-called “deep state” bureaucrats. For them, this is not play-acting. It’s not for show. It’s for real. If they don’t get their way, they’re prepared to blow up the economy. In fact, as the so-called X-date looms ever closer, their demands have only escalated. Which is why it’s critical for Biden to continue paying the government’s bills and for the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, to continue using every bookkeeping scheme imaginable to find the means to pay those bills. They must never declare an “X-date”, and never default. If Kevin McCarthy and his band of radicals don’t like this, let them take the Biden administration to court. Let House Republicans argue in the courts that the 1917 act establishing the debt ceiling has precedence over section 4 of the 14th amendment, which requires that the “the validity of the public debt …. shall not be questioned.” Let them claim that the debt-ceiling act takes precedence over other acts of Congress that require the president, for example, to pay interest on the federal debt, distribute social security benefits, and pay bills from defense contractors and everyone else who has relied on the full faith and credit of the United States. Let McCarthy and House Republicans make the case before the courts that they have standing to sue Biden for paying the government’s debts as they come due. Finally, let McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the other loonies demand openly and publicly in court that Biden not honor the full faith and credit of the United States – with the predictable results that the cost of borrowing soars, bond markets crash, the stock market plummets, the global economy is in turmoil, the dollar’s status as the world’s major currency is up for grabs, America is plunged into a deep recession, and millions of jobs are lost. In other words, leave it to McCarthy and House Republicans to seek to enforce their dangerous nonsense about the debt ceiling – so Americans can see clearly what they’re up to.

I thought he was an unbelievable player in 2018-2019 and he has got stronger.” Injury was Koepka’s problem during much of the intervening period, leading to fears he may even have to step away from top-level golf. “That really affected him,” Cowen said. “You can’t swing the way you want to when your fitness is poor. “I believed he could come back because he has always been comfortable in uncomfortable situations. He looks as though he is going to beat you now, when he is coming down the stretch. He is not frightened of working, that’s for sure, and he couldn’t work when he was injured.” Koepka, who tied for second in the Masters, will rise to second in the automatic qualifying places for the US Ryder Cup team. While it would seem extraordinary if he did not at least receive a captain’s pick for the September meeting with Europe in Rome, Koepka’s position as part of the rebel LIV tour adds an element of doubt. “He would love to play in the Ryder Cup,” Cowen said. “I know Brooks – and Dustin Johnson – would love to play. I have spoken to them about it.” A tongue-in-cheek comment followed, in reference to the PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan. “I don’t think Jay would like him to play,” Cowen said. The Ryder Cup is, however, a PGA of America rather than PGA Tour concern. Asked about the significance of a LIV golfer winning a major Koepka said: “Yeah, it’s a huge thing, but at the same time I’m out here competing as an individual at the PGA Championship.” Cowen walked with Koepka between Oak Hill’s pitching and putting areas before the final round. “He was complaining about swinging poorly,” Cowen said. “I said to him: ‘Your 70% will still win.’” Cowen has just one memento from Koepka major wins, a signed flag given to him after the 2017 US Open at Erin Hills. “I sat him down after watching him play all four rounds at the St Jude Classic,” the 72-year-old Yorkshireman said. “I gave him a real talking to, said to him: ‘With that attitude, you’ll win nothing. Your talent is there but your attitude is appalling. You have to have the attitude of a champion if you are going to be a champion.’ “On the flag it says: ‘Thanks for the bollocking. I couldn’t have done it without you.’ He can take that from me, he doesn’t want a ‘yes’ man or his ego stroked.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2023/may/22/chancellor-jeremy-hunt-reprimanded-over-falsely-implying-uk-public-debt-forecast-to-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:51:10Z","webTitle":"Officials warned over accuracy after Jeremy Hunt tweet on public debt ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/22/chancellor-jeremy-hunt-reprimanded-over-falsely-implying-uk-public-debt-forecast-to-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/22/chancellor-jeremy-hunt-reprimanded-over-falsely-implying-uk-public-debt-forecast-to-fall","fields":{"headline":"Officials warned over accuracy after Jeremy Hunt tweet on public debt ","bodyText":"The official statistics watchdog has reprimanded the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, after he claimed public debt levels would fall in the coming years, when in fact they are simply forecast to rise less steeply than previously expected. The head of the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA), Sir Robert Chote, said the watchdog’s regulatory arm had spoken to Treasury officials to warn them about accuracy after a complaint by the Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle over a tweet the chancellor sent on 25 April. Saying the government had “made progress” on the public finances, Hunt wrote: “By 2027-28, headline debt levels are reduced by £53.7 billion.” Eagle, a former Treasury minister who sits on the Treasury committee, wrote to Chote, noting that the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts indicate that public debt will rise between now and 2027-28, including a £90bn increase from 2026-27 alone. She said Hunt appeared to be referring to a fall in the OBR’s current projection for headline debt in 2027-28 compared with the same forecast in last year’s autumn statement. Eagle wrote: “I am concerned that government ministers are using misleading statistics publicly regarding the economy, and believe it is critical that figures used are accurate.” In a reply, Chote said Treasury officials had confirmed this was what the tweet referred to: a reduction in the size of the forecast increase of debt, not a fall in the debt itself. “As you suggest, some readers of the tweet may have assumed that the chancellor was referring to the forecast change in public sector net debt between the last full financial year and 2027-28,” he wrote. “Greater clarity and context would have avoided this confusion. The Office for Statistics Regulation [the regulatory arm of the UKSA] has therefore spoken with officials at HM Treasury to emphasise the importance of consistently adopting a transparent and accessible approach to communicating statistics and data in line with our guidance on intelligent transparency.” Eagle told the Guardian: “As the statistics authority has confirmed, this government has a persistently troubled relationship with the truth – one that is becoming increasingly obvious if you read the fine print. “It is incredibly disappointing to see the chancellor resorting to using such misleading statistics in a tweet of all places – a new low for the fourth chancellor in a year.” The Treasury confirmed Hunt’s tweet had referred to the changing forecast for the debt increase, and that it had noted Chote’s points and would take any necessary action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/inappropriate-for-braverman-to-ask-for-one-to-one-speed-course-says-motoring-solicitor","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:50:42Z","webTitle":"‘Inappropriate’ for Braverman to ask for one-to-one speed course, says motoring solicitor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/inappropriate-for-braverman-to-ask-for-one-to-one-speed-course-says-motoring-solicitor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/inappropriate-for-braverman-to-ask-for-one-to-one-speed-course-says-motoring-solicitor","fields":{"headline":"‘Inappropriate’ for Braverman to ask for one-to-one speed course, says motoring solicitor","bodyText":"Speed awareness course providers have previously organised one-to-one sessions for high-profile motoring offenders but it would be “wholly inappropriate” to do this for Suella Braverman, a lawyer has claimed. The Manchester-based solicitor Nick Freeman, who earned the nickname Mr Loophole for successfully defending numerous celebrity clients accused of motoring offences, says he has arranged speeding courses for individuals “several times with several providers”. Freeman said while it was possible and legal for an individual such as the home secretary to ask if a private course was available, he believed it would be inappropriate for a politician. In a development first reported by the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday, it was alleged that Braverman sought help from Home Office civil servants to try to avoid attending an in-person speed awareness course after being caught speeding, or doing an online course where her name and face would be visible to other participants. Such courses are made available to drivers who have narrowly broken the speed limit and have not already completed a course within the last three years. They are provided by private firms such as Drivetech, which is part of the AA, and TTC Group. Freeman, a motoring law specialist whose clients have included David Beckham, Alex Ferguson, Andrew Flintoff and Jeremy Clarkson, said a private course was not possible for everyone. “It’s for a very tiny minority of people whose presence would cause such a distraction it would dilute the purpose of the course,” he said. “There’s nothing online about it. I’ve arranged these courses on a one-to-one basis for several clients and have actually been approached on one particular occasion by a course provider who asked me if my client would be willing to have a one-to-one. “The idea of the course is that it’s instructive and you don’t want to be there thinking ‘Oh wow, look at him or her’. So it’s not publicised, it’s not widely known.” Freeman said he had no idea how common it was to hold one-to-one courses but he had organised it several times. He continued: “I have had a case for a certain individual, whose case went to court, and I managed to get it reversed, because there had been administrative problems not of his own making. I got it reversed, got him on a course, got him on a one-to-one.” Freeman would not provide the names of specific providers who had agreed to one-to-one courses. The Guardian has contacted course providers and is awaiting comment. On Braverman, he said: “Would she be entitled to one? If I was a course provider I’d say absolutely not. She’s a politician, elected, it would be wholly inappropriate for her to do it but there is nothing wrong with her asking the question. “What she should have done is come straight out when she was attorney general, held her hands up, she would have won some points by saying ‘I’ve been done for speeding, I’m thoroughly ashamed, I’m sorry, I’m going to do a course that makes me a better and safer driver’. “Why don’t politicians behave in a way that they should do – they behave like politicians don’t they? This is why the public is so disenfranchised.” Braverman has insisted that “nothing untoward happened”. On Monday, she confirmed she had accepted a fine and points on her licence for speeding last summer but denied any wrongdoing over the ministerial code. “What I will say is that in my view I am confident that nothing untoward happened,” she said after being repeatedly pressed on the issue in a brief television interview."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/may/22/insulin-costs-almost-a-months-wages-in-poorer-countries","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:43:21Z","webTitle":"Insulin costs almost a month’s wages in poorer countries, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/22/insulin-costs-almost-a-months-wages-in-poorer-countries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/may/22/insulin-costs-almost-a-months-wages-in-poorer-countries","fields":{"headline":"Insulin costs almost a month’s wages in poorer countries, says study","bodyText":"Diabetics in poorer countries are spending on average 10 times more of their income on insulin than people in wealthier states, according to a new survey. A month’s worth of insulin costs up to 27 days’ salary in Cameroon and 20 days in Nigeria and Myanmar, according to a survey of prices at pharmacies in 47 countries. In upper-middle-income countries, insulin costs an average of four days’ wages. The snapshot study by the NGO Health Action International was based on glargine: a long-acting insulin used by type 1 diabetics. It comes on the first anniversary, this week, of a pledge made at the World Health Assembly to ensure all type 1 diabetics had affordable access to insulin and blood glucose-monitoring materials. The NGO measured the cost of 1,000 units of insulin – roughly a month’s supply – against the wage earned by a country’s lowest-paid unskilled government worker, a measure often used to judge affordability of medicines. Dr Marg Ewen, who led the project, said a month’s worth of insulin should not cost more than one day’s wages. “What people need is medicines to be available and affordable. Affordability is an issue because people have to pay out of pocket and, of course, they don’t have high incomes. “If you’ve got to work over one day a month for a month’s supply then that would be unaffordable because there can be other people in the family who have to have medicines paid for, or the person living with diabetes could have comorbidities where other medicines have to be purchased as well.” The WHA resolution was made 100 years after human insulin was developed and injected to treat diabetes. The scientists who developed it protected it from being patented, intending for it to remain affordable. However, modern synthetic insulin is patented by a few companies, which have been criticised for charging high prices. While insulin was most expensive in the US, where it costs $172 (£138) for 1,000 units, it cost $120 in Lebanon, $77 in Ethiopia and more than $40 in Cameroon, Nigeria and Myanmar. Insulin bought through the private sector was cheaper in several high-income countries, including Denmark, Norway, Belgium and France. In Australia, insulin cost $16. A lack of transparency on insulin-procurement costs makes it difficult to know why prices are widely different, but added costs along the supply chain from importers, distributors and retailers, as well as sales taxes, will be factors. Cyrine Farhat, who has type 1 diabetes and is the founder of the Lebanon-based advocacy group Positive on Glucose, said the country’s economic crisis has made insulin unaffordable for many people. “Some people still get paid about $200 a month. So, this is a very big chunk of a person’s salary, sometimes 100% of the person’s salary, sometimes 50%, and sometimes 1,000%,” she said. Farhat buys her insulin from a company that imports medicine from Turkey, costing her about $400 a month, which she can only afford because she works for an international not-for-profit organisation. She said the cost is made worse because the health system is mostly privatised, forcing people to pay for basic services needed to manage the condition. “I know people who have to choose, do they put food on the table or do they buy insulin for their children? Of course, there are people who are insulin rationing and I know individuals who will totally depend on donations,” she said. Elizabeth Pfiester, the executive director of advocacy group T1International, said the goal should be for blood glucose-testing equipment and insulin to be 5% of median income. “Insulin is as essential as water for people with type 1 diabetes. If we don’t have it, we will die. It’s as simple as that,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/eu-calls-for-independent-inquiry-greece-pushback-asylum-seekers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:43:13Z","webTitle":"EU calls for independent inquiry into Greece ‘pushback’ of asylum seekers ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/eu-calls-for-independent-inquiry-greece-pushback-asylum-seekers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/eu-calls-for-independent-inquiry-greece-pushback-asylum-seekers","fields":{"headline":"EU calls for independent inquiry into Greece ‘pushback’ of asylum seekers ","bodyText":"EU authorities have called on Greece to conduct an independent investigation into video footage that purports to show the forced expulsion of asylum seekers from its territory. In a statement on Twitter released the day after Greek elections, the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said her officials had written to Athens with a formal request “that this incident be fully and independently investigated”. She recalled a meeting she held with the Greek government a year ago when she “made clear that there [was] no place for illegal deportations” and said the European Commission was ready to take “formal steps, as appropriate” without elaborating. The video footage, filmed by an Austrian activist on Lesbos and published by the New York Times last Friday, shows 12 people – men, women and children – being taken out of a van on the island, before being towed out to sea and abandoned on an inflatable raft. The paper subsequently interviewed 11 of the asylum seekers at a detention centre in Izmir on the Turkish coast and used the coordinates of other vessels to verify the footage. “We didn’t expect to survive on that day,” Naima Hassan Aden, a 27-year-old from Somalia, who was forced out of Greece with her six-month-old baby, told the paper. “When they were putting us on the inflatable raft, they did so without any mercy.” The Greek government, which did not immediately comment on the video, has insisted its migration policy is tough, but fair. The prime minister, Kyriákos Mitsotákis, who on Sunday beat the leftwing opposition, but fell short of an absolute majority, last week said he had protected his country’s borders at land and sea. A European Commission spokesperson rejected suggestions that the incident had been fuelled by remarks, three years ago, by its president, Ursula von der Leyen, who said Greece was Europe’s “shield” in deterring migrants. The spokesperson said the commission had been unable to identify whether reports in the New York Times that the boat was paid for by EU funds was accurate. The Greek government has faced repeated allegations of pushbacks. Previous expulsions at sea have been partly captured on video, but Greek authorities argue they are permitted to repulse undocumented migrants attempting to enter the country’s territory. Independent monitors have pieced together apparent pushbacks from Greek land, but this incident appears to be the first such video footage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/bereaved-families-withdraw-support-uk-covid-tapestry-pandemic","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:42:59Z","webTitle":"Bereaved families withdraw support for UK Covid tapestry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/bereaved-families-withdraw-support-uk-covid-tapestry-pandemic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/bereaved-families-withdraw-support-uk-covid-tapestry-pandemic","fields":{"headline":"Bereaved families withdraw support for UK Covid tapestry","bodyText":"Britain’s Covid experience is to be woven into an official tapestry, following a tradition running from the Norman conquest to the D-day landings. But some bereaved families have already withdrawn their participation. Stories from the pandemic will be captured in warp and weft by artists in a work commissioned by the chair of the UK-wide public inquiry into the pandemic, Heather Hallett. She announced the project on Monday “so that the experiences of those who suffered hardship and loss are at the heart of the inquiry’s proceedings”. The curator, Ekow Eshun, a former director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, will steer the project and the first 3.5 metres will be unveiled on 13 June when public hearings into the UK’s pandemic preparedness begin in London. The project is likely to be highly contested given the breadth of experiences of the coronavirus years, which resulted in 226,196 fatalities with Covid on death certificates. Some members of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice who had initially agreed to collaborate on the tapestry have pulled out in frustration because they want their voice heard in the formal inquiry proceedings rather than woven into cloth, the group said. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any restrictions on political content – for example, capturing lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street or failures to properly protect care homes from infection. Tapestry panels are understood to be in development on themes including bereavement, education, working on the frontline, isolation and mental health. One source said designs were likely to be “less about what actually happened and more about the emotional impact”. No final length has been set for the tapestry but it appears likely to extend to more than 10 metres. Andrew Crummy, an artist who designed the 2013 Great Tapestry of Scotland that purported to capture 420m years of history, has been working with “bereaved families to help give voice to their stories”. He said political issues did not come up in his conversations with bereaved families for a 1 metre x 70cm panel he has sent for weaving. “They just wanted to talk about the person they lost,” he said. Barbara Herbert, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “Bereaved families will have mixed feelings about the tapestry. Commemoration is important, and it will mean a lot to those personally involved, but equally it can in no way be a substitute for listening to our experiences and learning from them. “We didn’t throw all we could into campaigning for the inquiry for nice gestures, we did it to save lives and stop others from going through the same horrors that we have.” The group has previously criticised Lady Hallett’s approach to involving members in the main proceedings of the inquiry. Some are boycotting a “listening exercise” that is meant to distill the public’s experience. The group has also criticised the “deeply upsetting” decision not to call more bereaved families as formal witnesses. Eshun, who also oversees the choice of sculptures for Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth, said: “Throughout history, tapestries have been used to mark the moments that change us, telling our stories and commemorating the impact on millions of people’s lives. “The pandemic put an unimaginable strain on the fabric of our society, our communities and our families. My hope is that this tapestry will weave the threads of these stories, across the nations and regions, into a lasting tribute.” People involved include Sammie McFarland, from the charity Long Covid Kids, who said: “We hope the tapestry will weave our experiences together into a visible representation that documents the appalling harm to children.” Delia Bryce, from the Scottish Covid Bereaved group, whose father died from Covid in February 2021, said: “I hope those that see it in years to come will understand why it’s important our loved ones lost to Covid-19 should never be forgotten.” The tapestry will be shown in various locations throughout the UK. “We plan to add more panels over time, so this tapestry reflects the scale and impact the pandemic had on different communities,” a statement from the inquiry said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/cheetah-deaths-questions-india-reintroduction-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:23:31Z","webTitle":"Cheetah deaths raise questions over India’s reintroduction scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/cheetah-deaths-questions-india-reintroduction-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/cheetah-deaths-questions-india-reintroduction-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Cheetah deaths raise questions over India’s reintroduction scheme","bodyText":"A programme to reintroduce cheetahs in India after 75 years has been called into question after three of the animals died in recent weeks and concerns were raised that their new habitat was unsuitable. Since October, 20 cheetahs – which became extinct in the country in 1952 – have been brought over from South Africa and Namibia as part of a much-lauded government programme to house them in Kuno national park, Madhya Pradesh state. The first eight cheetahs arrived amid much fanfare, with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, releasing them into a small fenced enclosure on his 72nd birthday. Another 12 African cheetahs have since been flown over and the plan is to release a total of 50 over the next five to 10 years. However, the programme was criticised by many wildlife and conservation experts, who accused the Modi government of a rushed “publicity stunt” and alleged that Kuno national park was an unsuitable habitat for so many cheetahs, which usually require vast habitats of thousands of square miles to roam. In Kuno their terrain will be less than 500 square miles. The concerns have been heightened in recent weeks after the deaths of three of the cheetahs still being held in captivity in the fenced enclosure inside Kuno, months after arriving in India. Sasha, a male, died from a pre-existing medical condition in March, another died in April and a female, Daksha, died this month in a violent mating after she was put in an enclosure with two other males. In a supreme court hearing last week, the judges claimed Kuno national park was an unfit home for dozens of African cheetahs. “It appears that Kuno is not sufficient for so many cheetahs. There is too much concentration of cheetahs in one place,” said the bench of judges. They called on the government to “rise above politics” and consider homing some of the cheetahs in other states such as Rajasthan, where the opposition party rules at the state level. “They need to be protected, they need to be given suitable habitat. Why don’t you explore for more suitable habitat than Kuno?” said the bench. Scientists in India leading the reintroduction efforts have said deaths are to be expected and are not symptomatic of a failure of the project. They said four cheetah cubs had also been born since they were brought to India. But for wildlife experts critical of the reintroduction experiment, the supreme court’s acknowledgment that Kuno is not suitable has come too late. There is also concern that India lacks the expertise to properly handle the cheetahs, especially as they remained in captivity for so long. So far only three of the big cats have been released into the park and 17 remain in human captivity in the enclosure. Ravi Chellam, coordinator of Biodiversity Collaborative, called the programme “a vanity project” and said it was at best creating “a glorified safari park” that had little to do with conservation and could have a negative effect on the health of the animals and on wider conservation efforts in India. “The deaths have brought attention to much more fundamental problems,” he said. “Why are the cheetahs being held in captivity for so long? The people who wrote the action plan are now saying that Kuno is inadequate. Why have they brought over 20 cheetahs from Africa if only eight to 10 can be accommodated in the park? What are we trying to achieve here?” In response to the supreme court, the government representative said a taskforce was investigating the deaths and that other locations were being investigated to home some of the cheetahs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/daniel-penny-interview-jordan-neely","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:10:10Z","webTitle":"Man charged over Jordan Neely killing says ‘I’m not a white supremacist’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/daniel-penny-interview-jordan-neely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/daniel-penny-interview-jordan-neely","fields":{"headline":"Man charged over Jordan Neely killing says ‘I’m not a white supremacist’","bodyText":"The retired US marine who has been charged with manslaughter after he placed a fellow New York City subway rider in a deadly chokehold has denied that he was acting as a vigilante, insisting “I’m not a white supremacist … I’m a normal guy.” Daniel Penny, who is white, defended his conduct in an interview with the New York Post. He expressed sadness but showed no personal remorse about the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old Black man who had been struggling with mental illness and lack of housing. “I’m deeply saddened by the loss of life,” Penny, 24, said. “It’s tragic what happened to him. Hopefully we can change the system that’s so desperately failed us.” Neely died on 1 May in a confrontation that was recorded by an onlooker on video. Eyewitnesses reported that he had been shouting on the F train and begging for money but had not been violent towards other passengers when he was dragged to the ground and gripped around his neck by Penny for several minutes. The killing sparked a debate about racism, homelessness and vigilantism in New York. At Neely’s funeral at a church in Harlem on Friday, the civil rights activist and pastor Al Sharpton, delivering the eulogy, called Penny’s actions a crime that exposed the brutal treatment of individuals in need. “People keep criminalizing people that need help,” Sharpton said. “They don’t need abuse – they need help.” The medical examiner has ruled Neely’s death a homicide caused by “compression of neck (chokehold)”. Neely’s family has called for his death to be prosecuted as murder. The New York Post asked Penny whether he would act the same way if he found himself in a similar situation. He replied: “You know, I live an authentic and genuine life. And I would – if there was a threat and danger in the present.” The Post went on to ask him whether he felt shame for any aspect of his conduct. “I don’t, I mean, I always do what I think is right,” he said. When the Post read excerpts of Sharpton’s eulogy to Penny and asked him to respond, he said he was “not sure” who Sharpton was. He said: “I don’t really know celebrities that well.” Penny added he was remaining calm despite the media blitz that has engulfed him. “What’s the point of worrying about something?” he said. “Worrying is not going to make your problems disappear.” Penny, who has been released from custody on $100,000 bail, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted as charged of second-degree manslaughter. In the wake of his arrest and prosecution, rightwing outlets and senior Republican politicians have rallied to his side. A “legal defense fund” on the Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo has so far raised $2.7m for Penny. In the interview, his first since killing Neely, Penny described his actions on the day though he would not go into details about what precisely happened inside the train carriage. He said he had been at school where he is studying architecture and was returning to Manhattan to go to the gym and then back to his home at the time in the East Village. All he would say about encountering Neely was that it was unlike anything he had experienced in the past. “This was different,” he said. “This time was much different.” Penny told the Post that he was widely travelled, both as a marine and as a civilian, arguing that his experiences belied any suggestion he was racist. “I mean, it’s a little bit comical,” he told the newspaper. “Everybody who’s ever met me can tell you, I love all people, I love all cultures. You can tell by my past and all my travels and adventures around the world. I was actually planning a road trip through Africa before this happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2023/may/22/buttery-onion-rice-and-jazzed-up-beans-on-toast-what-to-eat-when-youre-in-the-comfort-zone","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T13:00:35Z","webTitle":"Buttery onion rice and jazzed-up beans on toast – what to eat when you’re in the comfort zone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/22/buttery-onion-rice-and-jazzed-up-beans-on-toast-what-to-eat-when-youre-in-the-comfort-zone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2023/may/22/buttery-onion-rice-and-jazzed-up-beans-on-toast-what-to-eat-when-youre-in-the-comfort-zone","fields":{"headline":"Buttery onion rice and jazzed-up beans on toast – what to eat when you’re in the comfort zone","bodyText":"Melek Erdal’s jazzed-up beans on toast (pictured above) Whenever I have friends round, it doesn’t matter what time, we make breakfasty food.

Serve all together and top with some fresh coriander and maybe a wedge of lemon or lime. Melek Erdal is a food writer and a regular guest on Radio 4’s The Kitchen Cabinet Georgina Hayden’s strapatsada Growing up, this kind of dish would always be on the side in both of my grandmothers’ kitchens, and it’s what my mum would make on a Saturday afternoon, or for a lazy weeknight when there wasn’t much in the house. She would make it with tinned tomatoes, because they’re versatile and cheap, and she and my sister love it. I never really did until I got older and made it with fresh tomatoes, which I have on my counter even in the depths of winter. I grate and cook them down till they’re sweet, adding a few flavours – garlic, paprika, a bit of chilli, depending on who I’m cooking it for – before rippling in eggs right at the end. It doesn’t sound like much but it’s amazing. It’s also really versatile. This is a recipe for four, but it scales up or down really well – divide the tomatoes and eggs and play loose with the rest as you like. Got no onion, or too much onion? Fine. Add a tablespoon of tomato puree for richness; crumble over feta instead of halloumi. I make it quickly for my daughters after school, but also will do it as part of a lazy brunch spread if friends or family come round at the weekend. You can eat it hot or at room temperature. Strapatsada is the Greek word – my Cypriot family would call this ntomata me avga, which really just means tomatoes with egg. It’s a really simple way to cook any vegetable you have – instead of the tomato, try asparagus in the spring, or courgette in the summer. Serves 4 ripe tomatoes 800g olive oil 2 tbsp butter a large knob onion 1, peeled and finely chopped garlic 2 cloves, peeled and finely chopped sweet smoked paprika a big pinch caster sugar 1 tsp red wine vinegar ½ tbsp dried oregano 1 tsp sea salt and freshly ground black pepper free-range eggs 8 large halloumi 75g toast or pitta bread to serve Grate the tomatoes on a coarse grater, discarding the skins. Heat the oil and butter in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat and add the onion and garlic. Fry for 10 minutes, until it starts to soften and become sticky. Stir in the paprika, sugar, vinegar and most of the dried oregano (reserve a large pinch). Fry for another minute, then add the chopped or grated tomatoes, and season well with salt and pepper. Gently bring to the boil, reduce the heat just a little, then leave to cook for about 15 minutes. Most of the liquid needs to have evaporated and the tomatoes should start to gently caramelise. Crack the eggs into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Beat and then pour into the pan with the tomatoes. Lower the heat a little more and scramble the eggs and tomatoes together. Keep stirring and cooking over a low heat. When the eggs are half cooked, remove from the heat. Keep stirring off the heat until the eggs are creamy and silky. Sprinkle with the remaining oregano and coarsely grate over the halloumi. Serve with toast or pitta. Georgina Hayden is a food writer and broadcaster. Her latest book is Nistisima (Bloomsbury, £26) Georgia Levy’s lemon, parmesan and rocket pasta This is a dish for one of those days where you’ve been very busy, or very stressed, or you just need the comfort of pasta, but you don’t want to spend ages standing over your sauce, stirring, buying mince, waiting for your tomatoes to cook down. You need pasta and you need it now. You want the rocket in there for the crunch and to have a vegetable element, a touch of green. You can play pretty loose with the amounts – I sometimes add an extra handful of parmesan if it’s been a really bad day. And you can adapt it to whatever you have around – chopped asparagus can go in with the garlic, or broccoli, perhaps grated courgette. Really, anything you have in your fridge can be thrown in there. I often have ricotta in mine, so a couple of tablespoons stirred in at the end adds creaminess, but not in a sickly way. There’s a kind of magic that happens when you combine oil, lemon juice and pasta water – it wraps round the pasta to bring all the elements together. It’s something you can do with ingredients through the seasons, so you don’t have that separation between pasta and sauce. The secret is to let everything meet over a low heat – bizarre things happen to parmesan if it gets too hot. When writing recipes, I always find it hard to specify how much pasta to cook, because if it’s for me, I probably double it. I can definitely smash three-quarters of a bag. Pasta is always there for you. Serves 1 fusilli 100-125g or any other pasta olive oil 2 tbsp garlic 1 small clove, finely sliced dried chilli flakes a pinch, plus extra to serve lemon juice a squeeze parmesan or pecorino 25g, finely grated rocket 1 x 60g bag, roughly chopped Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and cook your pasta to just shy of al dente. Meanwhile, warm the oil in a wide frying pan (that can hold the pasta) over a medium-low heat and gently fry the garlic until it begins to feel sticky and is slightly golden on the edges. Add the chilli flakes, wait a second for them to warm through, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Add 1-2 tablespoons of pasta cooking water and half the cheese – you want it finely grated so it just melts away. Making sure the heat isn’t too high, stir until the cheese has just melted and you have a sauce. Take off the heat if the pasta isn’t ready yet. As soon as the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a cup of the cooking liquid. Turn the heat up to medium and add the pasta to the sauce, stirring constantly for 2-3 minutes until every piece is coated. It should be nice and wet, add more cooking water if not. Take off the heat and fold in the remaining cheese and rocket. Don’t be shocked by the amount of rocket, it cooks down dramatically and adds a great peppery flavour. Season with pepper (and salt if it needs it) and carefully fold until the cheese has melted. I like it when the rocket still has a bit of crunch. Transfer to plates, sprinkle with a little extra chilli and serve. Georgia Levy is a food writer and recipe developer. Her latest book is Let’s Do Lunch (Pavillion, £16.99) Itamar Srulovich’s onion rice My go-to simple comfort meal is Nigella’s Marmite pasta. But my wife doesn’t love it so much. So, when we’re together, we make onion rice, and its derivative, tuna rice. It’s so simple, but the most delicious thing. My stepfather used to make it every Friday. Friday night is a big deal in Israel. In old-school families, you’re not allowed to cook on Saturdays, so on Friday, until about 2pm everybody cooks the food for the weekend. Even though my family was not religious, we still cooked for a Friday night dinner. Onion rice was non-negotiable – it would be the first thing we ate for a late lunch on Friday. Onion rice is not a side, it’s a dish on its own, and it’s a ceremony – a very pure moment. It is basically onions cooked in butter, or margarine is even better. You have to use chicken stock cubes of the cheapest variety – the bright yellow ones. It’s the only recipe where I’d use no other spice than black pepper. This is the starting point. Sometimes we’ll riff on it, and fold in tuna at the end. This version is called dirty onion rice. That’s the trinity. You can add other things, but there are rules. You can add carrot and celery to the onion but they must be chopped the same size. On rare occasions tinned tomatoes can go in, but you need to change the water ratio, which is why we don’t often do it. Tomato puree is sometimes a welcome addition. Spinach or a parmesan rind, or fresh cheese with the tuna. Sometimes you don’t know what is right, but you will know if it’s wrong. The thought of adding spice makes me recoil in my heart. There is something very comforting about having food rules. Serves 2 chicken stock cubes 2 (homemade stock will produce inferior results) butter or vegetable oil 1 tbsp onions 2 large, chopped but not too fine long grain rice 210g (1 x 250ml cup) Boil a kettle, measure 375ml of water and dissolve the stock cubes. In a large, shallow pan, heat the fat and onion on a low heat and saute until soft and translucent – do not let it colour. Add the rice to the pan and saute until all the grains are nice and glossy. Add your stock and a good shake of black pepper. Taste – different brands of stock have different levels of salt; the liquid should be powerfully salty but not unpleasantly so. If it isn’t, add a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil. Once boiling, stir the rice, lower the heat to a gentle simmer and cover the pan with a tight fitting lid for exactly 10 minutes – put a timer on. When the timer beeps, take off the heat but do not remove the lid – set another 10 minutes on the timer and leave to steam with the lid on. After 10 minutes, remove the lid – the rice should be fully cooked and fragrant, the onion soft, translucent and jelly-like, forming a ring around the edge of the pot. Gently stir it in with the rice and serve. Onion rice is a moment of simple pleasure. Enjoy it as such. Itamar Srulovich is a chef and co-founder of Honey &amp; Co Tarunima Sinha’s crumpet and uttapam love butter We always have crumpets at home. My husband loves them, but I find them lacking in flavour. Over the years, I started adding chilli to them, and then one day I thought I’d try dipping one in yoghurt, which we also always have, and steaming it. It was a bit like an uttapam, a south Indian pancake traditionally made with fermented rice and lentil batter. It has a crispy base and a soft spongy texture on top, and gets loaded with onions, tomatoes and chillies. Making uttapam properly is a time-consuming process, and you need proper knowledge otherwise it’s a disaster. Even though I love the rhythm of that elaborate process, this recipe satisfies an immediate craving, a happy experiment using staples in my kitchen. Nigella seeds are essential, and I always have curry leaves as I grow them. You can use coconut milk or yoghurt if you don’t eat dairy. And if you have leftover mashed potato, you can add some spices and use it to top the uttapam-crumpet for dosa vibes. You know when you buy an ingredient for one dish and then it just sits around? I had some shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice blend with sesame seeds and chilli, in the cupboard and so I started using it on lots of things, including this. Weirdly, it tastes a bit south Indian to me. Just like crumpets, uttapam loves butter – and so do I, so it’s nice to make a spiced butter to finish it. I probably eat this every 10 days, when I crave something with Indian flavours but don’t like to faff around. Serves 1 greek yoghurt 200g salt ¼ tsp lemon juice 1 tbsp crumpets 2 red onion ½ large, finely chopped tomato ½ large, finely chopped (deseed if you prefer) carrot ½, coarsely grated thin Indian green chillies 1-2, finely chopped (optional) curry leaves 2-3 fresh sprigs, or fresh coriander leaves (although the flavours are different) butter 1 tbsp nigella seeds 1 tbsp shichimi togarashi 1-2 tbsp (optional) For the spice butter unsalted butter 25g curry leaves 2-3 fresh sprigs, or fresh coriander leaves dried red whole chillies 2-3 The spiced butter is optional, but I recommend it as it adds a bit more flavour to the finished dish. In a small pan, add the butter, curry leaves and whole red chillies. Place on very low heat, and once the butter is melted, about 5 minutes, switch off the heat. Keep aside and let it infuse, and in the meantime prepare the crumpets. Put the yoghurt in a medium-sized bowl and give it a very quick whisk with a fork or a small whisk. Add the salt and lemon juice, mix and keep aside. Put the onion, tomato, carrot, green chillies and curry or coriander leaves in a bowl, mix together then keep aside . Place a heavy non-stick or cast-iron frying pan on low heat. Add the 1 tablespoon of butter, let it melt and coat the base of the pan. Brush both sides of the crumpet with the melted butter and place the darker plain side of the crumpets in the buttered pan. Don’t overcrowd the pan and keep the heat very low. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the prepared yoghurt on top of each crumpet, spreading a thick layer on the surface. Pile 2 tablespoons of the onion mix on each crumpet, gently pressing a little, and sprinkle generously with nigella seeds. Cover with a lid and let it cook for 5 minutes on medium-low heat. After 5 minutes, remove the lid and let it cook for a further 5 minutes on low heat till the base is crisp. Slide it out carefully on to a plate and drizzle a spoonful of the spiced butter on the onions. Sprinkle over some shichimi togarashi if using, and eat warm.

So it’s ironic that her casting as the titular Ariel was ever thought controversial. Bailey is both the finished film’s only unmitigated triumph and the best argument for this whole live action remake enterprise in one shimmering mermaidcore package. If these films are to have any purpose beyond being nostalgia-powered cash-ins, it must be to allow all children – not just the white ones – to see themselves as Magic Kingdom denizens. But almost everything else about this flops about like a dying fish on deck. Most significantly this applies to the trio of comic-relief characters: Sebastian the crab, Flounder the fish and Scuttle the seabird. This is no fault of the talented voice cast: Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay and Awkwafina, respectively. It’s just that things that are cute or funny when done by an anthropomorphised cartoon cuddlies are no longer cute or funny when done by computer-generated sea-life approximates with no recognisable facial expressions. Whole sequences of character interaction fondly remembered from its 1989 predecessor – Scuttle’s instructions on how to use a human “dinglehopper”, Flounder fleeing a shark attack – are rendered lifeless by CGI. And you’d be lucky to make much of it out through the murk of the underwater cinematography anyway. It hurts because The Little Mermaid, the original, is a true classic. Its song-and-dance numbers are among the best in the Disney canon, melding diverse influences from Harry Belafonte calypso to Esther William’s 1940s aquamusicals, with the wiggle of legendary drag queen Divine. These have been revived, with original composer Alan Menken drafted in alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda to produce new toe-tappers like The Scuttlebutt. Once again though, performances are fatally undermined by performers: the northern gannet is justly renowned for its diving abilities, but this seabird species simply cannot musically emote. Maybe it’s the beak. The Little Mermaid doesn’t lack for talent or audience goodwill – director Rob Marshall did wonders with Mary Poppins Returns – but the siren call of supposedly surefire box office has sunk it nonetheless. There is dry land in sight though, and it’s the same outcrop on which the House of Mouse was built: the realisation that some stories – the most magical ones, in fact – are best told with animation. • The Little Mermaid is released on 25 May in Australia, and on 26 May in the US and UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/22/greek-election-results-vital-progressive-parties-collaborate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:54:25Z","webTitle":"Centre-left politics has been dealt a crushing blow in Greece.

What can we learn from it?","bodyText":"Greece’s election results were a big surprise for the winners, the losers and the pollsters. In a country where huge numbers of people are struggling every day, with almost a third of the population estimated to be at risk of poverty, the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s rightwing New Democracy party managed to secure 40% of the vote – a remarkable victory that no polling agency predicted. The runner-up was the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras of the centre-left Syriza party, best known for its turbulent confrontation with the EU’s economic centres of power in 2015. He picked up only 20% of the vote, much lower than the pollsters had predicted and lower than most Greeks – friends and enemies of Syriza alike – thought possible. The lack of an outright majority for New Democracy makes the most plausible scenario a second election in June or early July – this round is designed to give bonus seats to the winner, increasing its chances of securing a majority. New Democracy’s victory was not unexpected, but the eye-watering share of the vote the party received is a different matter. The conservative government often points to its record of growth and investment, backed by European Commission forecasts, but the proceeds of this have not been felt evenly: a growing number of Greece’s population over the same period have dealt with low wages, low pensions, high rents and a painful cost of living crisis. The disparity between what is on paper and the bleak reality on the ground is striking. So why are the conservatives still out in front, with an outright majority within their grasp? It seems the promises of stability, growth and impenetrable borders have paid off. But there is also the question of the sorry state of the opposition. For Syriza, the high of the 2015 electoral triumph at the peak of the eurozone’s financial crisis was quickly tempered by the imposition of loans from Greece’s creditors that demanded huge sacrifices by the Greek people in order to control the country’s spiralling debt. The return of New Democracy to power in 2019 made clear the extent of disillusionment and hopelessness that Syriza’s base felt after voting against a bailout in a referendum – and then watching their government accept one. Since then the party leadership’s strategy has been to return to the centre ground to attract more moderate voters – and it has failed spectacularly. On top of that, the absence of any sign of contrition or self-reflection for the years Syriza was in government further alienated its electoral base. Whatever form the next government takes, the structural problems that Greece faces remain profound. Corruption is rife. A series of scandals – such as a phone-tapping scandal that has been dubbed the Greek Watergate – have stained the Mitsotakis premiership and speak loudly to the failure of the country’s institutions. New Democracy – and the social democratic Pasok party, with which it alternated in government from 1974 to 2015 – cannot escape responsibility for this long-term deterioration. Take the outrage over the Tempe railway tragedy in February, when the collision of two trains left 57 dead. The disaster led to protests and was raised by opposition parties during the election as a sign of the country’s administrative dysfunction: many believe it could have been avoided had the rail network not been so neglected. Greece does not fare much better on the international front. Only last week, footage was revealed that appeared to show 12 asylum seekers who had arrived at Lesbos being forcibly transferred to a Greek coastguard vessel and then abandoned in an inflatable boat in the middle of the sea. The rightwing government has dismissed allegations of being involved in the pushback of asylum seekers, but the video evidence and testimonies leave little doubt as to Greece’s infringements of European rules and international law. Nonetheless, it is partly this draconian treatment of migrants that has helped New Democracy shore up electoral support. Another story of the night is the slow recovery of Pasok. Once a force for change in the post-junta period, it picked up a respectable 11%, confirming an upwards trajectory after its near-fatal low of less than 5% in 2015. One factor behind this is that its leader, Nikos Androulakis, is an MEP and, as such, is not directly involved in Greek parliamentary shenanigans. In fact, Androulakis is even a victim of the Greek state itself – last year it was revealed that his phone had been tapped by Greece’s intelligence services. (Mitsotakis denied knowing about this and said it was wrong.) Maybe these results will be a wake-up call for Greece’s progressive parties as to the importance of collaborating with each other. To get anywhere close to winning office, however, they will have to learn to offer something more than just being a way of avoiding the worst-case scenario.

Yet this latest feat was overshadowed by reports that the manager, Luciano Spalletti, might not return next season. On Friday the club’s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, left room for doubt when he told Sky Sport: “Spalletti is a superstar and superstars need a place where they can express the best of themselves. He found that here and it all worked. [But] in life freedom is an immeasurable and invaluable good, you should never clip anyone’s wings just as I would not want anyone to clip mine.” Spalletti gave a bemused response at his pre-game press conference, saying: “I honestly have no idea what this clipping wings phrase is supposed to mean. It’s not pertinent to what we said to each other at [a post-Scudetto] dinner. I don’t need a pair of wings for what I’m trying to achieve, a pair of boots will do fine.” The manager’s contract at Napoli is set to expire at the end of this season, but the club holds options to extend by up to a further two years. De Laurentiis intended to trigger the first of these, but Spalletti is understood to want a new deal that reflects his achievement. His reported €3m per year salary is less than half what Massimiliano Allegri and José Mourinho make at Juventus and Roma respectively. De Laurentiis’s comments suggest a better offer might not be forthcoming. Claims that the pair don’t see eye to eye have persisted since last spring, when results were wobbling and a group of Ultras hung a sign outside the stadium telling Spalletti they would return his stolen Fiat Panda if he quit. Spalletti has a new Panda these days, decorated by Raffo Art to mark the Scudetto with a mural of Vesuvius and the manager’s favourite phrase, “uomini forti destini forti” – “strong men strong destiny”. Whether he will be riding it around town this summer or bombing up the A1 back towards his hometown Certaldo for a sabbatical remains to be seen. In the meantime, the Italian media have already begun to speculate about a possible replacement. Brighton’s Roberto De Zerbi was top of several newspapers’ lists over the weekend, but another popular name was Vincenzo Italiano. The Fiorentina manager just steered his team to the Europa Conference League final and will contest the Coppa Italia final against Inter on Wednesday. They have won nothing yet, but to come this far is a thrill for a club that last won a trophy in 2001. Fiorentina only narrowly avoided being dragged into a relegation fight in their last season before Italiano took charge in the summer of 2021. He immediately added 22 points and they qualified for Europe despite having his top scorer, Dusan Vlahovic, sold to Juventus in the middle of the campaign. It was the latest step in a dizzying ascent for Italiano, who was coaching amateur players in Serie D as recently as 2018. After guiding Arzignano Valchiampo to third place in their regional division, he moved to Trapani in Serie C where promotion was secured at the first attempt. The next season he was at Spezia in Serie B, repeating the trick as he took them immediately up to the top flight, before keeping them there in 2020-21. If you were to focus only on domestic league performance, you could call this the first season of Italiano’s coaching career in which results have gone backwards. Fiorentina will not match last season’s seventh-place finish, but who could expect them to? The Europa Conference League final against West Ham next month will be their 60th match in this campaign. Not even Inter or Roma, finalists in the other two continental competitions, can equal that number. How have they come this far? Not by conserving their energies, that’s for sure. Italiano’s tactics require constant intensity, pressing opponents high all over the pitch and every time possession is lost. In that way he is similar to De Zerbi, preferring his players to take risks even if that means leaving spaces behind. It helps that he believes in making full use of his squad, telling the newspaper La Repubblica last February that “you need every player to feel connected to the values and the investments of the club. I let all my players know, even the reserves, that I will not abandon them, that they are always in my head, I need all of them.” He has used 32 players this season and 22 have logged more than 1,000 minutes. No individual could pick up the slack left by Vlahovic’s departure, but Fiorentina have spread the load between 17 different scorers. They are far and away the most prolific side in the Europa Conference League, with 36 goals to West Ham’s 27. Things have not come so easy in Serie A, but they still carve out more shooting opportunities per game than anyone besides Napoli and Inter. If the two centre-forwards signed to replace Vlahovic, Luka Jovic and Arthur Cabral, were more consistent in their finishing, their league standing could be a lot higher. Italiano, though, has openly prioritised the European adventure, saying last week that if you had offered him a cup final in Rome or Prague at the start of this season, he would have chosen the latter. To reach both is something that few fans would even have dared to wish for. If it means less focus on Serie A for one season, so be it. Fiorentina, exhausted from an extra-time win over Basel in their Europa Conference League semi-final on Thursday, could only draw 1-1 at Torino on Sunday. Jovic found a goal that had eluded him in Switzerland, but Antonio Sanabria responded with a smoothly-taken equaliser, steering Alessandro Buongiorno’s centre across his body and into the bottom corner. The draw leaves Fiorentina joint-ninth in the table, and qualification for Europe next season now rests on winning one or other cup final. There is belief that either is possible. Fiorentina made a slow start to this season but have played better in 2023 despite their fatigue, the return of Nico González from injury helping to fire a nine-game winning run from February into April. Fiorentina will not be distracted by questions of what might come next. Italiano has been linked with other teams besides Napoli, but insisted after the Torino game that his mind was only in one place. “I do this job with love and passion, and the results are coming, which is the most important thing,” he said. “We have two finals to play now. We’ll think about the future after that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/ex-mubarak-minister-mohamed-mansour-donates-5m-to-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:34:14Z","webTitle":"Ex-Mubarak minister Mohamed Mansour donates £5m to Tories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/ex-mubarak-minister-mohamed-mansour-donates-5m-to-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/ex-mubarak-minister-mohamed-mansour-donates-5m-to-tories","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Mubarak minister Mohamed Mansour donates £5m to Tories","bodyText":"The Conservatives have accepted a £5m donation from an Egyptian-born billionaire who served as a minister in the government of the former president Hosni Mubarak. Mohamed Mansour, who was made senior treasurer of the Conservatives in December, announced he had given the sum to the party, its biggest one-off donation for more than 20 years. Writing in the Telegraph, Mansour, who served as a transport minister under Mubarak from 2006 to 2009, said he had given the money to assist Rishi Sunak, whom he described as “a very capable prime minister” who understood the economy. Mansour is the chair of the Mansour Group multinational corporation, which he owns with two of his brothers. Through another of his companies, Unatrac, he has previously donated about £600,000 to the Tories. The new donation is the biggest for the Conservatives since Paul Getty gave the same sum to the party in 2001. When Mansour was given his Conservative party treasurer role, Labour said Sunak could not claim to stand up for integrity when there was “a billionaire who was a part of Hosni Mubarak’s autocratic regime being put in charge of drumming up donations”. In his article, Mansour wrote: “I believe that this country has a very capable prime minister, one who understands how growth is generated in the modern economy. He gets the importance of technology and innovation. He can make the modern economy work for all UK citizens. “My confidence in the prime minister is why I was proud to become a senior treasurer of the Conservative party last December. I want to give him the best chance of having a full five-year term and so have donated £5m to the party’s election fighting fund.

The ex-Nirvana drummer started fronting Foo Fighters in the fallout of Kurt Cobain’s death; nearly 30 years later, they’re earnestly promoting themselves as “the last great American rock band”. A similar sense of answering immeasurable grief with tireless forward motion permeates the band’s latest return to the spotlight, a live stream to unveil their next phase. Just over a year ago, in March 2022, Taylor Hawkins, the band’s drummer of 25 years, died of a sudden cardiac arrest with drugs including opiates, antidepressants and benzodiazepines found in his body. He was 50 years old. Fans mourned a musician so skilled that he somehow made the kit his own while sharing stages with Gen X’s favourite drummer; his bandmates publicly celebrated his life by playing two stadium-sized tribute shows featuring guest appearances from everyone from Lars Ulrich to Kesha. But tonight’s live stream, titled Preparing Music for Concerts, is firmly focused on the present and future. The footage fades into view in black and white and begins with a scene of innocuous band banter: “Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone in your own band on stage?” Grohl randomly asks his four surviving cohorts. Their subsequent smiley reminiscences mark the first sign of normality in the Foos camp in more than a year. Hawkins isn’t mentioned once over the ensuing hour, which dwells instead on the question of his replacement for their forthcoming US tour, a potentially morbid question that they answer with trademark good humour. The Foos are known for this kind of lightheartedness, found in everything from the Learn to Fly video to their Carrie-parodying Ice Bucket Challenge. Today, a cavalcade of superstar drummers bust into the band’s Studio 606, only to excuse themselves. Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith? Someone’s Mercedes is blocking his car. Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee? He’s just bringing in some Chinese food. Tool’s Danny Carey? He’s only here to groom the Foos’ poodles. The punchline is that actual fill-in Josh Freese was in the same room, perched behind an offscreen drum kit, the entire time. For anyone who’s paid attention over the past year, him landing the job isn’t a stunning revelation. The chameleonic session musician – who already has Nine Inch Nails, Bruce Springsteen, Paramore, Weezer and Guns N’ Roses on his CV – played at both Hawkins memorial concerts in 2022. Last week, he left his posts in both the Offspring and Danny Elfman’s band. The writing was on the wall, no matter how star-studded the smokescreen. Similarly unsurprising is that Freese plays Foos songs as if Hawkins mentored him. Once the music starts, All My Life is just as volatile a post-hardcore explosion as it was on 2002’s One By One. The scrambling pace plays to Freese’s punk roots (as well as Grohl’s underrated throat-shredding howls) and he even gets a mid-song solo. By the time he has thrashed his way through Monkey Wrench, to the visible awe of his new bandmates, it’s clear the sheer extent to which this stream is all about him. He and Grohl frequently geek out on drumming between songs; the frontman also quizzes him on his punk band the Vandals and his days playing in a Disneyland covers act at 12 years old. The other throughline of tonight’s proceedings is that the Foos are releasing a new album next week (2 June) and it can’t promote itself. The stream’s monochrome colour scheme is doubtlessly designed to tether it to But Here We Are, with its black and white cover and music videos. Both singles, classic-sounding anthem Rescued and bittersweet yet uptempo rocker Under You, are performed, the latter especially evocative in its exploration of loss: “Think I’m getting over it / But there’s no getting over it.” They debut a new song, Nothing at All. The verses’ strummed guitar and swaggering bassline crescendo with a pop-hardcore hook. “Never mind, love and hate! / Peace of mind, it’s a bit too late!” Grohl snarls to end a lyrical breakdown of a tumultuous relationship. Together, these three songs paint a picture of a back-to-basics rock record, eschewing the prog of 2017’s Concrete and Gold and the dance flourishes of 2021’s Medicine at Midnight. It may prove an apt soundtrack to a band clearly craving a renewed sense of normality in the aftermath of tragedy. Ultimately, what Preparing Music for Concerts deals best in is reassurance: the Foos can still play powerfully and enjoy themselves with their first new drummer since 1997, while their forthcoming output seems set to resume the band’s hard-rocking ways. Dave Grohl’s lemonade stand is still doing brisk business. • But Here We Are is released via Roswell/RCA on 2 June • This article was updated on 22 May to more accurately report the drugs in Hawkins’ body when he died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/tim-scott-to-enter-2024-race-us-republican-presidential-nomination","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:16:47Z","webTitle":"Tim Scott to enter 2024 race for US Republican presidential nomination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/tim-scott-to-enter-2024-race-us-republican-presidential-nomination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/tim-scott-to-enter-2024-race-us-republican-presidential-nomination","fields":{"headline":"Tim Scott to enter 2024 race for US Republican presidential nomination","bodyText":"Tim Scott is set to enter the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination on Monday, wading into a battle that has so far been dominated by two conservative favorites: Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Scott, the only Black Republican US senator, is scheduled to make his official campaign announcement in his home town of North Charleston after filing papers for his candidacy last week with the Federal Election Commission. The late morning event is being hosted at Charleston Southern University, Scott’s alma mater and a private school affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. Then he will spend Tuesday with donors in Charleston before a two-day campaign swing to Iowa and New Hampshire as he tries to set himself apart from Trump – who won the presidency in 2016 before losing it in 2020 – and DeSantis, Florida’s governor who is widely expected to announce. Scott is touting a vision of the US with themes harkening back to Ronald Reagan’s presidency, calling for policy based on “personal responsibility”, abortion access restrictions and rigorous enforcement of border security. Others in the Republican field who have already declared include the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and Woke, Inc author Vivek Ramaswamy.

Yet if Tilson Thomas’s own dynamic energy now needs to be husbanded to some extent, this did not translate into any loss of momentum or intensity in the orchestra’s performance: small gestures – a lean towards the cellos here, a shimmy of the fingers to fade out the brass there – were enough to shape the music into the kind of long, elastic lines that make Brahms’s notes glow. Besides, he had an energy generator beside him for the Violin Concerto. This was one of a series of LSO concerts this year featuring the violinist Christian Tetzlaff, who is never one to wallow in music like this: from his very first entry he was pushing forwards as if there was no time to lose, and this sense of urgency underpinned the colossal first movement until the final minutes, when the violin’s beatific recall of the opening melody gave the feeling that something momentous had been wrangled with and resolved. Nor was there any sense of complacency in the second movement; among the long, soaring melodies came moments where Tetzlaff almost let the violin’s sound dissolve into nothing. The finale was a rollercoaster, Tetzlaff bringing a fiddler’s energy to the main tune. His Bach encore danced too, but elegantly, serving as a gentle wind-down. Tilson Thomas took a more conventionally spacious approach to the Serenade No 1, Brahms’s earliest orchestral work, but the six movements still flew by, the orchestra weaving thick textures but never letting the sound become too heavy. In a performance peppered with characterful wind and horn solos, the orchestra was on fine form, coming together in the finale to round off the evening with one last glowing crescendo. • Tetzlaff series continues on 4 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/this-morning-review-the-first-post-phillip-schofield-show-treats-him-as-if-hes-died","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:15:09Z","webTitle":"This Morning review – the first post-Phillip Schofield show treats him as if he’s died  ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/this-morning-review-the-first-post-phillip-schofield-show-treats-him-as-if-hes-died","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/this-morning-review-the-first-post-phillip-schofield-show-treats-him-as-if-hes-died","fields":{"headline":"This Morning review – the first post-Phillip Schofield show treats him as if he’s died  ","bodyText":"Watching This Morning last week was a surreal experience. We viewers became body language experts, assessing whether or not reports of a falling out between Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield were true. The show’s hosts continued to act as if everything was fine, even running a news review that ignored the fact their relationship was dominating half of the front pages. But with Schofield stepping down from This Morning “with immediate effect” on Saturday afternoon, the show that had acted as if it was broadcasting from a parallel universe was forced to address the subject it had been so rigorously avoiding. After Lorraine Kelly ended her preceding show by talking about a “big story” from the weekend – “Beyoncé has been splashing out at a Nando’s” – the first sign that anything was amiss came in the opening titles, newly shorn of Schofield and Willoughby. Then Dermot O’Leary and Alison Hammond appeared, with O’Leary delivering surely the flattest “Hello and welcome to Monday’s This Morning” in the show’s history. “Now, we can’t start today’s show without paying tribute to the man who spent the last two decades sitting on This Morning’s sofa, Phillip Schofield,” said Hammond, as a montage of Schofield photos appeared on screen, giving the impression that he had died. “So, as a show, everyone on and off screen at ITV and This Morning want to say a huge thank you to Phil for what he has done to make the show such a success over the last 21 years,” added O’Leary. “Quite simply, we all know he is one of the best live television broadcasters this country has ever had. And we and all the team wish him all the best for the future,” Hammond concluded. That was it: 30 seconds, with no explanation about why he had left, merely a followup mentioning that Willoughby would be returning in June. The reaction from viewers was probably the same as you would expect from Pam in Gavin &amp; Stacey (pointing at the screen, yelling: “IS THAT IT?”). In fact, many This Morning regulars may have missed the statement altogether, with the show starting slightly earlier than usual. Once the statement was out of the way, Hammond and O’Leary continued to act as if everything was fine. A review of the day’s news followed, ignoring the Sun’s front page, which led with “PHIL: I’M COMPLETELY BROKEN”, and the Daily Mail’s: “How emoji in Holly’s message secretly shows what she REALLY thinks about Phil”. After talking about Suella Braverman’s speeding fine, Hammond and O’Leary brought up the big news from the weekend … yep, that’s right, Beyoncé going to Nando’s. Later, there was a discussion about the menopause and an interview with Philip Glenister. At one point, the hosts mentioned a trip down memory lane, which for a second may have made viewers think about Schofield. It was a segment about Croatia. The problem This Morning faces is the same one it had when Willoughby and Schofield were in situ. No matter how much the hosts try to talk about something else, we haven’t moved on, so the rest of the show fades into the background. Coincidentally, last night’s pre-recorded episode of Family Fortunes, hosted by Gino d’Acampo, featured a round with the question: “Name somebody who regularly appears on the TV show This Morning.” The top answers were, of course, Willoughby and Schofield. That round of Family Fortunes lasted several minutes. Today, This Morning talked about Schofield for only 30 seconds. • This Morning is broadcast on ITV every weekday"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/22/eruptions-explosions-sexually-explicit-hoover-va-photography-centre-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:11:27Z","webTitle":"Eruptions, explosions and a sexually explicit hoover: V&A Photography Centre review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/eruptions-explosions-sexually-explicit-hoover-va-photography-centre-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/eruptions-explosions-sexually-explicit-hoover-va-photography-centre-review","fields":{"headline":"Eruptions, explosions and a sexually explicit hoover: V&A Photography Centre review","bodyText":"Paul Trevor’s Constant Exposure, a patchwork print of black-and-white television stills, looks just like life in the age of the smartphone, quite a feat when you consider that it was created back in the 1980s. A news anchor, a war plane dropping bombs and bare breasts are among the multitude of jumbled images. Standing in front of it in the V&amp;A’s new Photography Centre, I can’t help but laugh – here I am contemplating a work about the everyday onslaught of pictures in a new suite of galleries filled with them. But that’s the thing. While out in the real world images come at you hot and heavy, in here they offer a respite, access to another time and place. Spread across seven 19th-century galleries in the north-east wing are 600 works out of the museum’s 800,000-strong collection that stretch from the 1840s to the present. There’s a lot – a lot of images and a lot of labels – but take your time and you’ll be duly rewarded. The first couple of galleries opened in 2018 and have been rehung with a focus on energy in photography. That’s as vague as it sounds, but the outcome is less muddled than you might think. I find myself lingering in front of Adolphe Braun’s still life of jostling flowers mid-bloom, and William Henry Fox Talbot’s delicate depictions of leaves and ferns. My favourite: the ghostly sciagraphs of reptiles taken by James Green and James H Gardiner in 1897, soon after X-rays were discovered, presented in a glass vitrine as if they’re real specimens ribbiting with life. We go from froggy silhouettes to vast railways with soaring, whale-like roofs. Captured on camera are advances in cars, trains, planes. Disasters both natural (the eruption of Mount Vesuvius) and not (the atomic bomb). Moon landings. All hand in hand with advances in the medium: created without a camera, Man Ray’s Le Souffle (1931) is an experimental type of photograph achieved by placing a fan on light-sensitive paper. Unfolding chronologically, the display unravels the history of both photography and the world. Among the most poignant portraits are Bill Brandt’s sooty impressions of mining communities in northern England and Wales, and Dorothea Lange’s images of migrant families forced to abandon dried and damaged land in dust bowl America. See something that piques your interest? Delve deeper in a gallery dedicated to photographic books. Since they first appeared in 1843, four years after the invention of photography was made public, such tomes have provided an alternative, more intimate way of looking. More than 20,000 books from the Royal Photographic Society’s library are available to visitors on request, while others are at your disposal on open shelves. I spy everything from Susan Sontag’s seminal collection On Photography and monographs on Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin to Kodak data books and Photo Lab indices. My feeling is that it would have made sense to go straight from the opening galleries to the library, which takes so much of what we’ve seen so far and translates it to the page. Instead, we pass through a digital gallery housing a specially commissioned work that will change every six months. First up, The Zizi Show by Jake Elwes, an all-singing, all-dancing deepfake drag cabaret that draws attention to the bias in AI. With a colourful cast of kings, queens and more, the artist celebrates community and difference. That’s a thread that runs through the contemporary galleries, too. Recent acquisitions include a series of beautiful blue-tinged self-portraits by Tarrah Krajnak. Born in an orphanage in Peru in 1979 and adopted by Slovak Americans as a baby, in 2019 she projected media photos of the political upheaval that took place in her home country during the year of her birth on to her body. The result: a striking exploration of identity and a multi-layered historical narrative. A colourful echo of the makeshift homes set up by those families photographed by Lange in the US, Gauri Gill’s 2020 series The Village on the Highway depicts the temporary dwellings assembled by rural workers on major routes into Delhi. Protesting new laws that threatened their livelihoods, and banned from entering the capital, they remained in lodgings fashioned from farming equipment for over a year, when eventually their voices were heard. Wrapping around a corner are carefully considered images of tarpaulin-topped trailers, camp beds, stoves. A bumper sticker behind an empty deckchair reads: “Good Luck.” If you’re still not sure about how cameras work, you’ll find out in the final room, where you can experience the camera obscura. Step into a light room and your image will be projected upside down on to the wall of a dark room for others to see. A neat way to wrap up, and a reminder that the things we encounter every day on our smartphones aren’t exactly as they appear.

The move is being pushed by the Department for Transport in order to cut costs as it looks to “reform all aspects of the railway”. Most British train services now provide free wifi as standard but the DfT has told its contracted operators in England that they should cease offering it if they cannot justify it financially. The department said it was looking for “value for money” and wifi was low on passenger’s priorities, particularly on shorter journeys. The drive was questioned by passenger groups and industry figures who said the railway should be continuing to do all it could to attract people back, with peak commuter numbers still significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels. Christian Wolmar, who revealed the proposals on the Calling All Stations podcast, said it was a “ridiculous measure”, adding: “The DfT actually wants to reduce the quality of the train service by saying to passengers: sorry, you can’t access wifi. “It’s all about saving money. But we’re trying to attract commuters back on to the railway, and people like to get on their phone or laptops. “They’re going backwards. My view is that wifi is as essential as toilets now – people expect to be connected.” Bruce Williamson from the passenger campaign group Railfuture said: “One of the great things about travelling by train is that you can work or watch a video or listen to a podcast – and wifi is pretty essential for that. “We should be encouraging passengers to get back on the trains and this is a good example of a move that is going to make rail less attractive.” A DfT spokesperson said: “Our railways are currently not financially sustainable, and it is unfair to continue asking taxpayers to foot the bill, which is why reform of all aspects of the railways is essential. “Passenger surveys consistently show that on-train wifi is low on their list of priorities, so it is only right we work with operators to review whether the current service delivers the best possible value for money.” According to a Transport Focus report cited by the DfT, a survey in December 2022 showed wifi on trains was a lower priority for passengers than other features – although those included such essentials as value-for-money fares, reliability, punctuality and personal security. However, Transport Focus itself warned against the DfT’s conclusion. Anthony Smith, the chief executive, said: “Access to wifi is something many passengers now expect as standard. It helps people use their travel time productively and is something which could encourage more people to use rail over other modes. “Given the post-pandemic need to get more passengers back on the train, it would be difficult to justify removing something that makes rail more attractive to customers.” The DfT is also considering the cost of replacing or upgrading some on-train wifi equipment installed in the middle of the last decade, and whether passengers on shorter journeys use their own mobile phones or data rather than connecting to an operator’s wifi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-retire-from-professional-cycling-end-of-2023-season","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:05:58Z","webTitle":"Mark Cavendish to retire from pro cycling at the end of 2023 season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-retire-from-professional-cycling-end-of-2023-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-retire-from-professional-cycling-end-of-2023-season","fields":{"headline":"Mark Cavendish to retire from pro cycling at the end of 2023 season","bodyText":"Mark Cavendish has confirmed that he will call time on his glittering cycling career at the end of the season. The announcement came on the final rest day at the Giro D’Italia, with the 38-year-old telling reporters: “I’ve lived an absolute dream.” Throughout his career Cavendish was known as the “Manx Missile” because of the way he finished in high-speed sprints. His power and fearlessness has brought him 161 victories since 2005, as well as two green Tour de France points jerseys, a Rio 2016 Olympic silver omnium medal and the 2011 road world championship rainbow jersey. Cavendish refused to be drawn on where his final race would be. But surrounded by his wife Peta and family, he said: “This is a perfect opportunity to say with absolute joy in my heart that this will be my final season as a professional cyclist. When you understand it’s not forever, it’s easier to enjoy every feeling this sport has to offer.” Cavendish also confirmed he would be heading to the Tour de France with his team Astana Qazaqstan this summer. But while he shares the record of 34 stage victories in the race with Eddy Merckx, he insisted that beating the record was not the sole priority before he officially retires. “If I was on 45 wins on the Tour de France, I’d still be going to the Tour de France to win,” he said. “If I was on 18, I’d be looking for 19.” The Manxman, who celebrated his 38th birthday on Sunday, admitted it was the right time to call it a day. “Like many others I’ve been struggling with sickness during the race as well as the effects of some unfortunate crashes,” he said. “To get me through, I can’t thank this group of friends enough. “ Cycling has been my life for over 25 years and the bike has given me the opportunity to see the world and meet some incredible people. It’s taught me so much about life – dedication, loyalty, companionship, teamwork, sacrifice, humility and perseverance – all things that now, as a father, I can show my children. “Today is my son Casper’s fifth birthday, fortunately it’s a rest day and I can spend his birthday with him. I think it’s important now that I can be there for every birthday for my wife Peta and all our children. “It’s important I can see all their school concerts and support them in their sporting competitions and it’s important I can run around with them without fear of injury or getting sick.” British Cycling’s performance director, Stephen Park, paid tribute to Cavendish for what he called “a truly outstanding career”. Park said: “Cav is without doubt the sport’s greatest sprinter and will be remembered by fans across the world for his 53 Grand Tour stage wins, and I’m sure that we will all be cheering him on as he looks to add to that total in his final months of racing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-should-go-if-she-broke-ministerial-rules-says-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:02:04Z","webTitle":"‘Nothing untoward happened’ over speeding fine, says Braverman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-should-go-if-she-broke-ministerial-rules-says-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-should-go-if-she-broke-ministerial-rules-says-starmer","fields":{"headline":"‘Nothing untoward happened’ over speeding fine, says Braverman","bodyText":"Suella Braverman has insisted that “nothing untoward happened” over claims she broke the ministerial code in allegedly asking civil servants to assist over a speeding fine. Her comments came after No 10 confirmed Rishi Sunak has spoken to his ethics adviser over the issue, although no formal inquiry has yet begun. Speaking on a visit to a charity on Monday morning, Braverman confirmed that she had accepted a fine and points on her licence for speeding last summer but denied any wrongdoing over the ministerial code. “What I will say is that in my view I am confident that nothing untoward happened,” she said after being repeatedly pressed on the issue in a brief TV interview. She was later seen arriving at Downing Street. A spokesperson for Sunak said the prime minister, who returned from the G7 summit in Japan overnight, had been been “availing himself of the information” over reports Braverman broke rules by asking Home Office civil servants for special treatment after she was caught speeding. Sunak had spoken to Sir Laurie Magnus, his adviser on ministerial interests, the spokesperson said. However, it is understood the PM has not yet ordered Magnus to begin a formal investigation, something the adviser cannot do on his own. “The prime minister is availing himself of all the information,” the No 10 spokesperson said. “I obviously wouldn’t get into specific conversations. The prime minister, as you would expect, is in regular conversation with the home secretary. If anything changes or I can provide an update, I will.” In a development first reported by the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday, it was alleged that Braverman sought help from Home Office civil servants to try to avoid attending an in-person speed-awareness course after being caught speeding, or doing an online course where her name and face would be visible to other participants. Braverman was sacked during her first stint as home secretary, under Liz Truss, because she sent an official document from her personal email to a fellow MP, a breach of ministerial rules. Speaking earlier, Keir Starmer said Sunak must immediately begin a formal investigation into whether Braverman broke the ministerial code, and that she should leave her job if it finds that she did. “The prime minister needs to launch an investigation into this. I think he’s said he’s going to see his ethics adviser today, to have a meeting with him. What he needs to do – what I would do – is to say to that adviser: you need to investigate this,” the Labour leader told BBC1’s Breakfast programme. “From what we know, it looks as if inappropriate action took place from the home secretary that needs to be fully investigated. And I think that’s what many people are expecting from the prime minister this morning. “The ministerial code is pretty clear that if you break it, you’re supposed to go. But I don’t want to get ahead of myself. I don’t know all the facts. I don’t think anybody knows all of the facts. It looks as if some of the facts are still emerging. So the right thing to do is a proper investigation.” Pressed on whether Braverman should leave her job if she was found to have breached the ministerial code, Starmer said this was the case. “The prime minister did stand outside Downing Street when he became prime minister and say that he was going to bring about change, much-needed change, under this government and have accountability, honesty and transparency,” he said. “An investigation obviously comes first and then it’ll be up to the prime minister to take appropriate action, but the usual consequence of breaching the code is, of course, that you go.” Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, rejected the idea that Braverman was being targeted by officials. “This is about ministerial misconduct. It’s not about anyone coming for anyone,” he told Sky News. If Braverman had sought officials’ help over the speeding fine, Penman said, it would appear to have breached the code. “The ministerial code is clear that you have to separate out your private interests as a minister from your public duties, including the perception of any conflict in that,” he said. “A speeding fine is an entirely personal matter, so if she’s asked civil servants to intervene in any way on that, that would be a breach of the ministerial code.” A finding that she had broken the rules would not necessarily mean she had to step down, he added: “The ministerial code allows for a rap across the knuckles, or potentially resignation. It depends what she is found to have done.” Separately, the Mirror reported on Monday that Braverman’s special adviser, a political appointee rather than a civil servant, told the paper six weeks ago that it was “nonsense” the home secretary had been caught speeding. The adviser denied this four times, calling the claims “scurrilous” rumours, according to what the paper said was a transcript of the exchanges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-election-win-economic-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:01:35Z","webTitle":"Greek PM’s election win driven by recovery from economic crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-election-win-economic-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-election-win-economic-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Greek PM’s election win driven by recovery from economic crisis","bodyText":"If voters handed the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s conservative New Democracy party a thumping 20-point win and its best result since 2007 on Sunday, it was at least partly because they credited him with steering Greece to economic safety. Three mammoth bailouts totalling €280bn averted disaster during a decade-long crisis that reached its peak in 2015, and Greece only emerged from a draconian regime of spending controls ordered by its international lenders last summer. The human cost was immense. Unemployment peaked at 27.5% – and at 58% for the under-25s – as Greece’s economy shrank by 25% in what economists now agree was a downturn that hit the country as hard as the Great Depression of the 1930s hit the US. In the five years from 2008 to 2013, Greeks became on average 40% poorer, according to data from the country’s statistical agency analysed by Reuters. By 2014, disposable household income in Greece had sunk below 2003 levels. With unemployment soaring, many households became reliant on the pensions of older family members to survive – but repeated cuts left 45% of pensioners receiving monthly payments below the poverty line of €665 by 2015. That year, one in five Greeks were assessed as experiencing severe material deprivation, more than double the 2008 figure, and almost 4 million people – more than a third of the population – as being “at risk of poverty or social exclusion”. An estimated 800,000 Greeks had no access to medical treatment after losing their health insurance through unemployment during the crisis. Cases of severe depression almost trebled and, according to a study in the British Medical Journal, the suicide rate rose by 35%. Greece also suffered a devastating brain drain. The population declined by 400,000 between 2010 and 2015, with a 2013 study finding more than 120,000 professionals – including doctors, engineers and scientists – had left since 2010. A subsequent study found that of all those who fled the country, about 90% had a first degree, more than 60% a master’s degree, and 11% a PhD. In his first four-year term, Mitsotakis – a 55-year-old Harvard-educated former banker – oversaw unexpectedly high growth, a steep fall in unemployment and a country on course to regain its investment-grade credit rating after years of “junk” status. Greece’s GDP has now more or less returned to where it was when it first defaulted in 2010. Unemployment has more than halved from its peak, and taxes have gone down – and pensions and the minimum wage up – for the first time since the crisis began. The conservatives say they have overseen the country’s largest infrastructure programme since 1975, with more than 2,300 projects under way across the country, including motorways, airports, ports and marinas. Things are still far from perfect. The severe recession and years of emergency borrowing left Greece with a huge national debt – it reached €400bn last December – and hit household incomes so hard they could take another decade to recover. Crippling austerity – tax rises, public sector wage controls, pension cuts – left many exhausted and sunk into private debt, low wages and job insecurity; last year, almost half of all Greek households could barely get by on their monthly income. But even if Europe’s cost of living crisis is biting harder in Greece than elsewhere, the country is still a long way from where it was a decade ago, when despair turned into riots on the streets – and for that, voters appear to have thanked Mitsotakis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/dorothy-milne-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:00:37Z","webTitle":"Dorothy Milne obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/dorothy-milne-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/dorothy-milne-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Dorothy Milne obituary","bodyText":"My mother, Dorothy Milne, who has died aged 92, was a doctor who began her career specialising in family planning and later became a specialist in sexual health. In retirement she was a committed charity worker supporting women who have experienced trauma, crisis and exploitation. Born in Glasgow, Dorothy grew up in Aberdeen, attending Aberdeen high school for girls and gaining a scholarship to study medicine at Aberdeen University. There she met Ronald Milne, an engineer, and they married in 1955. The couple moved to Stevenage in Hertfordshire, where Dorothy became a school medical officer. She was soon approached to work for the Family Planning Association, which then only served married women. Dorothy then met the pioneering family planning adviser Helen Brook, and helped her to set up the first Brook Clinic in 1964, revolutionary in offering family planning to all women. By then she and Ronald had moved to Henham in Essex with their two young children, and Dorothy was juggling domestic responsibilities with evening clinics. In 1971 the family moved to Bristol when Ronald was appointed as professor of mathematical engineering at Bristol University. Dorothy continued her work at the Brook Advisory Centres, and also took up a post at the sexual health clinic at Bristol Royal Infirmary. She worked there for 25 years, during which time she also completed an MD. She was renowned for her calmness and humour – once disarming an embarrassing encounter with the family plumber at the clinic by saying: “you fixed my pipes, now I can fix yours”. On her retirement in 1995 the clinic was named the JD Milne Centre in her honour. After retirement Dorothy co-founded, and for the next 15 years helped to run, the One25 charity based in St Pauls, Bristol. One25 offered a safe space and support to sex workers on the Bristol streets via a night outreach from a converted van and a daytime drop-in centre. Her experience and knowledge were an invaluable element of One25’s success. Dorothy held a long-term Quaker belief and had many long lasting friendships across multiple generations. When Ronald became ill, she cared devotedly for him until his death in 2014. She remained true to her Scottish roots and love of the outdoors, swimming wild into her 80s, and was a keen gardener, birdwatcher and lichenologist. She is survived by her two children, me and Douglas, and three grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/22/phil-wang-review-all-kinds-of-funny-from-the-super-droll-standup","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:00:34Z","webTitle":"Phil Wang review – all kinds of funny from the super-droll standup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/22/phil-wang-review-all-kinds-of-funny-from-the-super-droll-standup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/22/phil-wang-review-all-kinds-of-funny-from-the-super-droll-standup","fields":{"headline":"Phil Wang review – all kinds of funny from the super-droll standup","bodyText":"There’s something for everyone in a Phil Wang show. Puerile jokes and sophisticated ones. Progressive jokes and conservative ones. New jokes – and revivals too, in a set that includes routines regular Wang-watchers will have seen before. But if they’re olden, they’re usually golden, in a 75-minute show that can only bolster the British Malaysian standup’s burgeoning reputation. You get a little bit of everything he’s good at tonight, as our host kicks off with cross-cultural, British-Chinese material of the type that made his name. As ever, in this riff on the British fear of re-heating rice, Wang casts himself as the equable Mr Commonsense perplexed by the eccentricities of those around him. That’s never funnier than with the routine (from his 2022 show The Real Hero in All This) about the propriety requiring nipples to be covered even when the, ahem, “boob blob” is exposed. Sometimes, those eccentricities are what you and I might call idealism: his sister refusing to eat octopus because it’s too intelligent, say, or cyclists seeking to traverse the urban environment without threat to their lives. I don’t always love Wang’s choosing to joke at these people’s expense – but there’s no denying he does so very entertainingly. In those cases, it’s about extrapolating the concept ad absurdum (if we base our dietary decisions on intelligence, where will it end?). Elsewhere, Wang gets laughs by sending up his own mild-mannered equanimity – with a great routine about not finding Kendrick Lamar’s lyrics relatable, say, which devolves into a joke concerning the N-word that’s more joyous than a joke concerning the N-word has any right to be. Even when the quality of the routine is questionable (I’m not sure if the set-up quite works for his onanistic one about fact-checking his recent memoir), Wang gets away with it because – particularly with his autobiographical material – he’s cultivated such a droll manner, forever referring to himself in the third person as if he were some #legend. Legend, he may not yet be: this isn’t a show that ever quite lets rip. But the gags, and the persona, are honed for your constant amusement.

Garret O’Boyle, a former FBI field agent turned purported whistleblower, testified last week to a congressional panel investigating what Republicans assert is the “weaponisation” of the federal government against conservatives. At one point, O’Boyle was asked by Democrat Dan Goldman whether Kash Patel, who held multiple roles in the Trump administration, is helping finance O’Boyle’s legal counsel. The witness replied: “Not that I’m aware of.” The answer has raised eyebrows because, during a previous interview with the House of Representatives’ weaponisation subcommittee in February, O’Boyle disclosed that his legal fees are being paid by a nonprofit organisation called Fight With Kash, also known as the Kash Foundation and run by Kash Patel. Furthermore, a Democratic staff report published in March notes that Patel arranged for Jesse Binnall, who served as Trump’s top “election fraud” lawyer in 2020, to serve as counsel for O’Boyle. Binnall sits on the Kash Foundation’s board of directors and has acknowledged working on past lawsuits funded by the foundation. In light of these details, Democrats are concerned that O’Boyle was not fully truthful before the committee chaired by Republican Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump backer. Lying to Congress carries a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment. Goldman told the Guardian: “Mr O’Boyle’s answers in the subcommittee hearing on Thursday appear to contradict his previous testimony in the transcribed interview with subcommittee staff. In order to ensure witnesses are truthful when they come before the subcommittee, Chairman Jordan must determine whether or not Mr O’Boyle lied under oath on Thursday.” O’Boyle was an FBI special agent from 2018 until earlier this year. He was among several former FBI employees who accused the bureau of politicisation at the hearing, which took place a day after the FBI announced that two of them had their security clearances revoked after either attending the January 6 insurrection or espousing conspiracy theories about the attack. The Congressional Integrity Project, a watchdog monitoring the Republican investigations, had previously noted that the witnesses on Thursday included anti-vaxxers, election deniers and supporters of far-right groups. Jordan and other Republicans on the committee hailed the ex-FBI employees as patriots who were facing retribution for speaking out against government abuse. Democrats dismissed the testimony, calling the hearing another partisan attempt by Republicans on the committee to help Trump. Stacey Plaskett, who represents the US Virgin Islands, said: “This select committee is a clearinghouse for testing conspiracy theories for Donald Trump to use in his 2024 presidential campaign.” In a series of contentious exchanges, Democrats complained that one of Thursday’s witnesses was only interviewed by Republican members of the committee. Many pointed to House rules that state minority and majority staff are required to have equal access to witness testimony, whether it is a whistleblower account or not. O’Boyle’s testimony could pile pressure on Jordan over the credibility of the weaponisation subcommittee, seen by critics as a brazen attempt to damage Joe Biden ahead of next year’s presidential election. Kyle Herrig, executive director of the Congressional Integrity Project, said: “Mr O’Boyle’s testimony in this week’s hearing should be investigated immediately by Chairman Jordan’s subcommittee. The fact that O’Boyle’s own lawyer has such deep ties to Kash Patel, a January 6 co-conspirator and close ally of Donald Trump, is already enough to call any of his testimony into question.” Jordan’s office denies that O’Boyle lied under oath. Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the chairman, said: “Yet again the Democrats distorted the facts in their report on our brave FBI whistleblowers. Jesse Binnall is representing Mr O’Boyle pro bono.” Dye pointed to a transcript of O’Boyle’s interview in which Binnall sought to explain his role. Binnall told the subcommittee that “although Mr O’Boyle was not aware of this directly, his representation by counsel is actually not being paid by anybody because it’s pro bono”. However, Democrats rejected this argument at the time. They wrote in their report that “O’Boyle’s own testimony concerning his interactions with Kash Patel undercuts Binnall’s apparent attempt to distance himself and his client from Patel. “Committee Democrats note further that as recently as February 12 – two days after O’Boyle testified – Patel praised Binnall on Truth Social, calling him ‘Americas lawyer.’ Binnall and Patel appear to operate out of the same Alexandria, VA, office building.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2023/may/22/sausage-traybake-eves-pudding-budget-recipes-nancy-birtwhistle","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:00:33Z","webTitle":"Sausage traybake and eve’s pudding: Nancy Birtwhistle’s budget apple recipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/22/sausage-traybake-eves-pudding-budget-recipes-nancy-birtwhistle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2023/may/22/sausage-traybake-eves-pudding-budget-recipes-nancy-birtwhistle","fields":{"headline":"Sausage traybake and eve’s pudding: Nancy Birtwhistle’s budget apple recipes","bodyText":"When I spot a few apples in the fruit bowl looking wrinkled, dry and past their best, I have these recipes to hand to ensure they don’t end their days in the compost bin. Pork and apple are great together, and today’s traybake is minimal effort yet has maximum flavour – you can put in whatever vegetables that need using up. And if the oven’s going to be on anyway, maximise that energy and pop in this mock eve’s pudding at the same time. Oven-to-table sausage traybake (pictured top) Use pork, vegetarian, gluten-free or vegan sausages for this tasty, no-faff dinner. You can use any seasonal vegetables, too – I even cut cauliflower or broccoli stalks into chunks and add them to the mix. You will need a large roasting dish or tin – mine measures 30cm x 25cm x 10cm deep. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 1-2 tbsp oil 4 garlic cloves 8 sausages 2 onions 2 celery sticks 2 carrots 12 small new potatoes 2 apples (wrinkled ones are perfect for this) 2 tbsp brown sugar 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp mixed dried herbs, or 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh herbs (eg parsley, sage, thyme) 1 tsp dried rosemary or 1 fresh sprig rosemary, chopped 2 heaped tsp cornflour 250ml apple juice 250ml water 1 tbsp apple cider or malt vinegar 1 cup frozen peas 1 good sprinkle fresh or frozen parsley, to garnish (optional) Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the oil, garlic cloves (unpeeled) and sausages in a large roasting dish or tin, then roast for 15-20 minutes, until the sausages start to turn golden on all sides. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables, and pop them into a large bowl as you do so. Quarter the onions and remove the outer skin; cut the celery into 2½cm lengths; peel the carrots and cut into 5mm slices; cut the potatoes in half (there’s no need to peel). Peel and quarter the apples, then core them and cut each quarter in half widthways. When all of the vegetables are in the bowl, add the sugar, soy sauce and herbs, and give everything a good mix (I find it easier to use my hands). Remove the roasting dish from the oven, squash the garlic cloves with the back of a fork to release the pulp inside, then lift out the skins. Stir the vegetables into the dish, then return it to the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the veg are tinged brown at the edges and just tender when spiked with a knife. Meanwhile, spoon the cornflour into the base of a measuring jug, then whisk in the apple juice and water a little at a time, so there are no lumps, then stir in the vinegar. Remove the tin from the oven, sprinkle over the frozen peas then pour over the apple juice mix and pop it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes, so the peas heat through and the sauce bubbles up and thickens. Remove from the oven, sprinkle over the parsley (if using) and serve on warm plates. Mock eve’s pudding A great family pudding that makes the very best use of leftovers. Traditionally made using apples and topped with a sponge made from ground almonds, my “penny-wise” version uses stale bread in the sponge and wrinkled apples from the fruit bowl. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4-6 125g butter, margarine or spread 125g sugar 2 eggs 1 tsp almond extract 100g finely blitzed breadcrumbs 3-4 large apples 1 tbsp flaked almonds (optional) Custard, to serve In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar, eggs, almond extract and breadcrumbs with a handheld electric whisk until well combined. Set aside. Peel, core and slice the apples into the base of a gratin dish (I used a 23cm x 15cm x 5cm one) – add a sprinkle of sugar, if necessary, though if the apples are past their best, they should be sweet enough already. Spoon the batter on top, then smooth it out with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds, if using, then bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 50 minutes.

But I didn’t know if I was the right person for the job, you know?” Composer Brendan Angelides has never worked in video game music before. You might know him better as Eskmo or Welder, or perhaps as the mind behind the music of TV shows 13 Reasons Why or Billions. When Ubisoft approached him to be the composer for its sort-of reboot of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, Mirage, he had doubts. The game is set at the height of the Islamic golden age, and centres around Baghdad: a hub flowing with the lifeblood of a changing world, a cultural centre of art and science, old and new. “When I first learned that the new Assassin’s Creed takes place in 9th-century Baghdad, I was excited at the prospect of diving into unfamiliar territory,” he explains to me in the middle of a recording session, where the last organic elements of his score are being finalised by the New York Arabic Orchestra. “It was an opportunity to connect with a community that has a tremendous wealth of talented musicians.” But Angelides does not have Arabic heritage, and did not come into the project with a depth of knowledge about how music from that part of the world works. Ubisoft approached him because of the nature of the work he’d done before; similar to Jesper Kyd – the musical architect of the entire Assassin’s Creed series – Angelides is renowned for fusing the orchestral and the electronic, creating weird electronica that’s powerful enough to capture your attention but understated enough not to overwhelm. Perfect for a video game soundtrack, then. But he needed help. Mirage, like the rest of the Assassin’s Creed series, needed to be as historically authentic as possible … and an electronic composer from Connecticut knew he couldn’t do that by himself. “The first person I reached out to was my friend Emel Mathlouthi, who is a Tunisian artist and performer based in New York,” he says. “The next person I sought out was Layth Sidiq, who is an Iraqi-born Jordanian violinist and the artistic director for the New York Arabic Orchestra.” As we chat, that same orchestra is recording a track for the game behind us, and little teases of the emotive, minor key composition begin to lay the foundations for what this game is about: innocence, tragedy, madness, revenge. Sidiq understood Angelides’ motivations and introduced him to Akram Haddad, a Palestinian composer and orchestrator (currently a professor at the New England Conservatory) teaching Middle Eastern music. It was a match made in heaven: Haddad had taught western music while living in Jerusalem, and now taught Middle Eastern music out of New England. The game – primarily aimed at a western audience – needed to be familiar enough to western ears while incorporating Middle Eastern elements for historical accuracy. Haddad and his work sat at the intersection. We’re sitting in an isolated vocal booth in a disused power station relay in the middle of New York City, and it feels very apt. This studio is at the intersection of art and science, a huge building once used to divert power to downtown New York, hollowed out, now redressed and rebuilt to perfectly capture the sounds of orchestras, rock bands and pop acts from all around the world. The Power Station walls are decorated with albums recorded here: Bowie, Springsteen, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Diana Ross. And now, Assassin’s Creed. “Working with Brendan has been an amazing experience for me,” says Haddad. “He sought me out intentionally as a collaborator, and from the very beginning there was a strong sense of mutual respect and musical admiration.” Haddad notes that Angelides gave him a lot of freedom when letting him loose on the compositions the latter had worked on so far. “Throughout our collaboration, there was a great sense of camaraderie and a shared passion for creating something new and exciting,” continues Haddad. “It was clear that we both had a deep love and appreciation for music, and that we were committed to pushing the boundaries of what was possible in our respective traditions.” This is something both musicians kept coming back to in the interview: respect. Haddad repeatedly outlined his awe at Angelides’ “ability to blend electronic and acoustic elements in a way that feels both organic and cutting edge”, while Angelides could not overstate his appreciation for the way Haddad embodied “a sonic blend of western meets Middle Eastern”. The two men told me that they’re already talking about working together after this project. You can hear the evidence of this bond in the music. As unlikely as it may seem, the fusion of electronic and orchestral gels effortlessly with the fusion of Arabic and western. “When incorporating elements from Arabic music into a western soundscape, it’s essential to be mindful of the specific musical idioms and techniques that are characteristic of that tradition,” says Haddad. “For example, the use of trills, microtones, glissandos, and so on, can add a distinctly Arabic flavour to a melody, but these elements need to be carefully integrated into the harmony and overall texture of the piece to avoid sounding out of place, or forced. “At the same time, it’s also important to be mindful of the intended audience and musical context. If the composition is for a big-budget gaming project with a primarily western audience, it may be necessary to adapt the Arabic musical elements in a way that feels familiar and accessible to that audience. This could involve using more familiar western harmonic structures or incorporating Arabic elements in a subtle and understated way.” The Assassin’s Creed Mirage soundtrack is powerful. Watching the orchestra work towards the climax of one of the main pieces that was being recorded in the Power Station studio, I saw gooseflesh prick up on the arms of almost everyone in the room. A moment of eye contact between Haddad in the composer’s spot with the orchestra, and Angelides standing to attention in the recording studio, suggested that they’d nailed it with this take. Assassin’s Creed Mirage will launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/china-saudi-arabia-boycott-g20-meeting-india-kashmir","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:53:04Z","webTitle":"China and Saudi Arabia boycott G20 meeting held by India in Kashmir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/china-saudi-arabia-boycott-g20-meeting-india-kashmir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/china-saudi-arabia-boycott-g20-meeting-india-kashmir","fields":{"headline":"China and Saudi Arabia boycott G20 meeting held by India in Kashmir","bodyText":"India’s presidency of the G20 group of leading nations has become mired in controversy after China and Saudi Arabia boycotted a meeting staged in Kashmir, the first such gathering since India unilaterally brought Kashmir under direct control in August 2019. The meeting, a tourism working group attended by about 60 delegates from most G20 countries taking place from Monday to Wednesday, required a large show of security at Srinagar international airport. In 2019 the Indian government stripped the disputed Muslim-majority region of semi-autonomy and split it into two federal territories in an attempt to integrate it fully into India. Indian authorities hoped the meeting would show that the controversial changes have brought “peace and prosperity” to the region and that it is a safe place for tourists. India’s elite National Security Guard, including its counter-drone unit and marine commandos, were helping police and paramilitary forces to secure the event venues. China has said it will not attend, citing its firm opposition “to holding any kind of G20 meetings in disputed territory”. In April, Pakistan, which also lays claim to Kashmir but is not a G20 member, described the meeting as irresponsible. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Indonesia were also expected to stay away. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti claimed India had turned the region into the equivalent of the Guantánamo Bay prison simply to hold a meeting on tourism. She also accused the Bharatiya Janata party, the party of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, of hijacking the G20 for its promotional purposes. Last week Fernand de Varennes, the UN’s special rapporteur on minority issues, issued a statement saying the G20 was “unwittingly providing a veneer of support to a facade of normalcy” when human rights violations, political persecution and illegal arrests were escalating in Kashmir. He said the meeting risked normalising what some have described as a military occupation. The statement was criticised as baseless by India’s permanent mission at the UN in Geneva. It was India’s prerogative to hold G20 meetings in any part of the country, the mission said. India divided the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 to create two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Ladakh is a disputed frontier region along the line of actual control between India and China, and both countries claim parts of it. The chief coordinator for India’s G20 presidency, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, said on Sunday: “We have the highest representation from foreign delegations for the tourism working group meeting in Srinagar, than we have had in the previous working group meetings. “Our experience is that in any working group meeting, to get such a large turnout of delegates not only from G20 countries but also from international organisations that are part of the G20 is an incredible process. If you have to do a working group on tourism in India, we have to do it in Srinagar. There is no option.” Britain’s high commissioner to India, Alex Ellis, said UK representatives would be attending the meeting. At a meeting between Modi and Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, at the G7 in Hiroshima, the two sides discussed progress on reaching a free trade deal. India remains angry at what it regards as a lax UK police reaction to an attack on the Indian high commission in London on 19 March by pro-Khalistan extremists. Security has been stepped up outside the commission. The presidency of the G20 is rotated between members each year and the Indian presidency was always likely to prove controversial as India has close trading links with Russia and the Modi administration is keen to protect Russia from criticism by western members of the G20 over Ukraine. Kyiv has asked to attend a summit in September but the Indian government is arguing Ukraine is not relevant to the state of the world economy – the central purpose of the G20 – or to its chosen key agenda items of inclusive growth, debt restructuring and climate finance. Vladimir Putin did not attend the G20 summit staged by Indonesia last year but instead sent his veteran foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/chelsea-fear-benoit-badiashile-will-miss-start-of-next-season-with-groin-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:47:48Z","webTitle":"Chelsea fear Benoît Badiashile will miss start of next season with groin injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/chelsea-fear-benoit-badiashile-will-miss-start-of-next-season-with-groin-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/chelsea-fear-benoit-badiashile-will-miss-start-of-next-season-with-groin-injury","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea fear Benoît Badiashile will miss start of next season with groin injury","bodyText":"Chelsea fear Benoît Badiashile will miss the start of next season after the defender sustained a groin injury in training last week. There were initial hopes the injury was not serious, but further tests have indicated that Badiashile could be out for four months. The injury could require surgery, which would potentially lead to the former Monaco defender missing all of pre-season. Mauricio Pochettino, who is due to be announced as Chelsea’s new manager soon, would have to prepare for his first campaign without one of his key defenders. Chelsea are awaiting the results of tests. If Badiashile is out it would boost Levi Colwill’s chances of breaking into the first team. Colwill has spent the season on loan at Brighton and Chelsea do not want to lose the centre-back. Badiashile, who joined in January, is one of nine Chelsea players who could be missing for Thursday’s game at Manchester United. Chelsea have been overhauling their medical department since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club last summer. The number of changes has been a point of discussion in the dressing room. The long-serving head physiotherapist Thierry Laurent and the medical director Dr Paco Biosca departed earlier this season. Chelsea were missing 10 players when thrashed 4-0 by City in the FA Cup in January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2023/may/22/share-your-experiences-of-the-womb-condition-adenomyosis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:42:33Z","webTitle":"Share your experiences of the womb condition adenomyosis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/share-your-experiences-of-the-womb-condition-adenomyosis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/22/share-your-experiences-of-the-womb-condition-adenomyosis","fields":{"headline":"Share your experiences of the womb condition adenomyosis","bodyText":"BBC presenter Naga Munchetty has spoken about her struggles with the debilitating womb condition adenomyosis.

Yet, given the pulling power of a starry lineup of soloists, the concerto takes on a particular attraction for audiences. It was interesting enough that the Ukrainian-born Finn, Dalia Stasevska, was conducting the Hallé Orchestra for the first time – her actual debut at Manchester’s Bridgewater in the same programme the previous night – but it was the trio of cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, violinist Hyeyoon Park – replacing the indisposed Nicola Benedetti – and pianist Benjamin Grosvenor who brought in a packed house. There was certainly no grandstanding, rather they entered it in the intimate spirit of chamber music, with Stasevska helping set this up with an understated opening orchestral exposition. Thematic material, often introduced by the cello and answered by the violin, was most expressively phrased: Kanneh-Mason and Park were well matched in sweetness of tone, with Grosvenor’s crystalline playing adding elegant flourishes to complement the strings. It was in the final Rondo alla Polacca that both the trio and Stasevska showed their instinctive feel for Beethoven, underlining his wit and playfulness as well as musical grace. The discursiveness of the concerto offered a good contrast with the intense compression of form in Sibelius’ Seventh Symphony. Stasevska’s affinity with its underlying passion and organic flow was manifest, colouring everything so as to effect seamless transitions throughout, the moments of wildness then balanced by grandeur with its own implicit logic. The Hallé, sounding magnificent in this acoustic, were clearly in their element. Stasevska had preceded the symphony with Andrea Tarrodi’s Paradisfåglar II (Birds of Paradise II), a tone poem embracing Sibelius’s concern for the natural world. Inspired by a BBC Planet Earth film and originally conceived for string orchestra, Tarrodi conjures an avian world with chirruping, fluttering and trilling creating a colourful soundscape. Segueing into the Sibelius without a pause was a daring juxtaposition, moving from an exotic paradise into the stark simplicity of a line rising from a Finnish horizon. Stasevska achieved it all with flair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/fascinating-creatures-how-army-of-volunteers-fights-to-save-britains-bumblebees-beewalk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:36:36Z","webTitle":"‘Fascinating creatures’: how an army of volunteers fights to save Britain’s bumblebees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/fascinating-creatures-how-army-of-volunteers-fights-to-save-britains-bumblebees-beewalk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/fascinating-creatures-how-army-of-volunteers-fights-to-save-britains-bumblebees-beewalk","fields":{"headline":"‘Fascinating creatures’: how an army of volunteers fights to save Britain’s bumblebees","bodyText":"“If you want to look at bees, go to a city rather than the countryside,” says Sarah Hudson, and on a bright spring day in central London, it’s not hard to see what she means. Hudson, a retired accountant, is carefully picking a path through the overgrown gravestones of the historic Bunhill Fields cemetery, pointing out the bees buzzing through an abundance of wild and cultivated spring flowers. “Oh, there we go, yes, lovely!” says Hudson, gesturing towards a fat, fuzzy bumblebee that has settled on a small, bright blue flower. “That’s a buff-tailed worker. As you can see they dwell on the flower for quite a long time”, she says as it flies off casually in search of more nectar. Though she regularly helps maintain the grounds, once a month Hudson comes here specifically to count bumblebees, tracing the same path, at the same pace, and noting the number, species and whereabouts of every bumblebee she sees. As such, she is one of an army of people at the forefront of conservation efforts to save one of Britain’s best-loved creatures. However plentiful they may be in this tiny urban idyll, times are tough farther afield for the British bumblebee. “Basically, the numbers are decreasing all over the shop for a lot of the [bumblebee] species,” says Richard Comont, the science manager of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, an organisation founded to try to arrest that decline. Its aim, he says, is “to get people a bit more switched on to the fact that these things are disappearing – and that ‘bee’ doesn’t just mean honeybee”. It certainly doesn’t. There are 270 different species of bee in Britain, 250 or so of which are solitary bees, which don’t live in nests or colonies, “and they generally do quite well”, he says. Honeybees, living in hives of 50,000 or more individuals, are now almost all managed by beekeepers, says Comont, “so looking after them is essentially not conservation, it’s animal husbandry”. Bumblebees, however, have “a perfect storm of difficulty going on” – living in nests of 100 or so workers “they’ve got an awful lot of mouths to feed for every breeding individual but only comparatively small nests”. Unlike honeybees, they do not roam far to forage for food. “So they’ve got a big job to do, and it’s not very easy for them to do it,” says Comont. Two bumblebee species have gone extinct in the UK in the past century – one of them only in 2000. Which is where Hudson and her fellow volunteers come in. Between March and October each year, volunteers walk a designated route and count how many bees they see, as part of an initiative called BeeWalk; after a little more than a decade, the trust now has a huge community of almost 800 citizen bee counters, and have amassed one of the largest bumblebee datasets in the world. It’s important, says Comont, “because if you look at abundance year on year, you can see a decline, you get that early warning, you know when you need to be doing stuff”. It is far from the only conservation body drawing on the immense potential of citizen science – the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, founded in the 1970s, is one of the longest-running insect-monitoring schemes in the world, while more than half a million took part in the RSPB’s Big Garden BirdWatch this year. Volunteers help monitor the national shoreline; others count reptiles in Cheshire, monitor hedgehogs in Cumbria or survey marine mammals and sea grass in the Solent. (Recent research has found that taking part in such projects is good for humans’ wellbeing, too.) Sadly, due to habitat loss and the changing climate, the news is not encouraging in many places. In the case of the bumblebee, more than half of British species are getting scarcer, including some that were once quite common. Wildflower hedges and verges are disappearing from the countryside, leaving bumblebee populations with too few and too small patches of flowery habitat. On the other hand, “gardens, window boxes, right the way out to estates, cover an area the size of Somerset in Britain”, says Comont, so from planting bumblebee-friendly flowers in a window box to allowing clover to grow in lawns to not immediately ripping up weeds (“essentially, volunteer wildflowers”), urban gardeners can play an important part. In Hudson’s case, having moved to the Cotswolds after her retirement and “absolutely hating it”, she and her partner moved back to central London where, from a position of almost total ignorance about bumblebees, she has now completed a master’s in ecology, specialising in the insects. “I’m still not an expert by any means. But they’re just absolutely fascinating creatures, for something so small. The things they can learn to do, because they are social animals. They are just amazing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/22/uk-government-sells-natwest-shares","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:32:50Z","webTitle":"UK government sells £1.26bn of NatWest shares, taking stake below 40%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/22/uk-government-sells-natwest-shares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/22/uk-government-sells-natwest-shares","fields":{"headline":"UK government sells £1.26bn of NatWest shares, taking stake below 40%","bodyText":"The UK government has sold a £1.26bn stake in NatWest, taking the state’s shareholding below 40% for the first time since the bank’s emergency bailout in 2008. It marks the sixth block sale of NatWest shares since the financial crisis, and brings the government one step closer to returning NatWest to full private ownership. The government has set a self-imposed deadline to fully privatise the bank by 2026, roughly 18 years after taxpayers spent £46bn to save NatWest Group, then known as Royal Bank of Scotland Group, from collapse. The bailout resulted in the government taking an 84% stake in the high street lender, with the latest block sale having reduced its shareholding to 38.6% from 41.4%. “This transaction reduces government ownership below 40% and demonstrates positive progress on the bank’s strategic priorities and the path to privatisation,” said the NatWest Group chief executive, Alison Rose. The current timeframe for the sell-off is twice as long as it took for the government to offload its holding in Lloyds Banking Group, which bought HBOS in a government-orchestrated rescue plan at the height of the financial crisis and was handed a £20.3bn bailout in return. Lloyds bought back the last of its shares from the government in 2017. The main reason for the delay is that the government is trying to avoid losing taxpayer money in the process of disposing of its NatWest stake. The Treasury said on Tuesday that meeting its 2025/2026 deadline would depend on how financial markets were faring, and whether it could assure “value for money for taxpayers”. Over the past decade, shares in NatWest Group, which has a market value of about £25bn, have tended to trade at barely half the average price of the bailout. The government said on Monday that it had agreed to sell 469m shares at a price of 268.4p each. That is nearly half the 500p that it paid for the shares in 2008. Last month, the government extended a separate plan to sell off a 15% stake in NatWest by drip feeding shares back into the market by another two years. It came after weeks of banking turmoil in March that led to the collapse of Credit Suisse and a handful of mid-sized banks in the US. Shares of UK banks were hit, amid fears over a fresh financial crisis. Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The UK government has now sold over half of its shareholding in NatWest, following peak ownership of 84% when it had to rescue the firm during the global financial crisis. “While the change doesn’t fundamentally change much about NatWest, other than giving it a little more flexibility over the capital base, the broader change is a symbolic one. Removing government stabilisers is a clear marker of the bank entering a new chapter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/22/arsenal-plot-move-for-manchester-city-captain-ilkay-gundogan-on-free-transfer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:32:32Z","webTitle":"Arsenal plot move for Manchester City captain Ilkay Gündogan on free transfer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/arsenal-plot-move-for-manchester-city-captain-ilkay-gundogan-on-free-transfer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/22/arsenal-plot-move-for-manchester-city-captain-ilkay-gundogan-on-free-transfer","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal plot move for Manchester City captain Ilkay Gündogan on free transfer","bodyText":"Arsenal are pursuing a move for Ilkay Gündogan as Mikel Arteta looks to reshape his midfield for a sustained title push next season. Gündogan is out of contract this summer and his future at Manchester City is uncertain. The champions are likely to offer him a new deal while Barcelona also hold a firm interest, but Arsenal have entered the running for his signature and the prospect of working alongside Arteta may appeal to the 32-year-old. The pair worked together during Arteta’s spell as assistant to Pep Guardiola at City, and the Arsenal manager has previous for persuading ex-colleagues to make the move south. Both Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko arrived from City last summer and made significant impressions in a team that ultimately fell short of taking the title race to the wire. Gündogan, though, has been more important to City than either Jesus or Zinchenko. He has been in brilliant form this season, scoring nine times and putting in a string of influential performances while captaining the side, and his arrival would constitute a major coup despite his advanced years. The deciding factor may be the length of contract available: Guardiola wants to keep Gündogan but the player is likely to require a deal of two guaranteed years if his spell in Manchester, which began in 2016, is to be extended. Arteta’s midfield will have room for a senior figure when Granit Xhaka, who is close to joining Bayer Leverkusen, departs after seven years at the club. Arsenal remain front runners in the race for West Ham’s Declan Rice, although they may face competition from Manchester United to close what will be an expensive transfer. Mason Mount, whose contract at Chelsea ends next season, is also on their radar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2023/may/22/tell-us-about-a-great-retreat-you-could-win-a-holiday-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:17:22Z","webTitle":"Tell us about a great retreat – you could win a holiday voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/22/tell-us-about-a-great-retreat-you-could-win-a-holiday-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2023/may/22/tell-us-about-a-great-retreat-you-could-win-a-holiday-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Tell us about a great retreat – you could win a holiday voucher","bodyText":"Whether it means going to a peaceful place, walking for wellbeing or heading to a retreat, it is important to have some time out.

A study to be published on Tuesday by LSE’s Grantham Research Institute examines how the stock market reacts to news that a fresh climate lawsuit has been filed or a corporation has lost its case. The researchers hope their work will encourage lenders, financial regulators and governments to consider the effect of climate litigation when making investment decisions in a warmer future, and ultimately drive greener corporate behaviour. The study, which is currently being peer reviewed, analysed 108 climate crisis lawsuits around the world between 2005 and 2021 against 98 companies listed in the US and Europe. It found that the filing of a new case or a court decision against a company reduced its expected value by an average of 0.41%. The stock market responded most strongly in the days after cases against carbon majors, which include the world’s largest energy, utility and materials firms, cutting the relative value of those companies by an average of 0.57% after a case was filed and by 1.5% after an unfavourable judgment. Although modest, the researchers conclude that the drop in the value of big polluters is statistically significant and therefore down to the legal challenges. “We didn’t know before if the markets cared about climate litigation,” said Misato Sato, lead author of the study. “It’s the first evidence supporting what was suspected before; that polluting firms and especially carbon majors now face litigation risk, in addition to transition and physical risk.” Researchers also found share prices fell more in reaction to novel cases involving a new form of legal argument or filed in a new jurisdiction. For example, when the Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Saúl Luciano Lliuya filed an unprecedented legal claim against RWE in 2015, seeking compensation for its role in causing historical climate change that threatens his home, the German energy giant’s relative value fell by 6%. It dropped again by 1.3% in 2017, when an appeals court allowed the claim to proceed. Another important case with a more complex picture was brought against Shell by the Dutch NGO Milieudefensie, which argued that the company had an obligation to reduce carbon emissions from its global operations, Shell’s relative value actually rose by 1.9% when the lawsuit was filed in April 2019. But two years later, when a court at The Hague ordered Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, it fell by 3.8%. Shell is appealing against the decision, but is supposed to comply in the meantime. The researchers found consistently larger effects on corporate share prices after the Shell case was launched “suggesting capital markets are increasingly responding to climate litigation”. There has been a surge in climate litigation against fossil fuel firms and other polluting industries in recent years, with many cases challenging corporate inaction on the climate crisis and attempts to spread misinformation, and companies are increasingly recognising it as a risk. BP, for example, has been the subject of numerous climate-related claims, including those brought against the fossil fuel industry by towns, states and municipalities across the US, which are inching towards hearings in state court. According to BP’s climate-related financial disclosures, published alongside its annual report in April, changes in law and regulation, as well as shifting social attitudes, could have “adverse impacts” on its business by making it more likely to lose court cases and exposing it to greater environmental and legal liabilities. Legal proceedings, it warns, “could reduce our financial liquidity and our credit ratings”. Legal experts told the Guardian they expected climate litigation to be a recurring theme in annual accounts as companies become subject to stricter disclosure rules. Sato said it was too early to say if litigation was driving substantial changes in climate action among big polluters, but evidence that lawsuits affected share price or credit ratings could help influence corporate behaviour. Andrew Coburn, the chief executive of the climate risk company Risilience, noted that defending a major lawsuit was rarely perceived well by the market, with expensive payouts and reputation damage causing short-term valuations to take a significant hit. “Risilience’s analysis suggests that damages could amount to 5% or more of a company’s revenue in the event of climate litigation.” Coburn added that the increasing willingness of regulators across the UK and Europe to clamp down on perceived greenwashing “demonstrates additional financial risks for firms failing to present credible, ambitious and realistic climate-transition plans underpinned by transparent data”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2023/may/22/whatever-comes-next-bayern-munich-must-rip-it-up-and-start-again-bundesliga-dortmund","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:07:27Z","webTitle":"Whatever comes next, Bayern Munich must rip it up and start again | Andy Brassell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/whatever-comes-next-bayern-munich-must-rip-it-up-and-start-again-bundesliga-dortmund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/whatever-comes-next-bayern-munich-must-rip-it-up-and-start-again-bundesliga-dortmund","fields":{"headline":"Whatever comes next, Bayern Munich must rip it up and start again","bodyText":"One of German football’s primary cliches is that of Bayern-Dusel – an undeserved helping of fortune that would help them somehow get it over the line in the last knockings, however well or badly they had played. A sense of inevitability. If you make your own luck in this game, though, Bayern Munich have not made nearly a good enough job of manufacturing any for themselves in recent weeks. For the champions, licking their wounds after Saturday evening’s stark, humbling home loss at the hands of RB Leipzig, Borussia Dortmund’s Sunday teatime victory at Augsburg was almost irrelevant, even if it did mark the chasers becoming the leaders with one game of the season to go – definitively taking the title’s fate out of Bayern’s hands. The mood, the level of introspection in Munich barely left a window for acknowledging Edin Terzić’s team doing their bit and getting set to take the title on next Saturday’s final round. This penultimate weekend of the Bundesliga had the feeling of a pivotal moment going back weeks; Bayern facing their most accomplished opponent in the run-in (and an opponent with something to play for) in Leipzig, with Dortmund travelling to a struggling team in Augsburg, just an hour to the west. For it to go quite this well for the latter, and quite as badly for the former, is more of a shock. BVB had their own psychological hurdles to jump. The sense that they were not used to dealing with the pressure of a genuine title race had grown in recent weeks as they tossed away a two-goal lead to 10 men at Stuttgart and failed to beat another cellar dweller at Bochum, the latter being when they last held pole position. There were nerves to conquer. Again they had the numerical advantage from the first half, when Felix Uduokhai was red-carded for dragging back Donyell Malen as he went through on goal. Dortmund had dominated a team still aiming to guarantee their Bundesliga safety – the shot count was 12-1 at half-time – but the jitters really started to creep in after Sébastien Haller put them in front with a smart finish from an angle. After a few scares, Haller’s second and a Julian Brandt strike finished it meaning if BVB beat Mainz at home next week, they will be champions. “It’s not magic,” said Haller. “It’s a lot of work.” For a team that was sixth at Christmas it is not far from miraculous, which is exactly how Terzić described Haller’s comeback from cancer. Yet it is Leipzig’s first win away at Bayern that will continue to resonate, and not just for what remains of this extraordinary season. It meant plenty for Marco Rose’s team too, ensuring their return to the Champions League next season when coupled with Union Berlin’s Saturday loss at Hoffenheim. They had trailed to Serge Gnabry’s wonderfully taken first-half goal but after Konrad Laimer – who will join Bayern in the summer – had thrashed the visitors level with 25 minutes to go, they didn’t even have to reach their best to find a path to victory. The manner of the equaliser was a case in point. Leipzig broke from a Bayern corner and as Jamal Musiala lost the ball to Laimer, they were briefly four-on-one, such was the lackadaisical nature of Bayern’s organisation. It wasn’t the slickest counter that Rose’s men have authored this season but once they did score, it felt as if there was only one winner. Leipzig had gently knocked on the door and watched as it fell off its hinges. After they took the lead from Christopher Nkunku’s penalty – the first of two Bayern conceded, taking them to nine penalties faced in the Bundesliga this season, a small window into their frequent defensive indiscipline – Mathys Tel had a half-chance, saved by Janis Blaswich. Yet the best opportunity fell to Nkunku, squandered on the break – again. Bayern were managing the feat of leaving themselves open on the counter while creating little in the way of chances. Dominik Szoboszlai wrapped it up with a second spot-kick. The talent is there for Bayern as ever, but the lack of leadership is striking. After David Alaba, Robert Lewandowski, Thiago and company (and with Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry watching on, casting a shadow of the strength of will of Bayern past), the brand known for their winning DNA just didn’t have the personality to react here. Again. “The [Joshua] Kimmich, [Leon] Goretzka, [Leroy] Sané and Gnabry generation stands for sporting mediocrity in the national team, and they won’t make Bayern advance,” chided Kicker’s Frank Linkesch in an editorial. When the club’s supervisory board meet on 30 May there will be a bill to pay, and the only question is who will be emptying their pockets. Oliver Kahn is under the greatest pressure though it cannot be ruled out that he and the sporting director Hasan Salihamidźić will split the burden. Continuity is generally a good thing, and has been one of Bayern’s greatest strengths not just in the last 11 years, but going back to the 1990s, when Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge began to work in tandem. That principle assumes, though, that there’s something worth hanging on to. Whether that is the case now is something weighing heavily on Munich minds. The increased presence of Hoeness at matches hints at a return to power and his good relationship with Thomas Tuchel suggests the coach will continue, even if the decision to fire Julian Nagelsmann looks increasingly misguided. The rebuild promises to be painful and expensive, with an elite defensive midfielder and centre-forward the minimum requirements. As Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Philipp Schneider noted, even Heidi Klum had her say, filming a stressed-looking Kahn from a few rows behind in the Allianz Arena and posting on Instagram (she would keep Kahn but get rid of Salihamidźić). This is full-on, inescapable, everybody’s-talking-about-it water cooler chat in Germany. And there are many more conversations to be had before Bayern are pointed back in the right direction. Talking points • Hertha’s relegation was finally confirmed by Keven Schlotterbeck’s stoppage-time headed equaliser for Bochum, which keeps the latter in the playoff spot. The Berliners still matter, as evidenced by a gargantuan crowd of 70,692 gathered at Olympiastadion for the last rites (“tell the mercenaries to piss off”, said one banner in that crowd) but they face a long road back. • Schalke had an incredible start against Eintracht Frankfurt with Simon Terrode, playing his last home game, heading them in front after 48 seconds but begin the final day second bottom after a 2-2 draw, needing to win at Leipzig to have any chance of escaping. Stuttgart, who owed their 4-1 win at Mainz to an impressive turn by substitute Chris Führich, are out of the bottom three. • On Friday night Freiburg, arguably, were the heroes of the weekend, with their deserved 2-0 win over Wolfsburg setting up the rest of the programme – not least motivating Leipzig to dig deep and ensure their top-four place. It is either Union or Freiburg who will take the final Champions League place; it will go to Berlin if Union beat Werder Bremen, barring a huge turnaround in goal difference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
