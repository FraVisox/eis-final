The lyrics capture the essence of Christmas. The birth of Jesus is part of a rescue mission, God throwing a line to humanity to save the earth from destruction. Bono's song echoes the one sung by angels to startled shepherds: \"Glory to God in the highest heaven and peace on earth.\" Two thousand years on, that peace is elusive, and the future stability of the earth is even more at risk. The Johannesburg Earth Summit of last autumn did little to help a world cursed by greed and diseased by national self-interest. The planet aches for peace. The audience of the angelic concert was made up of the poor, marginalised and socially excluded. In other words, shepherds. Forget the romantic rural heroes that front some Christmas cards. Shepherds were despised and distrusted. They were forced to live out in the hills guarding the owner's sheep from ravenous wolves. If you'd asked them what \"peace on earth\" would have looked like they'd probably have said: \"A world where the lamb no longer lived in fear of being killed by the wolf.\" Heaven on earth for a Palestinian shepherd would be a time when the wolf and the lamb shall lie down together. And that's exactly the vision God gave the prophet Isaiah hundreds of years before the arrival of Jesus: \"I am creating new heavens and a new earth ... where the wolf and the lamb shall feed together.\" Harmony within the animal kingdom would be a sign of the coming of a new earth. Another sign of this new world would be \"a babe lying in an animal-feeding trough\" or, as the carols sing, a manger. Nobody in their right mind would put a newborn baby in an animal-feeding bowl where the dog, goat and donkey munch their food. The baby wouldn't be safe. Except, this baby was special, anointed and different. His lying there amid the animals in a typical Palestinian home was a sign of the new kingdom where there would be harmony not just within the animal kingdom but between animals and the human family. The mission of Jesus was to bring about a new world where there would be peace on earth. His lying as a baby cheek by jowl with the animals was mirrored later in his life when he found himself befriended by animals in the wilderness. The Prince of Peace at ease with wild beasts. There's a picture of peace on earth. It was not animals, but fellow human beings that gave him grief. As Jesus walked the talk of God's love he faced rejection, humiliation and death. Humans killed his body, but not his grace. He rose from the dead with the words of angels still on his lips: \"Peace.\" Through extravagant love and belief-beggaring forgiveness he retains the power to put us right with God and with each other. Jesus holds the true secret to peace on earth. His spirit hovers over the face of the earth, silently seeking an entrance into the souls of all who ache with the whole of creation for that God-given peace. As we plead to Jesus to take the time to throw a drowning man a line: \"Hark! The herald angels sing / Glory to the newborn king. / Peace on earth and mercy mild, / God and sinners reconciled.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/dec/22/booksforchildrenandteenagers.features","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-22T05:52:13Z","webTitle":"Do we need another fantasy novel?

It seems we do","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Isabel Allende is doing it. Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) is doing it. Toni Morrison did it with her son, Slade. And now Michael Chabon, Pulitzer-winning author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, has written a children's novel, Summerland, which he calls 'an unabashed work of fantasy'. It seems that inside every grown-up novelist lurks a writer of children's fiction trying to get out. 'I've had the fundamental idea for Summerland since I was 11 years old,' says Chabon. 'I was inspired by CS Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, Tolkien and, above all, Susan Cooper.' Like Harry Potter, Chabon's unlikely hero, Ethan Feld is 11 - that magic, in-between age. He is also a terrible baseball player. Playing a game in Summerland, a perennially sun-kissed patch of the otherwise perpetually damp Clam Island, Feld's failures precipitate the unthinkable - the skies fill with cloud and the field is drenched. The downpour pitches him into fantasy; he is recruited by 109-year-old scout, Ringfinger Brown, and the ferishers (all-American, baseball-loving little people) to save the world from the evil, shapeshifting Coyote by playing baseball against giants, werefoxes, skrikers, graylings and more. Baseball is something of an obsession for Chabon. In his 1991 story, A Gift, baseball cards symbolise filial affection, transcending divorce and other casualties of modernity, such as artificial turf. His second novel, Fountain City, was to have been about baseball, too, but after several years' struggle, Chabon scrapped it in a sprawl of papers. From its ashes rose Wonder Boys, a tragicomedy about a writer losing his grip on his novel. Next came The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay - pulpy, picaresque, Pulitzer-winning - about a Brooklyn Jew who spins plots for comic books, and whose own life is peopled by feet-of-clay heroes, including his father, a circus strongman called the Mighty Molecule, and his lover, lantern-jawed Tracy Bacon. Chabon was born in Washington DC in 1963, and moved when he was six to Columbia, Maryland, an attempted utopia, furnished, before a single house was constructed, with a map of what its architects hoped it would become. As a child, he hung his map of Columbia next to one of Disney's Magic Kingdom and another of 'a world of horses and tall grass which I called Davoria'. Mapping is a very Chabonesque activity; in Summerland , he creates not one world but four, linked by a vast tree. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh, he took his MA in creative writing at the University of California. His thesis was The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, a coming-of-age novel. His tutor sent it to an agent, who signed Chabon up. At 24, he had his first hit. Floundering on Fountain City, he married, divorced and met his second wife, novelist Ayelet Waldman, on a blind date in 1992. Their three children - Sophie (seven), Zeke (five) and 13-month-old Ida-Rose - inspired him to return to the long-simmering idea for Summerland. Writing the novel on his strict schedule (Sunday to Thursday, 10pm to 3am) was, he said, 'one of the easiest, most pleasurable writing experiences I've ever had' and reminiscent of his first experiments as a writer. 'I began to play with the idea of being a writer when I was 10 years old, and laboriously typed my first complete work, a Conan Doyle pastiche called The Revenge of Captain Nemo. I put an explosion at the end.' Chabon's books are unashamedly directed at boys. It's as if he can flick a switch and remember exactly what it was like to be small. 'Sometimes,' he says, 'my writing draws on my childhood, sometimes it's just part of the underlying stew that educates me about the kind of stories I'm interested in. In Summerland, I wanted to write the kind of novel I'd have liked to read when I was 11. I loved fantasy, talking animal stories, in particular, the adventures of sentient mice.' Perhaps it was only a matter of time before he turned to children's fiction. He is prolific - between novels, he has written two volumes of short stories, several screenplays (including one for Curtis Hanson's tricksy film of Wonder Boys, and another for Kavalier and Clay, now in pre-production) and various (rejected) TV scripts. He refuses to get involved with the forthcoming film of Summerland because he is busy writing a new novel, Hatzeplatz, and there are two children's books in the pipeline. He sees little difference between writing for children and their parents, and laughs when I tell him about the sepia adult editions of the Harry Potter books. 'I guess we don't have that fear here - we very unashamedly read children's books. I was on a plane recently and one of the people next to me was reading one of the Potter books, another was reading one of the Philip Pullman books and another was reading a Lemony Snicket book. I think the boundaries have been blurred.' Lyricism is Chabon's trademark and he doesn't dumb down for his new readership. 'I tried to keep my sentences shorter - fewer dependent clauses - and I kept my vocabulary a little plainer, but it feels like my normal writing. It's had one review where the reviewer more or less said that the children of America are too stupid for this book. I don't agree and I think it's so offensive.' For market research, he read it to his daughter - 'she did fine'. In Summerland, the prose is rich and the puns potent and the love of language as apparent. It's a love he imparts not just in the roll and zoom of his prose, but also in throwaway characterisation such as the novel's crazy Aunt Shambleau, who lies in bed 'talking to herself in a strange, throaty language of which... he was the last living speaker on the face of the earth'. · Summerland is published by HarperCollins £12.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2002/dec/22/corporatefraud.enron","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-22T03:18:14Z","webTitle":"City lawyers defy courts over Enron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/dec/22/corporatefraud.enron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2002/dec/22/corporatefraud.enron","fields":{"headline":"City lawyers defy courts over Enron","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"London's biggest law firms are refusing demands from a US court to hand over documents relating to their work for Enron, the bankrupt energy trader. Clifford Chance, Linklaters, Slaughter &amp; May and Freshfields claim they cannot comply with the American request without breaching British rules on client confidentiality. The four firms - known as the 'magic circle' because of their pre-eminence in the City - have been served with subpoenas by Neal Batson, the US court- appointed 'examiner' investigating Enron's multibillion-dollar collapse. Under the terms of Enron's bankruptcy, Batson has been told to find misappropriated assets that can be recouped by the company. He is seeking information on all of Enron's transactions, including the notorious 'special purpose entities' that allowed it to hide its debts. There is no suggestion of impropriety on the part of the London firms, but Batson's move, which was announced in September, marked the first occasion on which they had been publicly associated with the disgraced Texan company. In the United Kingdom, lawyers can hand over confidential information without a client's permission only if fraud is suspected, and the firms are understood not to believe that documents in their possession indicate this. It is thought that the US court will not have the power to compel the London firms to surrender the material. A Linklaters spokesperson said: 'We are keen to help the US authorities get to the bottom of this. But they are ask ing for a lot of documents that aren't relevant. However, we will work with them to find out what information they really need.' Batson, who declined to comment, has subpoenaed a total of 45 law firms, most of them American. These include Vinson &amp; Elkins, the Texas firm that oversaw many of Enron's most controversial deals and is being sued by shareholders of the collapsed company. Batson is also targeting Enron's financial advisers and key employees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview2","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-21T23:41:01Z","webTitle":"Review: The Travels of Ibn Battutah edited by Tim Mackintosh-Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview2","fields":{"headline":"Even to the borders of China","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Travels of Ibn Battutahedited by Tim Mackintosh-Smith 325pp, Picador, £20 Ibn Battutah, the Moroccan who journeyed for a quarter-century across Asia and Africa on the eve of the black death, gives a picture of medieval civilisation without equal in detail and brilliance in The Travels. Translated from the Arabic in the 20th century by the orientalist scholar HAR Gibb and completed by the late Charles Beckingham, The Travels were available in English only as single volumes in the antique book trade or as inky pirate editions from India and the Arab world. This abridgement of the Gibb-Beckingham volumes by the British travel writer Tim Mackintosh-Smith is as good an introduction to the great masterpiece of Muslim geography as anyone could want. Shaikh Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Battutah was born in Tangiers in 1304, the son of a judge of the Maliki school of Islamic law, and himself bred up as a jurist. He set off eastwards at the age of 21. He seems to have intended little more than to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is a religious duty for able-bodied Muslims, and to practise the law. As he travelled east, his horizons began to open. In Alexandria, he dreamed of flying on the wings of a huge bird to Yemen, and then east and south, \"alighting in some dark and greenish country\". After performing the pilgrimage no fewer than five times, exploring Iraq, Iran and the Persian Gulf, descending as far as what is now Kenya and residing in the Christian capital of Constantinople, he passed by way of the Crimea, Central Asia and Afghanistan to the rich Muslim sultanate of Delhi, arriving in the early-to-mid-1330s. Dispatched in 1341 by Sultan Mohammed bin Tughluq with presents on a mission to the Emperor of China, ibn Battutah was wrecked on the Malabar coast and lost the presents. Rather than risk returning to Delhi, he set up as a judge in the recently Islamised Maldive Islands. Quarrelling with the civil authority after little more than a year, he made his own way to China by way of Ceylon, the Coromandel coast of India, Bengal and Sumatra. No doubt he wished to fulfil a famous saying attributed to the Prophet: \"Seek knowledge even to the borders of China.\" Returning to the Maghrib and Spain across countries ravaged by the black death, ibn Battutah made a hair-raising journey across the Sahara to the kingdom of Mali, which he completed in 1353. He covers as much ground as Marco Polo a generation before, but seems to have relied less on second-hand reports. (Both men's accounts of, for example, Chinese paper money are unsatisfactory and it may be that they used the same source or group of sources.) A summary of the Travels was completed on behalf of the sultan of Morocco by ibn Juzayy in 1356. Little is known of his later career. Ibn Battutah and Marco Polo were fortunate in their lifetimes. These were the years of the so-called \"Mongol peace\" in which the successors of Genghis Khan, having destroyed eastern Islam, including the city of Baghdad, had settled into generally peaceable principalities linked by open trade routes. Ibn Battutah's expertise in Islamic law was as saleable in territories newly brought within the Islamic fold as the Italian wares the Polos carried to the east. As a traveller, ibn Battutah is wholly convinced of the superiority of his own culture (Sunni Islam of the Maliki rite) but curious about other rites and even non-Islamic civilisations. China, with its vast cities, astonishing technology and unbelief, unsettles him; Mali he finds plain uncivilised. Pharisaical and even fanatical at the outset, ibn Battutah is softened by his adventures. He retains both his faith and his humanity. His personality is a war between contradictory impulses of mysticism and worldliness. Mackintosh-Smith prints the key passage, which occurs at a meeting in 1326 with a Sufi saint on the Shatt al-Arab near the town of Abadan (now the centre of the Iranian oil industry): \"For a moment,\" ibn Battutah writes regretfully, \"I entertained the idea of spending the rest of my life in the service of this shaikh, but I was dissuaded from it by the pertinacity of my spirit.\" This in Arabic is al-nafs al-lajuj: the relentless, importunate, animal spirit that the Sufi adept must overcome to advance in knowledge. In ibn Battutah's case, this animal spirit was a love of women. Even while performing the circuit of the Kaaba in the shrine at Mecca, he is tormented by the scent still lingering on the hot pavement. \"The Meccan women... make a practice of performing the circuit of the House on the eve of each Friday, and come in their finest apparel, and the Sanctuary is saturated with the smell of their perfume.\" Whenever ibn Bat tutah has any money - and he is an inveterate sponge on royal courts - he buys one or several slave-girls. In the Maldives, where he has fled the terrifying complications of the Delhi court to serve as a judge, he gives up on his attempt to oblige the local women to cover their breasts. On the mainland, he witnesses the practice of suttee, where a Hindu widow throws herself on to her husband's funeral pyre, and faints. Mackintosh-Smith, who lives in Yemen, published a book last year of his own journeys along ibn Battutah's tracks in the eastern Islamic world, called Travels with a Tangerine. This is the better book. He has weeded out much of the first three volumes of Gibb's text, including the lists of which learned men were resident in Mecca between 1326 and 1332, and topographical descriptions of Jerusalem and Damascus. In their place, he prints almost all of ibn Battutah's paradisal sojourn in the Maldives and the account of his capture by thieves near Aligarh in 1342. As he is dying of thirst, ibn Battutah's broad world collapses into a well without a bucket: \"I took a piece of cloth which I had on my head and tied it to the rope and sucked the water that soaked into it, but that did not slake my thirst. I tied on my shoe next and drew up water in it it, but that did not satisfy me either, so I drew with it a second time, but the rope broke and the shoe fell back into the well. I then tied on the other shoe and drank until my thirst was assuaged.\" There is nothing like that in all medieval literature. Mackintosh-Smith has kept many of Gibb's astonishingly learned footnotes, though on one occasion, in trying to pin down the Turkish-speaking tribes of southern Iran, he repeats a mistake of Gibb's and adds one of his own. The book's fault, which is not a serious one, is that Gibb began his stupendous translation in the 1920s and chose for it the orientalised English prose of 50 years before and the English verse (merles, ouzels) of 150. It is quite hard to be more prudish than an Arab traveller of the Middle Ages, but Gibb managed it. What Mackintosh-Smith conveys in his abridgement is the sheer scope, both geographical and mental, of Islamic civilisation in its climactic phase between the Mongol devastations of the 13th century and the revival of Christendom in the 15th. At Sijilmasah, a place now in ruins to the south of the Atlas mountains in the Maghrib, ibn Battutah stayed with a jurist whose brother he had met at Qanjanfu (Fuzhou) on the Chinese mainland. \"How far apart they are,\" he comments. · James Buchan's most recent novel is A Good Place to Die (Harvill Press)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2002/dec/21/weekendmagazine","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-21T19:35:33Z","webTitle":"Hang on, Santa, I'm tired!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/dec/21/weekendmagazine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2002/dec/21/weekendmagazine","fields":{"headline":"Hang on, Santa, I'm tired!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is a Friday in December. I have now been dressed as Santa for five hours. The heating in our house in on full-blast. The costume was itchy when I put it on all those hours ago. Now I feel as if I am covered in ants. \"I need to take the beard off,\" I say. \"No!\" yells Joel, my four-year-old son. \"I'm getting a rash,\" I say. \"Please stay with me, Santa,\" says Joel. The original plan - which I had devised during a lull at breakfast, when the conversation momentarily dried - had been to creep up behind Joel dressed as Santa. I'd say, \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" We would have a laugh about it, then I'd take off the costume and we'd go back to normal. But it didn't work out that way. Although Joel instantly knew it was me, he was so thrilled to have his own personal Santa that he didn't want it to end. Three hours ago, he whispered, \"Will you stay with me for ever, Santa?\" I replied, \"Yes, I will. For ever and ever and ever.\" \"I think I may be allergic to whatever fabric they make the beard out of,\" I say now. \"Don't go, Santa,\" wails Joel. \"Don't leave me.\" I give my wife, Elaine, an imploring look. She shrugs and goes downstairs to the kitchen. She thinks I have nobody to blame for this but myself. \"I think I'm getting hives,\" I say. \"I'm feeling very, very claustrophobic.\" \"No, Santa, no!\" says Joel. \"I need air,\" I gasp. \"I need air.\" I am having a panic attack dressed as Santa. \"Prepare yourself because I am going to take the beard off... now!\" I say, emphatically. I do. Joel runs from the room in tears. I go upstairs to my office for a cigarette. My plan is to give Joel the most perfect Christmas imaginable. This is part of my overall strategy to provide him with a constantly enchanting childhood. I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but I think I provide magical moments for Joel in a far more concentrated and unremitting way than my forefathers ever did. I rarely stop, only to go upstairs for cigarettes. This Christmas will be the summit of what is a perpetual endeavour. If this is (as I recognise it might be) a sickness, as opposed to good parenting, then I am not the only one stricken. Outside the school gates, all the parents speak of their plans to give their children the most perfect Christmas imaginable. I wonder if I'll bump into any of them in Lapland next week. One mother looks tense. She tells me that her four-year-old son asked her last night if he's going to die. \"What did you say?\" I ask. \"I, uh, said, 'You won't ever die,'\" she says. \"And then he said, 'What about you and daddy? Will either of you ever die?' And I said, 'No. We will never die, either. None of us will ever die.'\" She looks at me nervously. \"You did the right thing,\" I tell her. Sometimes, I think we may be crap parents, just crap in a different way from how our parents were crap. Later, I take Joel to a pre-Christmas party at a soft play centre. I am one of only two fathers there. All the other parents sit around the side, reading the papers and drinking coffee, but Joel insists I play with him among the plastic balls and rubber mattresses and slides. A little girl, presumably father-starved, jumps all over me. I attempt to push her away gently, as does Joel, but she follows us everywhere. Soon I give in and let her climb on top of me. At this moment, her mother notices us from the other side of the room. \"Nadia!\" she shrieks. \"Get away from that man!\" The mothers all stop what they're doing and stare at me. I am gripped by terror. Luckily, after a moment, an altercation brews in another part of the room, distracting people's attention. The other father present and his young son are fighting over whether the boy can fire a pop-gun at his father's head. The father insists he can't. The boy responds by screaming, standing up, pushing his father out the door, and slamming it closed. The father is left in the corridor. He chooses to stay there for the rest of the party. Nobody goes to check if he's OK. Is he sitting out there with his head in his hands? Is he pacing? How did we end up being so bad at parenting? We are like amateur minesweepers, for ever cutting the wrong wires. Our parents weren't like this, were they? When I was a child, my mother imparted to me a piece of advice I have never forgotten. She said, \"Life is a series of disappointments and you'd better get used to it.\" When Joel was born, I made a pact with myself never to talk of such things. Instead, I have taken on the grave duty of moulding for Joel a childhood that is something like The Railway Children, except both parents are around, we don't have to play at being poor, we live in London, and Joel is an only child, which might explain things. The pinnacle, this Christmas, will surely be our three-day trip to Lapland, where - the brochure says - Joel will take a husky ride, a reindeer ride, a snowmobile ride, a toboggan ride and, finally, meet Santa himself in a snowy cabin in the middle of a pine forest. The trip is two days away. As a precursor, I think about taking Joel to Santa's Kingdom at Wembley. The advert makes it look wonderful - a drawing of a shimmering, snowy, chocolate-box village somehow recreated inside Wembley exhibition halls 1 and 2. The official website includes a visitor's diary written by a seven-year-old called Mary T Moore. She writes: \"December 12 2002. We all checked in and were given our wristbands which were bright blue in colour! Elf street was kool. Santa was exactly like he is in all the photos and he does eat too much chocolate. We played in the snowball alley and mum went shopping.\" Although her diary was written about her December 12 visit, it was posted on santaskingdom.co.uk on November 29. This is unnerving. Could Mary T Moore not exist? Such marketing deceits are acceptable in the realms of everyday adult pursuits, but I am trying to construct a perfect Christmas for my four-year-old and I am in no mood to be fucked with. In the absence of actual foe to protect my son against, I am for ever attuned to the possibility of outsiders carelessly puncturing the ambience of constant enchantment that I have created around him. I decide to not tell Joel that we're going to Santa's Kingdom. I opt to make it a magical mystery tour instead. In the taxi on the way to Wembley, Joel excitedly cross-questions me for clues as to our destination. \"It is Body Worlds, isn't it?\" he says. \"Hooray! We're finally going to Body Worlds!\" \"It isn't Body Worlds,\" I say. Joel's face crumbles. \"I want to go to Body Worlds,\" he cries. \"Listen,\" I say, crossly, \"if you're naughty we're going straight into town to see Stomp again.\" \"No!\" yells Joel, genuinely alarmed. \"Not Stomp again. Please not Stomp again.\" This threat works for a few minutes. I notice that all my threats are funny ones. I do not have a single unfunny threat up my sleeve. Then Joel starts again. \"If we don't go to Body Worlds,\" he explains, \"I'm going to keep saying shit.\" \"Joel,\" I warn, \"we are not going to Body Worlds.\" \"You're worse than Jonathan King,\" he yells. The taxi driver peers suspiciously at us in his rearview mirror. I wish I'd never told Joel that Jonathan King - whose music Joel admires - is in prison for being naughty to boys. \"Shit!\" says Joel. I resort to the ace in my pack, the one thing that invariably makes Joel behave well. \"Jesus wouldn't have said shit,\" I say, \"and Jesus wouldn't have wanted to go to Body Worlds.\" Joel loves Jesus. I don't know where this came from, but I suspect it might be from a trailer for a cartoon called The Lamb Of God on the video of Scooby Doo And The Witch's Ghost. We are not a religious family. Like many people, I've relinquished pretty much every aspect of western living that could be described as \"being part of something bigger than myself.\" I am not a member of a union. I don't go to synagogue. The only clubs I'm a member of are the gym, where I don't talk to anyone, and the Randy Newman online fan club, which I rarely log on to. When I was a child, my father, like most people of his generation, spread his well of enchantment around the various clubs to which he belonged. He was a little enchanting at the golf club, a little enchanting at the bridge club and a little enchanting at home. But I concentrate the entirety of my enchantment on Joel. Santa's Kingdom turns out to be the most regimented snowy paradise I have ever been to. It is packed. We are shepherded by strict elves from one tiny room to another, where costumed actors sing us lame songs or tell us lame gags, before we are ushered on. Every few minutes, over the Tannoy, comes a magic-skewering announcement: \"Will the solid aqua wristbands please leave Santa's Kingdom NOW.\" \"I'm getting rather old,\" says the toymaker to the crowd. \"I'm beginning to think of Ann Widdecombe as a sexy young thing!\" There are blank faces from children and adults alike. Joel's mind wanders and he starts playing with the props. An elf magically appears at his side within half-a-second. \"Stay away from the toy machine,\" says the elf. Joel assents at once. He seems comforted by this unambiguous order. There are, in fairness, a few good bits about Santa's Kingdom: a wishing well that talks to you - not a recorded voice but a real conversation - and a snow slide we're allowed to go down exactly three times. Three little boxes on our wristbands are ticked offafter every go. But the whole thing is claustrophobic and the rigid structure squeezes all fun out of it. Had it been one vast kingdom, where we could roam freely, as opposed to a warren of little rooms with no grand climax, it might have been better. \"What Christmas present would you like this year?\" the toymaker asks Joel on our way out. \"Um...\" says Joel, frantically. \"Um...\" \"Oh good, lots and lots,\" interrupts the toymaker. He turns to someone else. \"A rescue castle,\" yelps Joel. But it is too late. We no longer have the toymaker's attention. There is a silence. \"Do you think he heard me?\" asks Joel. The afternoon before we go to Lapland, I take Joel to see Santa Vs The Snowman in 3D at the London Imax. When the snow falls, every child in the cinema sticks out their hand to catch it. I wonder how many of these children have, like Joel, never seen real snow fall. In the film, the lonely snowman, jealous of the attention Santa gets, imprisons Santa and delivers the presents himself, all of which are made of ice. He delivers an ice doll to a little girl, who drops it. It smashes on the floor. A tear runs down the girl's cheek. She's the picture of a heartbroken child. Joel looks at me, thrilled. \"My favourite part,\" he says afterwards, \"is when the little girl cried.\" \"Why?\" I ask. \"I don't know!\" laughs Joel, as if to say, \"It's crazy, I know, but that's just me.\" \"Was it because Santa turned up a few minutes later and gave the little girl a real doll that didn't break?\" \"No,\" he says. \"Did you just enjoy seeing the girl cry?\" \"Yes!\" laughs Joel. There is a silence. \"I certainly didn't take off my 3D glasses during that bit. Oh no.\" The worst-case scenario here, of course, is that Joel is a sociopath. But I have to be careful with worst-case scenarios. I have, in the past four years, misdiagnosed him as suffering from sleepy sickness, or Encephalitis lethargica to give it it's Latin term (he actually had a long lie-in); that disease where children get very, very old-looking in a matter of weeks (someone told me they couldn't believe he was four because he looked five); and Hand-Foot-Mouth disease (the NHS Direct nurse explained that nobody has been diagnosed with this rare ailment in 20 years. I told her that it wasn't my fault, and that the diagnosis, provided by the book What To Expect: The Toddler Years, seemed uncannily accurate. He actually had tonsillitis). Nonetheless, as we set off for Lapland, Joel's startling response to the crying girl weighs on my mind. Northern Finnish Lapland. Sunday night. There are five of us. This is a mini-arctic expedition. There is Sammy, our local guide and driver. There's Barry, the Guardian's photographer. There's Elaine. There's Joel. And there's me. It is 7.30pm. Sammy has just picked us up from Kuusamo airport. We have not yet reached our log cabin in nearby Ruka - our home for the next three nights. Instead, Sammy has driven us to an equipment-hire shop, a hut in a forest, where we are fitted with snowsuits. We run around outside for a few minutes, throwing snow at each other. Joel has never touched real snow before. He is amazed. But the seven-hour journey (two planes and a two-hour connection at Helsinki airport) has tired him out. \"Can I go to bed now?\" he asks the assembled adults. Sammy smiles enigmatically. \"Maybe,\" he says, \"there is something more exciting than sleep tonight. Maybe there will be an amazing Christmas adventure.\" \"First I'm going to have an amazing sleeping adventure,\" says Joel, cheerfully. \"Then I'll have an amazing Christmas adventure tomorrow.\" \"Maybe not,\" laughs Sammy. \"Maybe the adventure will begin tonight.\" I take Sammy to one side. \"What's going on?\" I ask. \"Joel must meet Santa tonight!\" he whispers, urgently. \"There's a horse-drawn sleigh parked outside your cabin right now, and it's going to take you through the forest to another cabin, and Santa is already there, hidden, waiting for Joel.\" \"Bloody hell,\" I say. Joel yawns, happily unaware of the unfolding crisis. Elaine has overheard some of this conversation, and she gives me a panicked stare that says, \"For Christ's sake, get them to postpone Santa.\" \"Joel's very tired,\" I say. \"Can we not meet Santa in the morning? We're jetlagged and we need to unpack and acclimatise ourselves.\" \"That is impossible,\" says Sammy, with startling finality. There is a silence. \"Perhaps the sight of the horse-drawn sleigh will perk Joel up,\" I say. The five of us climb into the minibus and drive through the snowy forest. We turn a corner, and all at once we gasp. Our cabin is covered in a blanket of thick snow. The surrounding pine trees glisten with snow, too, and a path of glowing candles lights up the driveway. A horse-drawn sleigh, complete with jingle bells and reindeer pelts, waits for us at the front door, as does the sleigh's driver. It is just about the loveliest thing I have ever seen. \"Bedtime!\" yells Joel. He jumps out of the van, ignoring the one-horse open sleigh, and rushes, focused, into the warm cabin. I follow him inside. He has already found a double bed and has jumped into it, pulling the duvet up to his chin. \"This is a perfect bed,\" he says. \"Good night.\" \"I think,\" I say, \"that somebody very special wants to meet you before you go to sleep.\" Joel thinks about this for a moment. \"No,\" he says. I hurry outside. \"Sammy,\" I say, \"we have a serious problem. Joel is already almost asleep. He's only four.\" \"We do have a serious problem,\" says Sammy, \"because Santa is only available immediately.\" Barry intercedes. \"Do you really want a picture of a scared, tired and crying child meeting Santa?\" he asks. \"No,\" says Sammy, \"but the schedule is inflexible.\" I notice, in the darkness behind the cabin, figures moving around. I don't know who they are. I assume they are shadowy cogs in this apparently complicated operation. I rush over to Elaine. \"They're not backing down!\" I hiss. \"Oh God,\" says Elaine. \"I'm not coming out,\" yells Joel from the window. I rush back inside. \"The horse is crying !\" I tell Joel, \"because he's dying to meet you. He's crying now!\" There is a silence. \"OK,\" he says, \"I'll meet the horse. But that's it. Then I'm going straight back to bed.\" Together, Joel and I walk out into the snow. \"Hello,\" says Joel, magnanimously, to the horse. \"Joel,\" says Sammy, \"would you like to sit in the sleigh for a moment while you talk to the horse?\" Joel shoots Sammy a suspicious glance. Nonetheless, he climbs into the sleigh. I quickly jump in and throw a reindeer pelt over the two of us. Elaine and Barry pile hurriedly in behind us. \"Go!\" I hiss. \" Go! \" The driver cracks the whip, and the horse trots lazily off down the snowy lane towards Santa. We fall into a wonderful silence. The jingle bells ring out magically with every step the horse takes. A stirring of northern lights pulsates above us as we ride through the shimmering pine trees. Joel's mood is lifted. He begins to sing Jingle Bells to himself. \"It's just so beautiful,\" I sigh. \"Isn't it, Joel? Isn't it perfect?\" Joel doesn't answer. Behind me, Elaine and Barry begin to bitch incessantly. \"Would it have been too much to have asked for a negotiable timetable?\" mutters Barry. \"It's just a nightmare,\" agrees Elaine. Barry and Elaine are working themselves up into something of a frenzy. \"People bring terminally ill children here,\" says Elaine. \"You don't force a terminally ill child to meet Santa.\" \"That's completely right,\" says Barry. We park up outside a log cabin and walk inside to discover that a vast banquet has been laid on for us. Joel takes one look at the meats and cookies and juice and salmon platter and he bursts into tears. \"You tricked me,\" he wails, throwing himself underneath a pine bench and adopting a foetal position. During crisis situations such as this, I usually attempt to alter Joel's mood by transforming myself into some kind of physical comedian, pulling out all the stops to provide instant enchantment. I use any prop to hand, interspersing my slapstick buffoonery by yelling out positive statements such as \"You're extremely talented, Joel! You're going to be a great success in later life!\" I consider rubbing salami on my head or humorously setting myself on fire with a Christmas candle. Instead, I whisper to Sammy, \"If Santa comes right now we may be OK.\" Sammy and I hurry outside to find a lovely old Santa, his eyes twinkling, rubbing his hands to keep warm inside a four-wheel drive parked behind a tree. \"Hello!\" he hollers. \"Let's do it now, Santa,\" I say. \"OK,\" says Santa. I rush back to the cabin and dramatically fling open the door. Joel, noticing an escape opportunity, squeezes out from underneath the bench and makes a run for it, just as Santa appears from the darkness. Joel skids to a startled halt. \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" says Santa. \"Get them to stand next to each other,\" urges Barry the photographer. \"I can't get them in the same frame.\" Santa takes a step towards Joel. Joel takes an anxious step backwards. \"He's demented with exhaustion,\" whispers Elaine through gritted teeth. \"You're the best, Santa!\" I holler as loudly as I can, trying to drown out all the negativity. \"They look like they're in different rooms,\" mutters Barry, panicked. \"Joel! Do you think there's a mouse living in Santa's beard? Would you like to go and look?\" \"This is making me very sad,\" says Elaine. \"Oh Santa, I'm so tired,\" says Joel, giving him an imploring look, as if to say, \"If anyone can stop this madness, surely you can.\" \"We all love you, Santa,\" I screech. Randy Newman was once asked about a song of his, I Love To See You Smile, the title theme to the movie Parenthood. \"It's the most lucrative song I ever wrote,\" he said. \"I was able to hire a nanny to play with my children for me. So a movie about being a good parent allowed me to put even more distance between my children and myself.\" I think about this as I attempt to coerce the exhausted and hugely reluctant Joel towards Santa so Barry can get a decent photograph to accompany my article on perfect parenthood, which will earn me enough money to pay for Joel's nanny for another eight weeks. Then I shrug and think, \"Things have gone too far to stop now\", and I ask Joel if he can spot the mouse in Santa's beard. \"Peace and quiet at last,\" says Joel, back in his bed in the log cabin. \"Wasn't Santa lovely,\" I say, trying to gauge the level of emotional scarring Joel has suffered in the past hour. Actually, he was a great Santa, a perfect Santa, unfazed by the chaos. Things did settle down after a while, with Joel telling Santa that his bedroom is the one with the two Harry Potter posters so he'll know where to leave the presents. But now, in bed, Joel's mind is on other things. He's thinking about a boy who is apparently something of a class bully. Two days before we set off for Lapland, by Joel's account, this boy shouted at him. In bed, Joel suddenly sits up and says, \"I'm going to have a horrible life.\" I gasp. \"No you're not,\" I say. \"You're going to have a fantastic life. Do you know why?\" \"Why?\" Joel asks. \"Because you're clever and funny,\" I say. \"Clever, funny people have fantastic lives.\" Joel allows himself a small, optimistic smile. Elaine listens, unnoticed by me, from the doorway. \"In fact,\" I add, thrilled that I'm doing so well, \"do you know which people have horrible lives after leaving school? Bullies! Bullies leave school and have horrible lives, while special people like you have blessed, magical lives, where nothing bad happens at all.\" \"Really?\" asks Joel. \"Yes,\" I say. \"Only bad things happen to bullies, and only good things happen to people like you.\" \"Those were the worst bloody words of wisdom I've heard in my life,\" shouts Elaine, furiously, later, over eggnog. \"What?\" I say. \"First,\" says Elaine, \"Joel won't automatically have a fantastic life. In fact, he'll probably have a worse life now because of the unrealistic expectations you've just instilled in him.\" \"Oh God,\" I say, horrified. \"He'll forget I said it, won't he?\" \"And bullies don't automatically have terrible lives,\" adds Elaine. \"What you just told Joel was warped and disturbing. You're teaching the boy schadenfreude!\" Before Joel was born, I had a mental picture of what fatherhood might be like: my son and I were in a car together, driving down a motorway. We turned to each other and smiled. That was it. I notice now that this mental picture lacked dialogue. I had no idea what we might actually say to each other. In this mental picture, neither one of us said or did anything that might screw the other one up. Joel is too excited to sleep. Elaine, Barry and I drink cognac in front of the fire while Joel bounces around in front of us. \"Shit!\" he sings, screeching across the room. \"Shit! Shit! Shit!\" \"Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy didn't say shit in Narnia,\" I say. \"You're good at the humour,\" says Barry, who has raised four children, \"but a weakness in your parenting is control. Control is the weak spot.\" \"Do you really think I'm good at the humour?\" I ask, flattered. \"Yes,\" says Barry. \"You said that in such a way as to imply that being good at the humour isn't enough,\" I say. Barry looks at me to see if I'm joking. When he realises I'm not, he gives me a brief, pitying stare, and says nothing about my parenting skills again. The next morning, Barry is worried. He never got a perfect shot of Joel and Santa together. He asks Sammy if the organisation can broker another meeting, this time with more advance warning. Sammy is concerned. \"But any Santa we manage to get now won't be the real Santa,\" he says. \"Uh...\" I say. \"Yes, yes,\" says Sammy, cutting my obvious next question short. He reluctantly agrees to find a Santa to meet us at the reindeer farm tomorrow. The next 24 hours are blissful. Sammy takes us husky sleighing. We drink reindeer soup in a tepee in a frozen forest. We end the day with a snowmobile expedition across a frozen lake. Joel sits on Sammy's bike, curled up between his legs. Joel has become besotted with Sammy. The next morning, Sammy drives us to a reindeer farm. The reindeer takes Joel and me on a hair-raising sleigh ride across a field, kicking snow in Joel's face. \"That's it,\" yells Joel, giving the reindeer and me a ferocious stare as if to say, \"I know the two of you plotted this together.\" I wipe the snow from Joel's face. \"I'm going to have a horrible life,\" says Joel. The reindeer farmer's son, who can speak little English, disappears at lunchtime. He reappears a few moments later dressed as Santa. \"Look, Joel!\" says Barry, raising his camera. \"Wow! How about that?\" \"Hello again, Santa,\" laughs Joel, excitedly. \"I didn't know you were coming to see me again.\" Santa nods, grumpily. \"I wonder if Santa has got a mouse living in his beard,\" says Barry. \"It's lovely to see you,\" says Joel. Santa silently folds his arms, diffidently tapping his fingers against his coat. \"Santa,\" says Joel, concerned, \"are you OK?\" \"Santa has reindeer problems,\" I say. \"Isn't that true, Santa? You've come to check on your reindeers because they're sick, that's why you're preoccupied.\" Santa grunts. Barry gets a lovely photograph of Joel posing with Santa. Twenty-four hours later, and we're back in London. Joel's nanny, Francielly, is feeding the cat. She's there when we arrive home. Joel runs through the front door. \"Our log cabin,\" he shrieks, \"had two toilets.\" \"Really?\" says Francielly. \"Two toilets!\" sighs Joel, contentedly. The next day I take Joel to see Santa Vs The Snowman again at the London Imax. I have been worried about how he responded to the scene of the little girl crying when her ice doll broke, and I want to see if he'll find it just as entertaining the second time around. In fact, he talks of little else. \"Do you think the doll will smash and the girl will cry again?\" he asks, as the lights go down. \"I do hope so.\" And, when the film gets to that part, Joel says, \"Hooray! I'm so glad it happened again.\" Later, I take Joel for a walk along the South Bank. I think I need to give him a lecture about empathy. \"The girl was really very sad when her doll smashed,\" I say. \"I know!\" laughs Joel. There is a silence. Then he asks, \"Could the doll never be fixed?\" \"Never,\" I say. \"It broke her heart. The doll could never be fixed and was on the floor in smithereens.\" \"So she couldn't cuddle it any more?\" asks Joel. \"She could never cuddle it again,\" I confirm. \"You're beginning to make me sad,\" says Joel. \"That's the thing about life, you see,\" I say. \"Bad things can sometimes happen. The thing to do is...\" And, at that, Joel bursts into tears."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2002/dec/21/familyholidays.london","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-21T18:25:30Z","webTitle":"Lapland comes to Wembley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/dec/21/familyholidays.london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2002/dec/21/familyholidays.london","fields":{"headline":"Lapland comes to Wembley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Storme has been dreaming of a white Christmas, just like the ones she's never known. My daughter may have seen 10 December 25ths, but she cannot clearly remember throwing snowballs, or sticking a carrot and some currants into a snowman's face. Christmas isn't Christmas, she mutters, without snow. Why wouldn't I take her to somewhere she could, for once, see the ground smothered in a white blanket and feel the flakes fall softly on her face? So we went to Wembley. It may not be the North Pole. But even when it drizzles on the half-demolished stadium and the adjacent multi-storey car park outside, a wonderful white Christmas is guaranteed inside at Wembley, where a labyrinth of life-size scenes from Santa's Kingdom have been constructed in the huge exhibition halls. The moment we entered, Storme knew her dream had come true. There was snow everywhere. It smothered the floor in a soft carpet, fell upon the fake fir trees with their little twinkling fairy lights, and landed upon the hood of Storme's red jacket, until she looked as if she belonged on the front of a Christmas card. It is unnaturally balmy in this particular Lapland, with a faint smell of hamburgers and hotdogs being fried. And the snow is dry and made of flaked plastic. But in Santa's Kingdom, we must suspend all disbelief. Cynics should stay at home; you are as unwelcome as Scrooge. At Wembley, you have to enter into the spirit not of Christmas present, but of Christmas past. The mode of transport to this mythical land is, however, modern. We are to be taken on an imitation shuttle ride Flight 501 (no passport required), 30 passengers at a time, guided by one of the 175 elves employed throughout the kingdom. \"Mum, are we really going to Lapland?\" whispered Storme as we boarded the shuttle, reaching for my hand. It seemed as if, for a brief and wonderful couple of hours, I might get my lovely daughter back, before she discovered lip gloss or that tooth fairies were fake or knew who Eminem was. \"Yep,\" I answered. Let this dream last, let this dream last, I said to myself. \"Will Santa be there, mum?\" \"Oh yes, darling,\" I said, delighted. \"I'm sure Santa will be there, just for you.\" We were all given pre-printed postcards: \"Dear Santa - I am... years of age. I want to thank you for your presents last year. I have been very good all year. Please Santa, this year could I have...\" How refreshingly sweet, how uncharacteristically innocent, I thought with parental approval. Perhaps I was despairing prematurely about how rapidly my 10-year-old seemed to be rushing into the off-hand rudeness and shrugging shoulders of teenagehood. She began to write her wish list on the postcard. I peered over her shoulder: \"Mobile phone and laptop,\" she had scribbled, and my softened heart began to weep. She was, after all, already tainted by the world beyond. Even when you enter a magical kingdom, you can't leave all your avaricious pre-teen mental baggage behind. Guided by elves, our group was moved from room to room, each decked out as a different scene inhabited by one of the kingdom's characters, played by actors. First, we met the Snow Queen in her ice cave. She asked us to cup our hands together and throw our wishes into the air, so she could catch them in her spangled cloak. We all did it, even the adults. But Storme had made the mistake of inviting along her friend Iona who, at 13, was not so easy to string along. Where Storme saw wonder, Iona saw manipulation. Where Storme hummed along to the taped \"Here it is, Merry Christmas, Everybody's having fun...\", Iona was silent. And it was Iona who pointed out that the illusion of being whisked away at the speed of sound to where Santa lives was slightly dented by a notice warning: \"No toilets for an hour.\" Santa's Kingdom is for ages 12 and under, or those adults who wished they still were. We all, except Iona, oooohed, aaahed, clapped and threw our wishes on demand. \"Boys and girls, you did very well,\" said the Snow Queen. \"But not a lot of the mums and dads joined in...\" There was oodles of audience participation. It was like a pantomime in which we had to walk from scene to scene. Even the jokes were wonderfully cheesy. The elves, we were informed, were very \"elf-ful\" (helpful, get it?). \"For your own elf and safety, please do not stand on the fence...\" chirped another green-faced elf. But this being the 21st century, a children's attraction also has to have an educational angle. So, in the toy factory, the Toymaker admonished, \"Elves have to go to the dentist if they don't brush their teeth properly. So, little boys and girls, do you brush your teeth properly?\" Then one of his elves - Dusty, I think - made all the children shout out that they would \"promise to tidy up their bedrooms\". I watched Storme shout out, too, and crossed my fingers in hope. We were ushered on to the Post Office, where Storme and the other children placed their postcards in a big red pillar box. In the Elf School, the Mad Professor warned the children gathered around his board that Father Christmas was fat because he eats \"lots of chocolates and sweets. They're bad for him. And he wouldn't be able to fit down the chimney. And we don't want that, do we boys and girls?\" \"NOOOOOOO!\" went up an almighty cheer from the 30-strong throng (except Iona). When we arrived at Santa's house, he was asleep; we could hear him snoring upstairs, and see the bedroom door shake with each snore. But his cup of cocoa and biscuits still sat on the table, and Mrs Claus was in. She told us stories of how difficult it was to wake up lazy old Santa when he had to go to work. We were cheered by the huge maps on the wall, some of the whole world, but mostly of London, so Santa would be able to find our house. Then we saw the sleigh, where Elder the elf was loading the toys. We could even pat the three real reindeer (with only one antler between them). Half Pint, the elf responsible for looking after the reindeer, told us something I didn't know: that Santa's sleigh is pulled by nine reindeer, each with their own name - Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Cupid, Comet, Vixen, Donner, Blitzen and, of course, Rudolph. In the village square, children queued up politely to get their very own silver bucket full of real snow - yes, real snow, which went all slushy and melted in your hands as you formed it into a ball and threw it at your mother. Then we queued for a toboggan ride down a big slope. \"This is Christmas!\" cheered Storme, as if she had never been able to say that before. We had been travelling through the kingdom for almost two hours, when an elf shouted, \"Who wants to meet the main man? The man in the red suit! That's right, girls and boys - Santaaaaaaa!\" Dear reader, at this point, anyone aged 12 or under, or those adults with the heart of a child, please turn away and read no further. At Santa's Kingdom, where the person who makes children across the world shiver with excitement on Christmas morning lives, there is more than one main man. In fact, there are 10, each allocated a darkened booth with its own discreet entrance. One of his elf-ful elves guides you to the one that is ready to welcome a child. They are so carefully concealed from each other that even the photographer, a 50-year-old with a five-year-old's heart, was convinced that he was seeing the only one. Storme, just as deluded, glowed as her one and only Santa handed over two cuddly toys dressed as wizards. Iona, keeping the mulitple Santas a secret, received a bubble making machine. She was delighted. But such belief in the fantastical cannot last long, even for Storme. Back home, the adult's cynicism returned, as did the inevitable child's Christmas squabbles and disappointments. I have warned my daughter that, despite her postcard, Santa will not be dropping a mobile phone or laptop down our chimney. And, despite her promise to the elf Dusty and however much I nag, her bedroom remains a tip. But for a few hours in the magical kingdom, I could believe almost anything. · There are Santa's Kingdoms at Wembley Exhibition Centre, Birmingham NEC and Glasgow SECC until December 23.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell yesterday accused Iraq of \"deception\" and \"lying\" in the 12,000-page weapons inventory it handed to the UN. In his first appraisal of the dossier, Mr Blix noted that Iraq maintained it had no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons programs \"and that none have been designed, procured, produced or stored\" since the last inspections regime ended four years ago. Mr Blix said that western governments claimed to have evidence to the contrary, but that inspectors were currently not in a position \"to confirm Iraq's statements, nor in possession of evidence to disprove it.\" The inspectors \"don't get all the support we need\" from western governments, he said. \"The most important thing that governments like the U.K. (United Kingdom) or the US could give us would be to tell us sites where they are convinced that they keep some weapons of mass destruction,\" he said. \"This is what we want to have. \"They have all the methods to listen to telephone conversations, they have spies, they have satellites, so they have a lot of sources which we do not have,\" he added.

The lavish art-nouveau decor of the Stahlbaums' salon gives way to frozen trees and icy wastes as Clara and her Nutcracker Prince make their way by troika to the barley-sugar twist palace of the Kingdom of Sweets. The production is amusing and gentle - even the demon multi-headed Mouse King isn't too scary - and gimmicks are kept to a minimum: Drosselmeyer (an elegant fakir from Igors Pavlenins) sprouts real flames from his fingertips, and the Christmas tree magically grows. The evening's appeal lies in its humour and the excellence of the performances. The company's young dancers are not just good technicians. They grab the choreography by the throat and dance with spirit and attack, travelling across the space with dazzling leaps and spins. The agile corps display dashing partnering in the ensembles, with the girls vigorously propelled like heat-seeking missiles. The arthritic antics of the creaking grandfather trying to cut a measure on Christmas Eve contrast wonderfully with the fireworks of the grand pas de deux. Tiny but power-packed, leading ballerina Julija Gurvica is a lively young Clara and a dazzling Sugar Plum Fairy, her body almost possessed by the voluptuous Tchaikovsky score. She has that rare ability to send chills down the spine: thrilling in the allegro movements, poised in the demanding balances, and at one point hurled from prince to cavalier like a Christmas parcel. Alexey Avechkin is equally impressive as the prince: tall and imposing, he is a shrewd partner and a fiery soloist.

The Scottish secretary, Helen Liddell, announced the decision yesterday and was immediately attacked for creating a logistical and electoral nightmare for Scottish voters. They will have to cope with different constituencies for devolved and Westminster elections. The move will also require legislation at Westminster. A reduction in the number of Holyrood politicians from the current 129 had been written into the Scotland Act to correspond with a cut in Scottish MPs at Westminster from 72 to 59, unveiled by the boundary commission earlier this year. But there were fears a reduction from 129 MSPs to around 108 could harm the devolved administration, still trying to find its feet after three turbulent years. All Scottish parliamentary parties except the Conservatives had lobbied vigorously to keep the status quo. Yesterday, Mrs Liddell told the Commons that she will set up an independent commission to look at problems which may arise as a result of the decision. She said responses to a consultation process on the issue had been overwhelmingly in favour of keeping 129 MSPs, and there had been fears the workings of the parliament would have suffered from any reduction. \"This acknowledges the fact that, as it approaches the end of its first term, the Scottish parliament is a hard-working and effective institution which is committed to serving the needs of the Scottish people,\" she said. \"It underpins the stability and success of the constitutional settlement in Scotland which has strengthened the United Kingdom.\" Some critics say the move will confuse the electorate, and could leave the devolution settlement vulnerable to further changes. The Scottish Conservatives said the decision was self-serving and designed to preserve \"jobs for the boys and girls.\" Scottish Conservative leader David McLetchie said: \"The Scottish parliament badly needs to be cut down to size to make it leaner and more focused, and concentrate on reforming our public services.\" The Westminster boundary changes, which have launched a scramble for seats, were required by the devolution settlement and welcomed by critics who have long said Scotland has been over-represented in the Commons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2002/dec/19/northernireland.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-19T02:34:37Z","webTitle":"Letter: Trimble hits back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/dec/19/northernireland.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/dec/19/northernireland.comment","fields":{"headline":"Trimble hits back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The tirade of personal abuse against me (The chutzpah of David Trimble, December 18) cannot be used to divert attention from the facts. It is a fact that the Labour party discriminates against all the people who live in Northern Ireland. It refuses to allow them to join the party. It allows people anywhere else, including the Republic of Ireland, to become a supporter, but not people in Northern Ireland. It took this decision in the 1920s under the apparent belief that Northern Ireland had become independent of the United Kingdom. Hopefully, this denial of civil rights will not survive the current legal action based on the Human Rights Act. When the prime minister spoke in Belfast in October, he identified as a defining characteristic of the age \"a complete intolerance of injustice ... [which] ... has no place in respectable politics\". He concluded that, \"the days of justifying discrimination are gone\". He may not be guilty of instituting this injustice, but he has been slow to remove it. Moreover, he been responsible for introducing fresh discrimination in the so-called 50/50 recruitment schemes for policing. Recently there was recruitment for civilian workers for the police. There were 276 successful candidates. But because only 26 were Roman Catholic, only 52 were appointed. The remaining 224 non-Catholics were victims of discriminations on religious grounds.

The immediate effect is that all four home countries are free to compete in the qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with qualifiers starting in autumn 2004. If yesterday's proposals had been approved by Fifa's executive, and then ratified, only one, merged side would have been allowed to represent the UK in global football from the summer of 2004. Blatter, who appeared firmly in favour of a unified UK team only 24 hours earlier, repositioned himself quickly yesterday after opposition that took Fifa's president aback. The six representatives of the European authority, Uefa, came out fighting, gathering support from among the three South American delegates on the 24-strong executive. By the end of the meeting, in which a 30-page document was discussed, Blatter was unequivocal in guaranteeing the long-term future of the independence - and Fifa voting status - of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \"Further discussion of this issue is taboo,\" he said. \"It is not to be touched - and it will not be touched. The situation of the members of the International Board, which guarantees the laws of the game, is secure.\" Blatter no doubt weighed up other political factors in opposing. The International Board comprises eight members, four from Fifa and one from each of the UK associa tions. Messing with its credibility would be too problematic, even for Fifa's president. Moves for a single UK side were backed by developing nations, which have long argued against its four-strong representation in the world game. But Blatter said: \"The position of the four British associations based on the contract drawn up in 1946 should be respected and maintained.\" In 1946 Sir Stanley Rous, then Football Association secretary, knew Fifa was virtually bankrupt and bartered proceeds of a 1947 Britain v Fifa game in exchange for a fixed British vice-presidency and maintenance of the four home nations. That vice-presidency, currently held by Scotland's David Will, also remains fixed - for the time being. A proposal for his post to be downgraded was deferred until March pending further examination. Blatter promised that Fifa's controversial finances were secure, saying: \"We will be 17m Swiss francs (£7.42m) in the red at the end of the year but that is only because of a change in our accounting system. Under the old system we would have SF100m equity.\" · Wales will play host to Bosnia in a friendly in Cardiff on February 12, the first-ever meeting of these countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2002/dec/18/2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-18T14:16:50Z","webTitle":"Matthew Norman's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/dec/18/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/dec/18/2","fields":{"headline":"Diary","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"· As the Cherie story finally seems to be burning itself out, we foresee a small but lively reignition in the spring. Cherie has been booked as a keynote speaker at the commonwealth law conference in Melbourne, from April 13-17, and she has already organised free flights not only for herself and the family on Emirates, the conference's official carrier, but also for a certain Carole Caplin. Alastair Campbell will be thrilled. By April, it seems likely that Peter Foster will have been flown home on the Australian taxpayer, so no need to book a berth for him. But what a chance for the old gang to reunite. Until the Emirates press office get back to us, the nature of the free tickets and their value will remain a mystery (my own hunch tends towards the very front of the plane). Also unclear is whether Cherie also plans to take her hairdresser Andre Suard, as she did at her own expense (£2,000) when she visited Ground Zero last September. · If the Emirates plane refuels at Dubai - and you wouldn't put it past the desert kingdom to want some publicity shots in return for the tickets - Cherie is directed to the world's finest duty free shopping. That most traditional of Labour symbols, Beluga caviar, is about £70 for a 250g tin - about a tenth of the price here. But don't be greedy! If customs catch you bringing in too much, they will take it under a rule designed to protect the sturgeon from extinction. · At 1.50pm yesterday the Press Association reported that the Iraqi opposition leaders had \"ended their talks on a post-Saddam future of their country and issued an agreed set of principles for the transition from dictatorship to democracy\". But what brought the 50 or so representatives of ethnic, political and religious groups, including the Iraqi National Congress's leader, to such sudden accord four days into their conference at London's Hilton Metropole? A tiny footnote in world history, perhaps, for hotel manager Marie-B Lallenand? The Iraqis wanted to continue the conference today, until she focused minds by telling them to leave promptly as the conference hall was needed for another booking. On such gossamer threads does the arc of world events turn. · Exciting literary news. My friend Stuart Bell, the Middlesbrough MP and ecclesiastic commissioner, has published his first novel since former Book of the Month, Paris 69. Now recovered from a depression provoked by his son's imprisonment for stealing from a fellow MP, Stuart's own imprint, Spen View Publications, brings us Binkie's Revolution, the first of a long researched family saga trilogy focusing on the socialist movement born in the British coal fields. It sounds a very long way from rough sex in Paris, and we hope to have a copy soon. · A day after we addressed the painful mass defection of Diary readers over perceived sycophancy to the Daily Mail, Andy Palmer emails a suggestion. \"I've had a great idea to help you bring back all your readers,\" he writes. \"Get Marina on the blower to Andrew Moncur.

Best wishes for your new career, and seasons greetings.\" · One columnist with no such worries, meanwhile, is Mitchell Symons of the Daily Express. All year, obscure website ifitsinthepress.com nominates a columnist of the week, totting up the votes and rewarding the annual winner with a free weekend in Gibraltar. With nine votes, Mitchell now has an unassailable lead (Richard Littlejohn, his co-author of the hilarious Essex Girl Joke Book, is joint second on six), and quite rightly Mitchell is eager to apprise his editor Chris Williams of this triumph.

British officials confirmed yesterday that a taskforce was being assembled for any possible military conflict, with troops, ships and specialist equipment being prepared in case Saddam Hussein defies UN calls to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Mr Hoon insisted the preparations did not mean military action was imminent or inevitable. But he added that parliament would not necessarily be given a substantive vote on military strikes if they become necessary. \"What we are doing is preparing for the event of military action being necessary,\" he said. \"But I want to emphasise that no decision has been taken to launch military action.\" If members of the security council judged that military action was necessary, the defence secretary said it was important that its members, including the UK, were in a position to take military action. \"It is for the security council to look at the report of the weapons inspectors,\" Mr Hoon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning. \"The UN security council resolution 1441 requires that there should be a further discussion amongst members of the security council, but all that does depend clearly on the findings of the weapons inspectors and the judgment that members of the security council make as a result of those findings.\" Mr Hoon added: \"We do not require the specific agreement of the security council. \"It has been clearly set out in security council resolution 1441 that there would be a further discussion of the situation in Iraq before any military action was launched. \"And obviously the United Kingdom, as a permanent member of that security council, would participate in that discussion. \"It is always the prerogative of individual members of the security council to take such decisions. \"We anticipate the need to go through the process set out in the security council resolution and moreover have not taken any decisions whatsoever about military action. \"Iraq has the choice, Iraq has the opportunity of deciding whether it chooses disarmament. \"We could certainly choose that course, but we would prefer a peaceful course through the process of the security council resolution providing Iraq chooses the course of disarmament.\" Mr Hoon, asked when military action was expected, added: \"I am not going to go into the question of days. What I am going to say is that we have made it clear to parliament over many months now that it is necessary to build up preparations for military action should that military action prove necessary.\" Mr Hoon said there was regular debate in parliament about possible military action. \"I am sure that before any specific decision to deploy forces there would be a further debate in the House of Commons. \"In the event of military action being necessary, we would not necessarily want to signal the timing or the date of any such military action in advance. \"It would depend on how events over the next weeks and months unfold in order that there should be both the security for our armed forces, should military action become necessary, and equally respecting the rights of the House of Commons to have a debate on this important question.\" The prime minister's official spokesman this morning echoed Washington's scepticism about the Iraqi weapons programme declaration. He said a full assessment of the document was not expected to be completed before the New Year. But he added: \"We have repeatedly said we are approaching this with great scepticism. \"There is nothing in what we have seen so far to change that view in any way.\" The dossier weighed in at around 10 stone and it may be the case that \"more is less\", he continued. Saddam's regime has a history of deceit over details of its weapons programme, he added. Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon would simply be confirming details of the preparation for war which were already in the public domain when he appeared before the Commons this afternoon, the spokesman said. He denied the government position on having a Commons debate and vote ahead of any action had changed. The foreign secretary Jack Straw had already told MPs that an \"element of surprise\" may be necessary, so informing parliament ahead of any action could be \"utterly irresponsible\", the spokesman said. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said: \"Once again the inherent ambiguities and unanswered questions which lay behind the government's position have been exposed. \"The British public is entitled to know if the government intends to operate exclusively through the UN or to take independent action without a UN mandate. \"The House of Commons is entitled to know if there will be the opportunity for a vote on a substantive motion before British troops are sent in to battle.\" Labour backbencher Alice Mahon, who has led opposition to a war, said MPs had rejected the idea of going to war without a fresh UN resolution in a recent debate. \"I think there would be a great deal of anger, not just in parliament but in the Labour party as a whole, if we went to war without a specific United Nations resolution,\" she told Today. Many MPs also believed there should be a vote in the Commons before military action is taken. \"Almost certainly, it will be raised at the PLP (Parliamentary Labour Party) this morning,\" she said. \"I think the government should come clean. \"They have already told us they are preparing for war. \"Now if you are dishing out contracts for cargo ships, that costs an awful lot of money. \"So I think this is a very serious situation going into the parliamentary recess.\" Ms Mahon continued: \"We can pester the government and say we insist on parliament at least being allowed to debate it.

Fifa is due to consider whether member countries should be members of the United Nations. The move would make the organisation more internationally coherent and end the sort of anomalies whereby China and Hong Kong had different representation. But one effect would be to reduce the four home countries to a unified joint membership as the United Kingdom, with a single national team. It is the first time the subject has been discussed but no decision can be made until Fifa meets in Qatar next October. If approved, it would take effect from the summer of 2004. The Football Association spokesman Paul Newman said: \"We would not want to comment until we have seen the proposals. They might get thrown out, after all. If they are approved then I'm sure we will take a view.\" However, sympathy may be lacking among football's developing nations, which have long envied Britain its four nations in the World Cup. Fifa will also consider a proposal to take away one of Britain's traditional privileges when it discusses the removal of the British vice-presidency. Britain was given the right to a vice-president after the second world war in recognition of its historical role in spreading the football message. The incumbent is Scotland's David Will, who upset Fifa's president Sepp Blatter this year by siding with Blatter's opponents in the Fifa election. Adam Crozier, the then FA chief executive, further upset Blatter with his outspoken attack on the Swiss official at the Fifa congress in Seoul.

That is the softer option open to the European governing body, which deferred a decision last month after the FA submitted a detailed dossier of its version of events in Bratislava, complaining that England fans were strongly provoked in an atmosphere of considerable intimidation. In fact, the FA is facing only one charge relating to the behaviour of England's travelling supporters whereas Slovakia has had to answer a wider range of allegations, including lack of organisation, ragged security and racist behaviour by their fans in the stadium.

But being asked to accompany a group of students to Education World I felt that the experience could not be as trying as other visits I had made in the company of teenagers hell-bent on having parts of their stomach come into contact with their nasal passages on gravity-defying rides. But I was wrong. Education World is an award-winning attraction housed in a converted abattoir somewhere between four motorways north of London and south of Birmingham. I'm not sure what award it won but it's probably for clever marketing. The complex promises a fun-filled day out in a magical world where learning and skills come alive. I must admit that I did enjoy the section that traced the history of training in the British workplace. All the students had disappeared to try something called The Learning Curve, a huge rollercoaster that involved being dropped from a great height while hanging upside down. This being a fate that I had wished many times upon my students, I enjoyed the quiet of an exhibition that explained how the Vikings were the first to implement work experience for their young. And did you know that the small boys who were sent up Victorian chimneys had to take an early form of key skills communication test so that they could be proficient in negotiating with other small boys they met up narrow flues? However, the map I was given at the entrance didn't make it clear how to get to the section devoted to further education. There was a red blob marked on a fold of the leaflet called The Further Kingdom but every time I thought I was going in the right direction I seemed to end up in a gift shop. I bumped into Roxanne, one of my more challenging students, outside one of the virtual reality game arcades. I was reading the list of warnings posted outside, all of which seemed to apply to me. Reluctant to remove the pens from the top pocket of my jacket (rule four) I hesitated by the turnstile. \"Don't be such a wimp,\" said Roxanne. Hearing her address me in such a polite way I was ready to listen to her advice. \"You can select lecturer mode, but it won't be much fun,\" she explained. \"If you get past the principal's bodyguards you can take him out with your laser. Actually, you'll just spend the game running along corridors waiting for things to jump out at you.\" I told Roxanne that this sounded too close to reality and asked her if she knew the way to the Further Kingdom. She advised me to follow the signs, which I did. But I ended up in the far corner of the complex where the crowds had thinned, in an area that was obviously still under construction. I came across one of the official guides having a cigarette behind a vending machine. His rubber blackboard costume reshaped itself as I approached. There were other people in themed outfits skulking nearby. An oversized foam Charles Clarke pointed me in the right direction. Eventually I found the Further Kingdom. But it wasn't worth the journey. There was a sign over the entrance saying that it was closed owing to staff shortages.

This rhetoric of disorder, depravity and decadence is the lingua franca of faith communities. It expresses the doctrinal need to balance their bleak explanations of original sin with promises of rapturous redemption. The imagery of Armageddon has a dangerous evangelical quality which is liable to be used by warmongers to provide sacred authority to their secular enterprise. It is time for a doctrinal regime change. There is nothing remotely apocalyptic about the present time. Rather, we are on the cusp of a most exciting and hopeful era, the age of enablement. For millennia the man in the street, the woman in the field, the child down the mine, the publicans, sinners and invalids were collateral in the grand schemes of the high and mighty. Gradually they have been manumitted; the slaves are free, women vote, young people have a childhood and a charter, homosexuality is permitted, the mentally unstable given a place, the disabled access. At home, a new social infrastructure is being put in place as the excluded take on ownership, through small-scale initiatives, with buddies, mentors, citizen advocates, careworkers, outreach, mediation services, personal advisers, community clinics, credit unions, grassroots multi-agencies. This is serious social capital and its \"interest\" is exponential. If Christ had been born this Christmas, it is unlikely that his parents would have had to seek sanctuary in a stable. There might not have been room at the inn, but there would have been many alternative refuges. In the wider world, the hungry are getting seeds, the thirsty wells, the naked sewing machines, the imprisoned advocates, the poor fair trade. These are the solutions of empowerment and they reveal the true nature of humanity; only people who themselves have been powerless could devise the hand-up option, in place of the hand-out solution. These are the hands-on builders of the kingdom; artisans who have no need of grand designs. Instead they use the simple blueprints handed down by the social gospel of respect for our fellow creatures and care for the weak. This good news suggests a dangerous perspective on human behaviour. We are indeed made in the image of God. Wrongdoing is the product of circumstance, not the attribute of creation, apple or gene. We are beginning to identify cause; we no longer stumble round the battlefields and ghettos of the world dispensing band-aid and blessing. We have begun to make the connections between poverty and power, disease and disorder, bombs and bread. We are offering joined-up solutions, and crying havoc on those who create the inequity and declare the wars. No longer conscripts in their schemes, we have realised our capacity for good. The fruit is already apparent on the tree, token of what can happen when the invalid and excluded are included and empowered. Control by the few gives way to enablement for the whole, while the ethos of competition and advantage yields to that of collaboration and benefit - the deaf lead the blind, the lame speak for the dumb. Enablement on this scale is a great feast indeed, and although it is not a comfortable process for religions, which are by definition concerned with containment, it is wrong of them to allow outmoded doctrine to keep them from its celebration. It was after all they who sowed the seed in good soil which has come to flower in stony ground. Yet while they perversely view God's children as originally cursed rather than creatively blessed, they are ill-dressed for the occasion. And disqualified. It is not simply perverse to allow the words which carry the good news to be translated from peacemaking into the language of mass destruction. At this season of God's incarnation which proclaimed an end to that prospect, it is a betrayal. · Stewart Dakers is a secular, street youth worker"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/dec/15/booksforchildrenandteenagers.bestbooksof2002","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-15T03:12:41Z","webTitle":"Christmas picture books: Dec 15","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/15/booksforchildrenandteenagers.bestbooksof2002","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/dec/15/booksforchildrenandteenagers.bestbooksof2002","fields":{"headline":"Look for those bear necessities","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I have had to reclaim, by stealth, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, illustrated by Matt Tavares (Candlewick Press £10.99) from my three-year-old son. He loves it partly, I think, because it is like being able to possess Christmas itself. The poem, served up each year, is as familiar as Brussel sprouts (said to be by Anon, but written, I am sure, by Father Christmas's PR people) and yet it captures the anticipation children feel on Christmas Eve. This is a lovely, traditional version - nocturnal engravings, charged with mystery. I particularly like the view of the sleigh and the galloping team of deer seen from the street below, as they take possession of the skies. (Suitable for all St Nicholas's customers). Twelve Days of Christmas by Rachel Griffin (Barefoot Books £10.99) is as decorous a Christmas book as could be wished for - and an antidote for families who feel that Christmas imagery has become too vulgar, exorbitant - or narrowly English. Rachel Griffin's book is jubilantly exotic (photographs of her own exquisitely stitched collages). Inspect her partridge, in its pear tree, against a radiant purple background, surrounded by silk grass and rare flowers. This book places Christmas in paradise - (and the accompanying CD sets it to music). This year, Christmas has been having a strange collective effect on children's book publishers.They seem to have become fixated by polar bears. One mighty white furry outline after another hoves into view in The Observer's book cupboard. But it is possible to sort out the bears from the bears and these have emerged triumphant: Albert Le Blanc by Nick Butterworth (Collins £9.99) is a most distinguished and melancholy French polar bear (I adore the cover illustration of his mournful backview). He looks so glum that the toys in the shop decide to cheer him up... but they are about to learn one of life's crucial lessons: never judge anyone by appearances. (3-6) Snow Bears by Martin Waddell, illustrated by Sarah Fox-Davies (Walker £10.99) is a charming game of hide and seek by three wannabe polar bears.They deck their brown fur with white snow - temporary snow coats. The game of pretending to have disappeared or to be unrecognisable is an essential part of every young child/bear's sentimental education. And there is a thaw at the end: big helpings of warm toast and mother love. (2 up) Snow Bear by Piers Harper (A Soft-to-Touch book) (Macmillan £10.99) took a while to read because I kept getting distracted stroking it. The bear is made of marvellous, elusive white velvet... mmmm... But the book itself warns against distractions, it is about a little bear who is so busy growing up that he nearly loses his mother. A classic plot, sensually played out. (2 up) The Polar Bear and the Snow Cloud by Jane Cabrera (Macmillan £9.99) is a charming tale about making friends. The polar bear's first friends are fickle - if only because they are all made of snow - and melt. It is an odd but touching idea, with a happy ending involving - at last! - a real friend. (3 up) There will be plenty of parents, in the Christmas season, who will find the next two books useful. Mummy Don't Go Out Tonight by Sally Gardner (Bloomsbury £9.99) is a darned good attempt to solve a problem. It shows a mother dressed up and ready to abscond, in a princess's dress. Her daughter ingeniously airs assorted fears and tries emotional blackmail to keep her mother at home. It is merrily illustrated but the beginning of the book, I fear, may ring truer than the happy ending in which the little girl has a ball with the babysitter. And we never learn how Mummy got on. Mrs Pig's Night Out by Ros Asquith and Selina Young (Hodder £9.99) is a less conscience-stricken, amusing take on the same subject. In the Pig family, Dad is the babysitter - and he is kind, tired and incompetent. The three piglets wind him around their little trotters. When the mother pig returns from her junketing, she doesn't miss a trick, and she clocks exactly what her husband has not done. But she is no fool, she knows when to keep quiet. Great fun. (For mothers everywhere). Two Frogs by Chris Wormell (Cape £10.99) is my favourite of the season: not that there is anything Christmassy about these two fellows, one of them armed with a stick. But they are comically present, unequivocally froggy, a little larger than life and their conversation is, in its simple way, philosophical - about living dangerously (and safely). For sophisticated five-year-olds and up. Billywise by Judith Nicholls and Jason Cockcroft (Bloomsbury £9.99). is a graceful story by Judith Nicholls and a little reminiscent of Jill Tomlinson's The Owl who was Afraid of the Dark, about an owl launching himself, learning to fly for the first time. But the illustrations are stunning: verdant, mysterious - and the baby owl is more thrilling than sentimental. A lovely book. (3 up) Pop-Up MiniBeast Adventure by Nick Denchfield and Anne Sharp (Macmillan £14.99) is not so much a picture book as a kingdom. It is about creepy crawlies and comes with a terrific portfolio of easy-to-assemble 3D models of scorpions, tarantulas, Goliath beetles and the like. It is ambitious, creative and can be read aloud or just played with: it has kept my boys creepily absorbed, intrigued and even lightly informed about the insect world. (4-8-ish) Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Book by Lauren Child (Hodder £10.99) is a wonderfully imaginative, postmodern idea. A boy called Herb falls asleep on top of his book of bedtime stories, and dreams his way inside it. He gets into all sorts of amusing trouble with bossy Goldilocks, ugly sisters, kindly tea-brewing Cinderella and all. Absorbing and with fantastical, zany pictures. But only for those already well-versed in fairy tales. (6-8). And finally those who like a little subversion at Christmas, need look no further than Big Mama Makes the World by Phyllis Root, illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Walker £12.99). Big Mama has chutzpah. You don't mess with her, as she throws the world together. 'Light,' said Big Mama, and - would you believe it - there was light. Mama is a stocky, celebratory woman who explodes like a champagne cork with delight at her own handiwork. We are told: 'What Big Mama wants, Big Mama gets. That's how it is.' And that is good enough for me.

On its very top is a three-roomed, brick cottage, roofed with tin, fronted by a slim veranda, and ringed by mud huts. And here, at 7am every morning, Goden Lev preaches the gospel. \"The Christian message is taking root,\" whispers the 84-year-old Norwegian. \"People's lives are being changed.\" If this sounds like pure Victoriana, it should. Four decades of ruinous mismanagement, and now four years of civil war, has returned the Democratic Republic of Congo to the 19th century. Congo the nation hardly exists. It is once again a vast forest with a river running snake-like through its middle. In its most isolated villages, people are returning to nakedness. And with aid agencies too fearful to venture far from a few small towns, Christian missionaries are, once again, often the only source of relief. To liberal minds, this might sound unsettling - and you don't have to be especially cynical to find some of the missions' statements absurd: \"Pastor wins more than 6,500 pygmies for Jesus,\" trumpets the Every Home for Christ mission (Colorado Springs, USA). But missionaries have unarguably done good in Congo. It was they who first reported the atrocities carried out by King Leopold of Belgium after he grabbed it for his personal kingdom - the slave labour, the amputations and massacres. In September, American missionaries led nearly 1,000 invalids on a jungle trek to safety after their hospital in northern Congo became a battleground. These days, Congo's missionaries are mostly upstanding, church-planting, American evangelists with names like Larry and Cathy, Donna and Clive. Lev is of an older generation. She sits straight-backed and a little stern on her veranda, wearing schoolmarmish, black spectacles, her grey hair neatly parted by a slide. A sentimental print of a rosy-cheeked angel rests on the shelf behind her, written in Norwegian, and surrounded by profane African carvings. In fact Lev's ancient Ford truck is about the only sign of change since David Livingstone's days; its tailgate bearing the legend \"Jesus Revient - 60km/hr\". A Baptist, Lev says she was called to her vocation at the age of 11, and has not suffered a moment's doubt since. She trained as a teacher in Oslo (\"I wanted to be a doctor but the Belgians had plenty of those,\") and, having been forced to wait for the war to end, boarded a ship bound for Cairo in 1946. From there she sailed up the Nile, arriving in black Africa at Juba, capital of southern Sudan. \"And I knew at once that I would spend my life among black people,\" she says. \"It was a Sunday, people were praying, and I decided I would happily die for these people, which I couldn't say for Norwegians. Though I was a little shocked to find everyone walking around naked - this was before I had married.\" A three-month trek through the forest brought her to a Norwegian mission in Bondo, a day's walk from her current post; and now only reachable by a six-hour light aircraft flight from Uganda. \"This area was very poor then,\" she says. \"There were no clothes, no schools, no bicycles. Almost nobody was Christian. We had a lot to do. The men preached, while the women worked as nurses and teachers. But soon the Belgians began bulldozing roads into northern Congo's forests, planting cotton and coffee as they went. \"By 1950, there had been a big change,\" says Lev. \"There was cotton growing everywhere, good schools, free healthcare; everyone was working. The first thing the men bought was a bicycle; the women bought sewing machines. It's not true that the Belgians never did anything for Congo. In Leopold's time they were brutal. But later they built roads, railways and ferries. There was business here. There was free education and healthcare for all.\" But what of the chicotte - a whip made of sun-dried hippopotamus hide which the colonials only officially stopped using on the locals in 1948? \"The chicotte was barbaric. I saw it used just once and it was horrible, its effects were terrible. But at least the Belgians usually only gave four lashes. Today the soldiers beat people 100 times,\" she says. For all their schools, when the Belgians abandoned Congo in 1960 (at two weeks' notice) they left only 17 graduates behind. \"That was their mistake and ours,\" Lev says. \"We had not realised that it takes more than secondary education - you need graduates. Congo was not ready for independence: we all knew there'd be trouble.\" Whether she is right that graduates alone would have spared Congo what was to come is debatable. Throughout the 1960s, thousands of young Africans studied at eastern and western universities as donors scrambled to create a class of African technocrats. Many of them - like Laurent Kabila in Congo and Jonas Savimbi in Angola - returned as warlords and thieves (if slightly bookish ones). In 1964, Lev and her husband, a Belgian missionary, fled Congo for Belgium, then Norway. Their mission had been ransacked as civil war swept the land. Back in Europe, she felt useless. \"It was a huge problem for me: I felt I had nothing special to offer there.\" Eventually she settled down to teaching children with special needs in Oslo, until her vocation brought her back to Africa in 1986. \"It had become clear to me that Africa returned to the same conditions I had first found in Congo, or maybe worse. So I decided to go back and see what good I could do.\" Returning as a widow, Lev had quite a shock when she reached Bondo. \"It was unbelievable, unrecognisable,\" she says. \"Congo was much worse than in 1946, much worse, much, much worse. A few people had become doctors or lawyers and moved away, but overall the place was a disaster. There were no bikes or sewing machines any more. There were teachers, but they weren't being paid and they weren't working. The cotton plantations were gone. The shops were gone. Everything had fallen apart.\" In 1992, Lev moved her mission to the hilltop village of Bili and set up a refuge for elderly women. Then in 1996, Rwanda sent its army into Congo from the east, nominally under Kabila's command. \"As the government troops fled past, they pillaged us. When Kabila's men arrived, they pillaged us too,\" says Lev dispassionately. As they passed, she fled into the forest with her congregation, spending her nights huddled around campfires to ward off lions. A year later she was back, having blown her savings on 18 tonnes of food, clothing and tools to rebuild the mission. \"No, of course I couldn't go back to Norway - a calling is for life,\" she sniffs, plainly disapproving of the question. \"Besides, if you go back to Norway when you're 80, there's nothing for you to do. Here, I could still be useful.\" Lev has had to flee into the forest twice more during Congo's current war - the world's biggest involving, at its height, armies from Angola, Namibia, Chad, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Congo. \"It isn't a bad life in the bush,\" she says. \"There's plenty of fruit and antelopes to eat, and my friends were always very kind.\" But after the last time, Lev had had enough. The next time drunken gunmen arrived in Bili, Lev stood her ground. \"I was sick of being looted,\" she says, raising her voice to a quiet shout. \"They'd shot someone and they were demanding money, so I went out to confront them. I gave them $400, and told them to clear off. It's not their fault of course: they're not paid a penny either. But I won't put up with their mischief any more. They understand that. When they beat people or start stealing, I summon them and tell them to stop it at once,\" says Lev, stabbing the air with a forefinger. \"They do as I say now - they say, 'Thank you for the advice, madame' - and they behave themselves for a while. They are scared of me, which is a good thing, because I am all the protection the people have.\" Over the course of the war Lev has poured her £700-a-month pension into Bili, building a clinic, a theological college and a church. At the foot of her hill, the walls of a 30-bed hospital are going up. \"Even if I have to live in the bush again for a while, I will not leave until my hospital is finished,\" she vows. \"It is nearly there, but I've run out of money. If someone would like to pay for it, that would be fine, otherwise I'll wait for my pension to come through and finish it myself.\" And that looks more likely: Lev has never tried fund-raising for her mission because, she says, \"I would hate to beg.\" If Congo's clinics have crumbled, clerics are in short supply too and Lev no longer has male colleagues to turn to. \"I preach to about 100 people here every morning, and to 300 or 400 in the church every Sunday,\" she says. \"I tell them about Jesus, but I also talk about Aids, about how to live peacefully as a family, about nutrition.\" Lev is sure her seed is taking root. \"Men who drank, stop drinking. Men who smoke, stop smoking. Men who had two wives, now have one,\" she says. \"Miracles are taking place here.\" I am doubtful, I tell her. What of an incident two years ago in nearby Zemio, when 36 people were burned to death for being possessed by the local crocodile demon? \"It was a terrible thing,\" she says, adding firmly. \"Atrocities like that are not Jesus's way. But I view it as a reason to carry on.\" Eventually, Lev says she will leave Congo. \"When I start getting old, when I fall ill, I'll go home to Europe to die,\" she says. \"I am Norwegian after all. But first I must finish my hospital.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2002/dec/13/artsfeatures.lordoftherings","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-13T02:03:24Z","webTitle":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/13/artsfeatures.lordoftherings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2002/dec/13/artsfeatures.lordoftherings","fields":{"headline":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There's no avoiding it any longer. It's time to drop the needle on the second disc in the biggest double-gatefold concept album in history: the next instalment in the Lord of the Rings saga, entitled The Two Towers. Warning! Film contains intense combat and fantasy horror scenes, long-haired men smoking unfeasibly long pipes, women with pointy ears, and lots and lots of interminable nerdish nonsense. When The Fellowship of the Ring came out last year I gave grave and unrecallable offence to the Tolkie fanbase with disobliging remarks about how the whole middlebrow mythology was dull and overrated, and how this admittedly beautifully designed children's movie was treated with baffling reverence by adults showing a misplaced, sentimental loyalty to their earlier, 12-year-old selves. Like a couple of other writers on this paper, I was deluged with hate mail. Some seriously claimed that \"Tolkie\" was an offensive slur. Well, L Ron Hubbard's writings became the basis of a bona fide religion, so perhaps JRR Tolkien's will too, and this sort of raillery will indeed become incorrect. I have had late-night arguments with pro-Tolkien friends, triggered off by rashly calling their need to establish an emotional relationship to this intricate but sterile world a symptom of regressive disorder. Do grown-ups need to worry their heads about Frodo and Bilbo, I asked - at which point the Tolkies mounted a very effective counter-attack, assaulting the boring Prousties for banging on about the mythic backstories of Baron De Charlus and Robert Saint-Loup. Touché . The Two Towers unarguably makes a powerful impression, and with this second movie the simple accretion of mass, together with director Peter Jackson's maintenance of its unflagging energy and his fanatical attention to detail, mean that the epic is taking some sort of shape. These persuasive elements strengthen what was always powerful about the first film: breathtaking use and creative modification of the New Zealand landscape, standing in for Middle Earth. And at the apex of The Two Towers is a tremendous battle sequence which Jackson puts over with full-throated gusto: the half-hour siege at the very end as the Dark Lord Saruman's forces assault the people of the kingdom of Rohan, who have taken their last stand at the fortress of Helm's Deep. But this is a three-hour film we are talking about, and for long, long periods of time the nagging question is - does it have to be quite so boring? The answer (which by the way is yes) lies in the fact that the classic values of clear, direct storytelling do not apply in the normal way. Jackson is forced to intercut between three separate plot-lines, a plate-spinning process which, though dexterously achieved, is inevitably laborious. We begin with the two hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) journeying towards Mordor to dispose of the Ring for good and all. They are pursued by the mysterious Gollum (Andy Serkis), a CGI-character with an unearthly resemblance to Dobby from Harry Potter. Captured by the two Hobbits, Gollum agrees to lead them to Mordor if they will release him. Meanwhile, in another part of the imaginary universe, the inexpressibly hunky Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) together with his Fellows, the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the lovable and stout-hearted dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) come to the aid of the people of Rohan, battling the evil Saruman. In this they are helped by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who has returned from the dead, dressed all in Persil white, and, like Saruman, now has Mary Hopkin tresses of snow-white hair too. Interestingly, the comic discrepancy in height between all these species is not emphasised as much as in the first film, with the exception of much knockabout fun at the expense of the bluff old soldier Gimli. Dwarves are obviously the Gurkhas of the Tolkien world. The third part of the tale concerns two jolly hobbits, played by Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd: Merry and Pippin - two pert names which show Tolkien's donnish desire to create an intensely English mythology; I can just hear him and the other pipe-puffing Inklings approvingly rolling \"Merry\" and \"Pippin\" around their tongues. They are captured in the forest by Treebeard, a very large talking tree, who stomps massively around with them in his tree-branch hands, achieving nothing very much in plot terms, until it is time for him to discover some tree-murdering vandalism, and, like Birnam Wood in Macbeth, the trees take up arms against the dark forces. The acting in all this is earnestly, effortfully bland. Just as in the first episode, Elijah Wood wears a permanent expression of pop-eyed awe, and everyone is utterly outclassed by Ian McKellen's Gandalf and Christopher Lee as Saruman, who despite appearing only fleetingly has a thousand times as much screen-presence voltage as most of the cast. McKellen, as ever, is a joy. He has real charisma; what a mystery it is that he has not worked more on the big screen. Gandalf is certainly the only character capable of being funny or impish without being heavy-handed. The only time when The Two Towers really convinces, when it actually involves you in its solemn world, is in that barnstorming final battle sequence. Great stuff, with echoes of Kurosawa - but even here the wilfully clotted, muddled narrative lets it down. The big finish at Helm's Deep is blurred by the action merging with a distracting cataclysm at Saruman's stronghold Orthanc Tower. Couldn't it have been simple, for once? So episode two finishes more or less where it began, with Frodo and Sam forging manfully - or rather hobbitfully - onward for their final confrontation with the enemy next Christmas, leaving behind only the mystery of how some people can, with a straight face, claim that all this represents a serious evocation of good and evil. It's been a very watchable, distinctive, if over-extended FX spectacular. Nothing more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2002/dec/12/artsfeatures.shopping","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-12T17:53:58Z","webTitle":"Art's obsession with shopping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/12/artsfeatures.shopping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2002/dec/12/artsfeatures.shopping","fields":{"headline":"Objects of desire","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Andy Warhol's portrait of Ethel Scull 36 Times is a tribute from one shopaholic to another. Everybody knows about Warhol's appetite for shopping, and the huge collections of stuff he left behind when he died. \"Buying is much more American than thinking,\" he said, \"and I'm as American as they come.\" A whole page of his book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, is devoted to an argument with a friend about where to go underwear shopping on a Saturday morning; Macy's (where Warhol usually got his underwear), Bloomingdale's or Saks? Ethel Scull was another super-shopper, but what she and her husband Robert most liked to buy was art. They bought the art of Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein. Robert Scull had made a fortune with taxis, and the couple used their money to put themselves at the centre of the art scene, anticipating Charles Saatchi in the enthusiasm and quasi-industrial scope of their buying. The Sculls wanted a portrait and they wanted it now. So Warhol took Ethel to a photomat, which pumped out 36 photographs of her, from which he made silkscreens. Ethel Scull 36 Times is a powerful, lyrical painting about movement, the illusion of movement. Snapped in a quick succession of random shots, the frieze of images is pop art's answer to futurism; just as Boccioni tried to capture the dynamism of a figure striding through space, Warhol conveys the vivacious energy of Ethel Scull. Except, because this is a Warhol, there is a sly and cruel wit. Broken up, considered separately, these faces are still, stilled, fatally pinned by the camera, deathly silhouettes like all of Warhol's silkscreens. The \"buzz\" of art as shopping, art as money, that this painting so ambivalently celebrates, is really just white noise. You become aware of shopping, and looking at art, as motion, as mall browsing, in Shopping, an exhibition that is travelling to Tate Liverpool from the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt. In Germany, you enter through a simulacrum of a German supermarket - kartoffelsalat, Bismarck herring and all. Except you can't touch anything. It's odd and confusing, not necessarily for the right reasons. But it does convey a sense of random and vague motion - the shopper promenading the aisles, looking for that absent something - that continues throughout this exhibition, from Warhol, Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg, to Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. Movement is a central aesthetic concern of 1960s pop art. European art in the Renaissance and baroque eras was fundamentally about movement, simulating the organic motion of human and animal bodies. In the American, and American-dominated, art of the 1960s, the most urgent subject matter was inorganic: things and, more specifically, things to buy. Pop art was concerned with shops, supermarkets, shelves, boxes, cans and bottles. It was about, as Warhol put it, \"comics, picnic tables, men's trousers, celebrities, shower curtains, refrigerators, Coke bottles - all the great modern things\". And yet it was not about them as mute objects. It was about their magical presence in the imagination, their fetishisation, their worship, the way that - just as the baroque artists painted saints so they seemed alive and human, and put tears on the face of a carved Christ - commodities, in the magic realm of their fetishism, seem alive. Movement, once the great business of high art, is also, and without irony, the business of pop art: how to capture the illusion of movement, of life, in stuff stacked in aisles. Movement is what is brilliantly, billowingly suggested by the gigantic dots of Roy Lichtenstein's paintings. The comic-book scenes that he transfigures on a booming, bright scale take on a Rubens-like energy and expansiveness: life blasts out at us from his paintings. And yet it is brittle. The gaudy colours and innocent dynamism carry a freight of vulnerability; the movement, as in Warhol's portrait of Ethel Scull 36 Times, is illusory. It is openly, explicitly fictive. Lichtenstein's paintings are meditations on painting's fiction of life. In European painting, the baroque, that religious 17th-century art movement in which the turbulent motion of God transforming and creating and punishing was paramount, invited its own parody, the rococo, the baroque secularised, the ethereal energy of the heavens mutating into a frolicsome space of erotic pleasure. Sex as movement. Pop art in America had a lot in common with the rococo. In fact, the first \"pop\" painting is Jean-Antoine Watteau's early 18th-century rococo masterpiece L'Enseigne de Gersaint. Watteau painted it as a shop sign for the art dealer Gersaint. It is a vision of shopping as erotic movement, as a sexy dance. Gersaint's shop is open to the street, with many fine oil paintings displayed as luxury goods like clothes or cakes, taken out of crates, lining the walls, demonstrated by shop assistants. A mirror in a gilt frame reflects the shoppers. They are the stars of this mercantile theatre, and they glitter and shimmer in their silk skirts and fluffy wigs, engaging in a dance of flirtation, ladies and gentlemen, people and paintings. The picture has a dream-like softness, its space, the space of the shop, is strangely yielding, as if the air itself is perfumed, as if the recessive box of the shop's interior is soft. As soft as the objects inflating and ballooning into a life of their own generated by the drawings and painted plaster sculptures of early Oldenburg. In 1961, Oldenburg opened The Store in New York, a low-rent, scruffy, humble neighbourhood store that he filled with imitations of ordinary, cheap foods, clothing, whatever a neighbourhood store might sell, but infected with fantasy, infused with organic life, as if by the imagination of a mad shopkeeper or deluded shopper. Oldenburg's sloppily sculpted and painted irons, cakes, trousers and ice-cream sundaes do not have the hardness and impermeability of glossy commodities behind glass. Rather they seem used, they are secondhand goods marked by the sad and febrile fantasies of those who have touched them before. Oldenburg and Watteau both picture the shop as a soft, yielding, penetrable space, an erotic emporium where desire is tantalised and teased, and where reality warps to our wishes. There is a gentleness to Oldenburg's art, a profusion of pinks and light blues. A tray of meats you would see in a butcher's shop - sausages, salami and pork chops all made of plaster and painted a blushing pink, flecked with white - seem tender and fleshy, but not violent. Ethereal, somehow. A display of plaster lingerie seems innocent, until you enumerate all the items and the pleasure he took in making them. Oldenburg's store goods have the magic, fetishistic presence of the ex votos you see in a baroque church in Naples - representations of limbs and stomachs and eyes laid before the Madonna. The powdered ethereality of the Watteau-esque shopping experience is a shopping beyond shopping. This is shopping to die for. Something similar is suggested by a pink-walled, ecstatic installation by Sylvie Fleury, in which boxes of expensive, high-heeled shoes have been left unopened. \"Pleasures,\" it says on the wall. The world of desire evoked here is the same place of communal utopian sensuality in which Watteau's art collectors linger - except this invisible shopper is solitary and narcissistic. This self-absorbed and affluent shopper might be the ideal customer dreamed of by Salvador Dali when he designed a window display for a New York department store. Dali's surrealism is another mutation of the rococo. The erotic mutations of the everyday objects he designed - lobster telephone, lip sofa - belong in the fetishised realm of the commodity. A coldness creeps in. The shop becomes a morgue: proprietor Jeff Koons. The Shopping exhibition includes a bright white cold room with some of his early pop classics: Hoovers, brand new, in vitrines. Untouched and smooth, Koons's Hoovers are the opposite of Oldenburg's shop-soiled fancies. Newness, the untouched, is the theme of Koons's top-of-the-line early 1980s Hoover models, arranged in illuminated cases as if they were new cars or designer bags. Koons's absolute kingdom of the object is the most radical pop art since Warhol's Brillo Boxes. He creates a world of desire, but there is a satirical rage, a vengefulness, to it. The shop through which Koons leads us is a place where we will never get satisfaction. The Hoovers are dead still; they are time capsules, they remain \"new\", trapped in the moment of their production in the 1980s. It's as if opening the plastic vitrines would let in air and the Hoovers, preserved like mummies in a tomb, would disintegrate. Shops are places to go, and so are art galleries. You look, you are seen. You keep moving. Moving makes you feel alive. The exhibition ends with Damien Hirst's Pharmacy. \"So if it's one in the morning and I'm still awake,\" confessed Warhol, \"I take a cab to the all-night pharmacy and buy whatever I've been brainwashed with that night on TV. I'll buy anything in a drugstore in the middle of the night.\" Here at the Pharmacy, motion stops, the mind is chilled, gelid like ice-cold vodka. The neatly stacked boxes of drugs are comforting and deathly. Well, where do you go when the shops have all closed? · Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture is at Tate Liverpool from December 19 until March 23. Details: 0151-702 7400.

Yes, it's my old friend Helen Brinton (Clark as is), the android MP for Peterborough. Whether or not with all those railway traumas in mind, Helen recently attended a briefing from the chairman of Cambridgeshire's police authority about police funding. This chap had planned to brief Cambridge MP Anne Campbell - who last featured here in one of the great Diary fiascos, oddly enough involving Cherie and a Commons parking pass of Anne's that never was put at her disposal - but discovered that Anne adamantly refuses to be in the same room as Helen at the same time. Some might say it does her credit that she's prepared to be in the same county. But not us. Here on the Diary, we know how tough it is for women like Helen to juggle all those balls, especially after a few large ones, and if the odd one crashes to earth who are we to judge? · Incidentally, we will be featuring an incident in which Helen did drop an orchestra (orchestra stall, ball; thanks to Boris the Jackal Johnson MP, as ever, for help with the rhyming slang) in our end of year review. We were hoping to string out this annual celebration of indolence and incompetence into the new year, but Marina has been through all columns up to October and finds only seven things even vaguely worthy of repetition. We are therefore thinking of contacting so-called rivals and asking them to chip in. · And so to Frederick Forsyth's Thought of the Week - one that seems oddly eager to bite the hand that feeds. \"I know jack-diddly about Cherie's flat-buying antics,\" he begins, winding up the big right hook. \"But the Guardian broke all known records trashing the story at first. Is this the Sentinel of Rectitude that hounded Aitken to oblivion through a dodgy hotel bill? Not lost our cutting edge, have we chaps?\" If that's a coded offer of resignation, Freddie, just forget it. You're the very last thing this column can afford to lose. · Back we go, then, to Paul Johnson's latest Spectator column, in which the seer describes in intimate detail watching a hydrogen bomb blast consume London from the window of his elegant Bayswater home. Eschewing anything so petty bourgeois as scene-setting, he comes straight out of the traps. \"The sounds of the explosion were so loud, so prolonged and so unusual that I knew at once I was listening to a historic singularity,\" begins my sane and rational friend. \"Indeed it may not have been an explosion: more a catastrophic globe event.\" Part 2, of 32, soon. · A reader forwards their Christmas card from Haringey council's Community and Police Consultative Group (Peace On Earth, the message reads in an impressive instance of lateral thinking), appending a comment of their own. \"I'd settle for peace in Haringey,\" they write, \"particularly after the big shoot-out in Green Lanes. Barbara Roche's part-time policemen approach is not working so far.\" Early days, early days. And thanks for reminding us to check how many hours Police Volunteer Barbie herself has been putting in, as she promised, down her local Crouch End nick. · Meanwhile, we get a card of our own from that bumptious little nebbish Harold Brooks-Baker at Burke's Peerage. \"Burke's Peerage extends Christmas greetings to all Imperial Royal and Noble families throughout the World and all their supporters,\" reads Harold's message. \"We wish them a happy, prosperous and secure holiday season and appreciate the support that they are giving to his Royal Highness al-Sharif Ali ibn al-Husain, the future King Ali of the restored Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq.\" Harold, just bugger off, would you, there's a good chap."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2002/dec/11/highereducation.uk1","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-11T12:32:42Z","webTitle":"Universities dismiss terrorist lab threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/dec/11/highereducation.uk1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2002/dec/11/highereducation.uk1","fields":{"headline":"Universities dismiss terrorist lab threat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"University leaders today dismissed claims by MPs that international terrorist groups could obtain lethal germ warfare agents by infiltrating Britain's university laboratories and other research bodies. The House of Commons foreign affairs committee believes terrorists could lay their hands on a range of deadly biological materials simply by signing up for postgraduate scientific research courses. It urged the government to establish a central authority to take responsibility for controlling all dangerous biological pathogens - bacteria or viruses that can cause disease - in the UK. \"We are concerned that existing measures to regulate the use of biotechnology research in this country may be insufficient to prevent dangerous materials falling into the hands of terrorist groups,\" it said. However, universities said the few pathogens that were used in university laboratories were not capable of being adopted for bio-terrorism. Dr David Secher, director of research services at the University of Cambridge, said he thought it was \"absolutely impossible\" that terrorists could get hold of the most dangerous pathogens, such as anthrax. \"The sort of dangerous pathogens that could be used for terrorism just aren't worked on in universities. Category four pathogens are already worked on under such strict conditions that universities don't do that kind of research. We must see this in perspective.\" The committee went on to claim that the UK vetting system for overseas students who would have access to dangerous materials, which is voluntary, was \"inadequate\" and needed to be strengthened. The system was set up after it was discovered that the head of the Iraqi biological weapons programme, Rihab Taba, studied plant diseases at the University of East Anglia in the 1980s. Diana Warwick, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, agreed that the system could be tightened. \"In view of the heightened security situation we would of course encourage all our members - within the provisions of the scheme - to refer students to the FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] where they have any concerns. But it's clearly appropriate that we look for ways of further strengthening the scheme, consistent with the voluntary principle. One way, for example, may be for the government to incorporate some of these aspects into the way in which it considers visa applications,\" she said. However, Dr Secher said stronger conditions attached to the vetting process could \"handicap\" the free exchange of ideas in the UK. It could, he added, prejudice against some of the brightest students abroad and put them off coming to undertake research in the UK. Although the government believes that none of the terrorist groups threatening the UK have so far succeeded in obtaining biological weapons, the committee said the threat of bio-terrorism had to be treated with the \"utmost seriousness\". It pointed to one Foreign Office report that estimated 100kg of anthrax released from the top of a tall building in a densely populated area could kill up to 3 million people. \"The level of threat to the United Kingdom from biological weapons must not be underestimated,\" the committee said. MPs also criticised the US for blocking an agreement on a new international convention to control the proliferation of biological weapons. \"The threat from biological weapons is a global problem, which - contrary to the view of parts of the US administration - cannot be addressed through national measures alone.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2002/dec/11/advertising","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-11T07:33:33Z","webTitle":"Japanese ad giant buys stake in London agency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/11/advertising","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2002/dec/11/advertising","fields":{"headline":"Japanese ad giant buys stake in London agency","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Japanese advertising giant responsible for David and Victoria Beckham's first joint advertising campaign has gained its first toehold in the British market by buying a stake in a London agency.

But in his own pond, Mr Durrani is a very large fish. And his pond - Pakistan's North West Frontier Province - has, since September 11, become a place of strategic interest. It is of more than passing concern, then, that when Mr Durrani was sworn in as the new chief minister of NWFP, he banned the sale of alcohol, put an end to all gambling and outlawed music in all public vehicles. No doubt Mr Durrani had sound reasons for these measures. Alcohol, after all, is banned in Pakistan, though it is a prohibition widely ignored. And if the ban on music carries echoes of the Taliban regime, Mr Durrani can argue that it was a safety measure. Music, he said, tends to cause accidents. But among his supporters, it was a promising start to honouring their party's promises: a ban on cable television and cinemas, and the enforcement of sharia law. Looked at one way, NWFP is a remote part of the world. Yet it is also a critical border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, inhabited by people who call themselves Afghan (otherwise described as Pashtun) and once the southern extension of the Afghan kingdom. Whatever happens in NWFP impacts on Afghanistan and vice-versa. What Mr Durrani thinks and does is of keen interest not only in Islamabad but in Washington, too. The irony is that the US and its ally President Musharraf have helped bring this situation about. The religious parties came to power on the back of two factors: Pashtun anger at General Musharraf's support for the war in Afghanistan, and Musharraf's desire to hold on to power while honouring his promise to hold elections. Musharraf excluded Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif from the elections, the two secular leaders most likely to win. And in the NWFP and Baluchistan, secular parties that supported the war are regarded with suspicion by Islamabad because of the capital's fear of local nationalism. They, too, lost to religious militants. Power was handed to men whose sympathies for the Taliban and al-Qaida had never been in doubt, men who had sworn to throw the US out of Pakistan. Mr Musharraf presents himself as a moderate, pro-western figure who has taken a stand against militant Islamism in Pakistan. Was it political incompetence, then, that facilitated the unprecedented success of the religious parties? Perhaps. But some observers see an advantage for Mr Musharraf in the new situation. Before September 11, he was a military leader whom right-minded democracies kept at arm's length. A week later, he was a key ally in the war on terror. Had a secular party won the elections, Musharraf risked being challenged internally and marginalised internationally. Now he is confirmed as the man the US needs more than ever to hold back the tide of religious extremism in Pakistan. As the election results were announced, EU observers called the process \"deeply flawed\". But the US state department spokesman, Richard Boucher, called it \"a credible representation of the full range of opinion in the country\". Back in the NWFP, Munawwar Hasan, a leader of the winning religious alliance, the Muttahida Majlisi-Amal, was elaborating his own version of stability and moderation. \"Taliban and al-Qaida members are our brothers,\" he said. \"Whether it is Osama bin Laden or Mullah Omar, we will not hand over anybody to the US without any proof. Our government will rule according to the Quran and Sunnah and not with the whims of the US.\" Of the 442 al-Qaida suspects arrested by Pakistani authorities since last year, 380 were detained in the northwest border region. Now both NWFP and Baluchistan are ruled by men who regard US policy as \"tyranny\". None of this is reassuring to those organisations in the NWFP who do support moderation - the human rights organisations, the NGOs and the secular political parties. In the last couple of years civic groups, aid workers and development organisations have been targeted by religious groups in NWFP: several have been subjected to grenade attacks. In Baluchistan, the new chief minister, Jam Mir Mohammad Yousaf, has released Islamist radicals whom Musharraf detained earlier this year when he banned extremist groups. The arrests were applauded in the west as evidence of his determination to eliminate sectarian killings and terrorism. It is in this hostile terrain that the US continues to hunt for al-Qaida fugitives. The FBI has reportedly now formed its own force of retired army, paramilitary and police personnel to pursue al-Qaida, in an attempt to bypass Pakistan's new political powers. The war on terror, in north-west Pakistan at least, is going to be a long one. comment@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/dec/10/londonreviewofbooks","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-10T18:09:29Z","webTitle":"Megan Vaughan on the daily life of a slave-trading ship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/10/londonreviewofbooks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/dec/10/londonreviewofbooks","fields":{"headline":"Trading lives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The 'Diligent': A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade by Robert Harms. Perseus, 466 pp., £17.99, 28 February, 1 903985 18 8 On 1 June 1731, the Billy brothers, Guillaume and François, waved goodbye to their ship, the Diligent, as it set sail from Brittany. It was weighed down with Indian cloth, cowry shells from the Maldives, white linen from Hamburg, guns, ammunition and smoking pipes from Holland, kegs of brandy from the Loire Valley, and with the all-important supplies for the crew: firewood and flour, dry biscuits, fava beans, hams, salt beef, cheese, white wine and water. There was one other item to be loaded: 150 slave irons with their locks and keys, manufactured by the Taquet brothers in Nantes. Each iron could restrain two slaves. The Diligent was setting off on its first slave-trading voyage. The Africans who would wear these irons were destined for the French West Indian island of Martinique. French development of this and other islands had lagged behind the English. In 1700 there were about 30,000 African slaves in the French colonies, compared with around a 100,000 in the English ones, and sugar exports were correspondingly smaller, but the first decades of the 18th century would see a rapid growth in French involvement in the slave trade and in the development of their colonies. The activities of the Billy brothers were part of a more general trend, as the usually dirigiste French crown gave a greater degree of freedom to merchants and entrepreneurs. The 1731 voyage was the Billy brothers' first involvement in the slave trade. It demanded a very significant investment: the cost of sending a ship on the African slave run was two or three times that of other branches of commerce. Outfitting the Diligent, including food, loading costs and two months' salary for the crew, came to 80,000 livres - more than four times the price of the ship itself, and this before insurance. The Billy brothers were expecting big profits from the sale of Africans they would never see. Robert Harms has based his riveting account of the 'worlds of the slave trade' on a journal kept by a young lieutenant on the Diligent, Robert Durand, a document sold in the 1980s to the Beinecke Library at Yale, where Harms teaches. Historians have uncovered records of more than seventeen thousand slaving voyages in the 18th century, but, as Harms points out, only a handful give us any insight into the daily life of the ship, the crew and its human cargo. Most are careful records of the ship's passage, prices, rates of exchange, slaves' vital statistics and deaths. As Robin Blackburn has argued, the slave trade and the slave plantation were run with an instrumental rationality, according to business principles that were ahead of their time, and produced an abundance of statistics. Durand's journal is one of the handful of records that provides more than this, but even so it is characterised as much by its silences as by its evocative descriptions and jaunty drawings. \"Curiously,\" Harms writes, \"Robert Durand mentioned the African captives only twice during the entire 66 days of the middle passage, and then only to record deaths.\" Harms uses the voyage of the Diligent to take us through the 'worlds' of the Atlantic slave trade in the early 18th century. There are three of them in this case: France, West Africa and Martinique, with a few offshore islands thrown in. Harms's argument is that these worlds are distinct, with their own histories and dynamics, but that during this period the slave trade was beginning to link their fates. Perhaps his most original contribution to the ever increasing scholarship on slavery, however, is his account of the French slave traders and the political and social context of early 18th-century French colonial commerce. The ships that sailed from Brittany had their backs turned to the impoverished rural economy of the hinterland. The big players in colonial trade were Nantes and later Lorient, and though government-chartered companies had previously exercised near complete monopolies, by this time the merchants of Nantes were proving successful advocates of private enterprise. The development of the French colonies may have been dirigiste in comparison to the English, but the French king could not afford to ignore an increasingly vociferous group of private merchants pressing for reform of the now discredited system of corporate mercantilism. Still, French colonial trade, as Harms makes clear, was relatively unintegrated into the larger economy, which was still predominantly agricultural. In the 18th century, commercial cities like Nantes were a bit like the 'free trade zones' of the 'Third World' today - disconnected from the rest of the country, importing and exporting goods that most people would never own, and perhaps never see. Arriving in Nantes, with its grand merchants' mansions and its opera house, the English traveller Arthur Young found himself in a strikingly different world from the one he had been journeying through: \"Mon Dieu! I cried to myself, do all the wastes, the deserts, the heath, ling, furz, broom and bog that I have passed for three hundred miles lead to this spectacle? What a miracle, that all this splendour and wealth of the cities of France should be so unconnected with the country!\" The Billy brothers, like many others, wanted their share of the source of this wealth. Guillaume and François were the younger generation of an upwardly mobile merchant family from the much smaller and sleepier neighbouring port of Vannes - a conventional market town belonging to an older world, a major exporter of grain, deeply embedded in the region's semi-feudal economy and society. Thanks to their father's success in the grain trade, the Billy brothers were wealthy, but not wealthy enough to manoeuvre themselves into the local nobility. A major crisis in grain, and the glittering example of Nantes, encouraged them to move into the exotic world of colonial trade. In 1728, after much lobbying, the King's Council granted the merchants of Vannes permission to participate (in a limited way) in trade with the West Indies. The brothers became minor investors in ships making the transatlantic crossing - transporting manufactured goods from France to the French West Indies and returning with cargoes of sugar and cotton. This was all very well, but no self-respecting entrepreneur could fail to notice that by adding another leg to these voyages, vastly greater profits could be made. Ships arriving in the West Indies from France could trade their load of manufactured cloth, brandy, wine and other goods for enough raw sugar to fill roughly a third of the hold. A load of African slaves, however, was worth nearly twice as much. Although the French were relative latecomers to the Atlantic slave trade, their involvement grew rapidly in the 1700s, making them the third largest participant (after Britain and Portugal) by the end of the century. As Harms points out, in France in the first half of the century there was barely any recognition that the conduct of the slave trade might be a moral issue, though this would change in the run-up to the revolution. So, when Harms asks rhetorically of Durand's opening sentence \"How could [he] outline such an evil mission in such impersonal prose?\" one suspects that he knows the answer. For investors like the Billy brothers the existence of the slaves was more virtual than real, but their decision to involve themselves more directly was nevertheless a big one: the risks were great, foremost among them disease and death, both of the human cargo and the crew. On average, slave traders in this period made returns of between 7 and 10 per cent annually - more or less in line with other branches of commerce. But the average clearly disguised huge variations, and huge expectations. The risks were high, but, if you were lucky, so were the profits. In late 1730, then, the Billy brothers bought the Diligent, a modest grain-ship, and set about refitting and equipping it for the triangular trade. They would soon learn that it was a specialised business: in order to buy slaves on the coast of West Africa they would have to make sure they could supply the right goods to the picky African elite on whom they depended. That it was a global business is demonstrated by the inventory of goods loaded into the hold, only a fraction of which were produced in France. More than 40% came from India and the Indian Ocean, and were purchased by the Billy brothers at the Company of Indies warehouse in Nantes. They included a bewildering variety of Indian cloth (fashions for which changed rapidly on the West African coast) and cowry shells, which served as currency on the slave coast. (So fundamental was the link between slaves, cowry shells and political authority that a Dahomian tradition held that when a king wanted cowry shells his henchmen would tie a rope around the neck of a slave and throw him into the ocean, where the shells would attach to his body like barnacles.) Equally crucial was the choice of a crew. They chose a captain with slaving experience, who then recruited the rest of the crew, from officers to accordion boy. This was Durand's first slaving trip, and the journal would provide evidence of his familiarity with the trade, a valuable addition to his curriculum vitae. Crews on slave ships were well paid in compensation for the risks: four of the Diligent's crew were to die in the course of this voyage. Harms is a historian of Africa, and the richest section of this book concerns the complex politics of the African slave trade on the continent itself. Two months after leaving Vannes, and three weeks after leaving the 'cultural halfway house' of the Canary Islands, the crew spot first the Grain Coast and then the Gold Coast. The Dutch fort of Elmina on the Gold Coast had originally been built in 1482 by the Portuguese, who had used it as the base for their gold-buying operations. Durand was impressed, and drew a childish picture of the fortifications, the 'pretty houses', and the Dutch flag flapping in the ocean breeze. In fact, 'Gold Coast' was already becoming a misnomer, since Dutch interest in the area was rapidly switching from gold to slaves. Inland, imported guns were fuelling the rise of the great Asante empire and a fierce struggle for control over trade routes. Warfare produced slaves, now more likely than ever to be sold for export. Things had not always been this way, as Harms reminds us: between 1475 and 1540 more than twelve thousand slaves from the Bight of Benin and Sao Tomé had been imported to the Gold Coast by the Portuguese to be purchased by wealthy Africans, who used them as gold-field workers and porters on merchant caravans. By the early 18th century, however, things had moved on. The sheer numbers involved in the Atlantic slave trade make this clear. In the course of the 16th century around 370,000 people were taken from Africa; in the next century this would rise to nearly two million, and in the 18th to more than six million. It has been estimated that in order to deliver the nine million slaves who arrived at the coast in the period from 1700 to 1850, around 21 million Africans were probably captured; five million of these would have died within a year of capture, and seven million remained in Africa as slaves. The population of certain regions of West and West Central Africa was significantly reduced. The Diligent sailed on from Elmina, past a succession of English, Dutch and Danish forts, towards its destination: the part of the coast beyond the delta of the Volta river known as the Slave Coast. French slaving operations centred on the tiny kingdom of Whydah, which extended along 40 miles of coastline and stretched 25 miles inland. Whydah was a trading kingdom, at that time exporting between 16 and 20 thousand slaves a year, among whom were representatives of some 30 ethnic groups. King Huffon presided over the trade from his capital city, Savi. All the major European trading companies were represented there - the English, the French, the Dutch and the Portuguese - and their compounds were built into the walls of the royal palace. At his coronation ceremony in 1725, Huffon was surrounded not only by his 40 elaborately dressed wives, but also by the representatives of all the trading companies, who were seated to his right on stuffed chairs. Huffon himself sat on a gilded throne decorated with the French coat of arms. The ostentatious wealth and sophistication of Huffon's kingdom drew admiring descriptions from amazed foreign visitors. The dense population was fed, in part, by an intensive agricultural system based on millet, but incorporating such New World crops as maize and sweet potatoes; within the city walls, a rich variety of both European and African goods could be purchased at a number of daily markets. But by the time of the Diligent's voyage, Whydah was in a state of war. As on the Gold Coast, trade rivalry had resulted in a new, militarised African politics. The cause of the problems in Whydah was the rise of the rival kingdom of Dahomey, some 50 miles inland. Whydah controlled access to the European trading companies and their goods, while Dahomey's King Agaja remained frustratedly dependent on his neighbour. Agaja had ambitions for what had been a small, peaceful kingdom. He built up a formidable professional army and armed his soldiers with imported flintlock muskets rather than the traditional longbows. His fascination with the arts of war was such that he later obtained for himself a French suit of armour which, according to one visitor, made him look like Don Quixote. He used psychology as part of his military strategy, with public sacrifices of captives helping to maintain a state of terror. In 1724, during a raid on the kingdom of Allada (which lay between Whydah and Dahomey), he had taken captive an English employee of the Royal African Company, Bulfinch Lambe. Agaja had never seen a European before, though he had heard all about them, and for the next two years, with the aid of an interpreter, he held long conversations with Lambe. Agaja was, apparently, fascinated by literacy, and even invented his own script. He wanted to know about the economics of the slave trade and, in particular, what accounted for the Europeans' insatiable appetite for slaves. Lambe explained that they were exported to be used on Caribbean plantations to produce wealth in the form of sugar. Agaja understood immediately, and announced that he would cease to be a mere exporter of slaves and would, instead, set up his own plantations. Lambe, seeing a way out of his captivity, persuaded Agaja that such a scheme should be executed in co-operation with King George I. Agaja dictated a personal letter to the English King and Lambe was released so that he could return to England to negotiate an agreement. In 1727, Agaja's army attacked Whydah, driving King Huffon and Captain Assou, the main ally of the French in Savi, into exile, and taking prisoners among the crew members guarding the slave ships in port. In 1731, a state of war still prevailed. Captain Assou, infuriated at his betrayal, attacked the Europeans' tents in an attempt to disrupt the trade, which was now in the hands of Agaja. Reluctantly, the captain of the Diligent weighed anchor, and left. When he arrived at the port of Jakin, there were 15 slave ships in the harbour, events at Whydah having driven everyone in this direction. While the crew set about making final alterations to the ship to prepare it for its cargo, Durand set up a large sail-cloth tent on the beach, from which he would conduct negotiations and make his purchases. With competition so fierce, prices were high and he had to bargain. He also had to be sure to obtain an optimum mix of men, women and children. He was buying slaves in exchange for cotton, firearms and other goods, whose relative values could vary wildly from Vannes to Jakin, making the calculation of profit a tricky business. Durand recorded every detail of his transactions - he knew that later he would have to account for it all. But, as Harms remarks, he gives no hint of how he felt about participating in this activity. Harms's careful historical reconstruction has provided us with a rich description of the worlds of the slave trade, but having reached Jakin we are reminded of its banality, which is simultaneously its tragedy. Gender, age and a supposed 'ethnicity' were recorded, the naked bodies examined for defects, and then branded. Finally, 256 slaves made the terrifying canoe ride across the surf to the waiting ship. Durand's silence on the subject of his human cargo frustrates Harms, who wants to know whether he felt a sadistic sense of power over these Africans, or whether perhaps he felt compassion. But such self-examination is not the purpose of Durand's journal, even assuming that he engaged in it. In fact he tells us little about the 'middle passage', and Harms uses a compilation of other sources to stop the gap. We gather that from the point of view of the slave trader, the faster this part of the journey was over the better: the quicker the crossing the lower the mortality rate, and the less the likelihood of a slave revolt. It may have been the slaves who were in chains but there was a degree of mutuality in the terror evoked. While Europeans dreamed of African cannibals, many enslaved Africans believed that they were destined to be eaten by their European captors - how else to explain the appetite for slaves that King Agaja had puzzled over? Such a fear could be so overwhelming as to lead them to suicide, or to acts of violence and insurrection against the terrified crew. Diseases spread, inevitably, from the slave deck to the crew quarters. In this atmosphere of terror and despair, Noël Magré, the ship's accordion player, would have been put to work. Slave traders knew very well that melancholy was the enemy of profit, since slaves who were prone to depression were also prone to lie down and die. It was the accordion player's job to 'cheer them up' with some jolly seafaring tunes, and to animate the enforced dancing that was part of the exercise regime. This section of Harms's account made me uncomfortable. His technique - the use of Durand's journal as a peg on which to hang a revealing narrative - is valid and effective, and he has scoured a multitude of archives to fill out Durand's account. The historian's task of reconstruction seems all the more pressing in the case of slavery, in the course of which so many lives and so many histories were lost. But another of the historian's responsibilities is to confront us with the absences. Toni Morrison has described her reluctance to represent the abjection of the middle passage: Beloved, she says, stands in for 'those black slaves whom we don't know . . . I had to be dragged, I suppose by them, kicking and screaming into this book, because it is just too much.' Perhaps, then, Harms is right to drag us reluctantly into his reconstruction of the Diligent's hold. But a historian is not a novelist, and arguably only a novelist (or a poet) can represent the unrepresentable trauma of the middle passage. By the time the Diligent reached the harbour of St Pierre on Martinique, nine slaves had died - a relatively low mortality rate for the time. The survivors were bathed, shaved and their skin rubbed with palm oil. Dealers boarded the ship to inspect the human merchandise. The captain named his price - 950 livres each - but no one was offering anywhere near that figure. Just as the war in Whydah had forced up the price of slaves, so recent events had depressed selling prices in Martinique. The opening of the trade to private traders had increased supply, and in addition, the economy of Martinique was in crisis, owing to a combination of the massive earthquake of 1727 and disputes between small planters and the Company of the Indies. The Diligent's captain held out for his price, but within a month the slaves began to die in the slave warehouse of St Pierre. He was forced to sell at less than half his original asking price. Most went to a dealer called Lamy, about whom we know little, except that he was an expert in this business and had calculated the timing of his offer carefully. The rest probably went to local officials and planters. This is the last we know of them. The Diligent returned to Brittany loaded with cotton, sugar and rocou, a plant substance used in the dyeing process. The long voyage had certainly produced a profit, but not the profit the Billy brothers had dreamed of. They sued the captain, alleging that he had been profligate with supplies and that he had twice switched one of his personally purchased slaves for another belonging to the outfitters. The holding of the trial may well account for the survival of Durand's journal - it was used in evidence. (The verdict, however, has not survived.) No such trace remains of the 242 surviving Africans who had been left on Martinique. Harms describes the enthusiasm with which he took himself off to the archives there in pursuit of the final part of his story. I've been there myself on a similar pursuit. The glistening new departmental archives sit on a hill overlooking Fort-de-France and the ocean. They are meticulously catalogued and the staff are ever helpful. But they yield nothing of the lives of the Africans who survived the experience of the Diligent: no names, no baptismal records, no marriages, no deaths. No trace. This is the end of the journey for both the historian and his readers. Megan Vaughan is Professor of Commonwealth Studies at the University of Oxford.

The Portuguese prime minister, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said Britain would not be able to take a lead on issues such as EU reform and defence policy if it stayed outside the single currency. Mr Durao Barroso is thought to be the first head of government to state so explicitly that Britain will suffer if it stays outside the eurozone. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"You can't be at the centre of it [Europe] if in the most important enterprise in Europe, you are not there. \"If the United Kingdom does not share with other partners the duties of membership in the euro, it can't have the right afterwards to lead in important matters like defence, where Britain traditionally has had a very important role, or in institutional debates.\" Portugal is today facing a general strike sparked by dissatisfaction at austerity measures imposed by the Portuguese government in order to stay within the terms of the EU's stability and growth pact. George Eustice, campaign director of the anti-euro No Campaign, said: \"When Portugal is having to make massive cuts in public services and defence spending under the rules of the stability pact, it is an odd time to lecture Britain about policy on the euro. \"If anything, Portugal is a classic example of why we are better off staying outside the euro and keeping control of our economy.\" The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, said: \"Britain can't expect to continue to have a leading voice in setting the rules if we're not taking part in the game. \"The opportunity to join the euro on favourable terms is clearly there. But, as we found in the past with agriculture and fisheries, that won't last forever. \"Britain's interests will increasingly be sidelined if we are not a member of the eurozone.\" Theresa Villiers MEP, the Conservative spokesman on economic affairs in the European parliament, said: \"Influence in the EU has nothing to do with signing up for the euro. It has always been recognised that different countries want different things from membership of the EU. \"There are many examples of projects involving some but not all member states - for example, the decision of the UK and Ireland to opt out of certain VAT rules by retaining zero rates on food and children's clothes. \"The best way to influence the agenda in the EU is to come up with good ideas and persuade other countries that they will yield benefits across the EU. The classic example of this was Mrs Thatcher's championing of the single market.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2002/dec/09/travelnews.internationalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-09T19:27:35Z","webTitle":"Africa opens door to vast animal kingdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/dec/09/travelnews.internationalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2002/dec/09/travelnews.internationalnews","fields":{"headline":"Africa opens door to vast animal kingdom","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of the world's biggest conservation areas will be created today when Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe open their borders to merge three game reserves into one. They will allow wildlife and people to roam across the 35,000 sq km - almost half the area of Scotland - of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park by building bridges and roads and removing fences and visa restrictions. The park's backers hope that what they call the biggest animal kingdom will lure tourists who might otherwise be deterred by southern Africa's record of famine, crime, poverty, disease and political turmoil. The park, intended to be big enough to foster biodiversity and sustain carnivores, will have a mammal population of more than 100,000. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe are due to join President Joaquim Chissano to sign a treaty near the Mozambican capital Maputo today, after two years of negotiations on sharing costs and benefits. Tourism and environment ministers are expected to pull down a fence on the South African side in a symbolic act of unity. More than 1,000 animals from South Africa, including dozens of elephants, have been carried to Mozambique to acquaint them with their new surroundings. The park will open to visitors next year. The amalgamation of South Africa's Kruger national park, Mozambique's Limpopo park and Zimbabwe's Gonarezhou national park has been endorsed by conservationists as a sensible pooling of resources. The political instability in Zimbabwe delayed and threatened to derail the scheme, but the negotiators eventually agreed how they should share hundreds of species, including elephants, rhinoceroses, lions, giraffes, antelope and more than 300 types of tree. The fear that tourists will shun the region because of its recent travails added a sense of urgency to the talks. Zimbabwe hopes that those put off by its crumbling economy and violent farm seizures will enter its territory - and spend foreign currency - through its more peaceful neighbours. Mozambique, which has had difficulty attracting tourists because Portuguese colonial rule and a civil war killed much of its wildlife and left its infrastructure in ruins, hopes to gain roads and bridges as well as South African animals. A bridge across the Limpopo river at Pafuri is one of the new structures needed to let visitors roam across national borders without leaving the park. South Africa, which has experienced a spate of robberies from and murders and rapes of tourists near the Kruger park, is anxious for some positive publicity. There is talk of a new airport nearby with direct flights to Europe. The South African environment and tourist ministry hailed the project as an example of regional cooperation and sustainable development. Its statement said: \"The park will open to the world the biggest ever animal kingdom, increasing foreign investment into the region and creating much-needed jobs for our people, further acting as a symbol of peace and unity for the African people.\" The Great Limpopo park follows the example of three smaller transfrontier parks created by South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Lesotho. Communities affected are reported to have backed the project after assurances of compensation. Today's signing ceremony marks the end of the political negotiations and the beginning of work by a joint management board on security, conservation, tourism and personnel. The Kruger national park, which stretches 220 miles along the Mozambique border, has the reputation of being one of the most unspoilt of savanna landscapes, a place where visitors can drive for hours without seeing another human. Many baboons, zebras, water bucks, vervet monkeys and impalas have become so used to vehicles that they ignore them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2002/dec/09/northkorea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-09T12:50:56Z","webTitle":"Still out in the cold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/09/northkorea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/dec/09/northkorea","fields":{"headline":"Still out in the cold","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, better known simply as North Korea, is neither democratic nor a republic. And it certainly does not belong to its 23 million people. The country is run by a dictator, Kim Jong-Il, son of its founder president, Kim Il-Sung, and a small, secretive clique of army and party officials. The regime espouses, in theory, a communist or socialist ideology, and despite recent attempts at reform, directs a command economy and centralised social and institutional structures in which all citizens and resources are at the disposal of the state. The tide of change that brought quiet or violent revolutions to most communist-run countries after the end of the cold war has passed North Korea by. Personal rights and freedoms of the kind enshrined in the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights do not exist there. Once described as the \"hermit kingdom\", there are no free elections, no free speech, no freedom of association or travel, and no free press. Like dictatorships elsewhere, the Pyongyang regime relies on brutal repression to maintain control. Human rights groups have estimated that up to 200,000 people are incarcerated in prison camps. Arbitrary execution, torture and forced labour are routinely used to maintain the regime's authority. International agencies such as the Red Cross and the UN Human Rights Commission have been denied unfettered access. Official propaganda promotes a personality cult around the short, portly figure of Kim Jong-Il. The \"Dear Leader\" has a penchant for too-tight, Elvis-style jump-suits and, according to a new book by a former Russian diplomat, for lobster and other gourmet delicacies, vintage Bordeaux and dancing girls or \"lady conductors\". Kim's grotesquely self-indulgent lifestyle contrasts harshly with the food shortages and other hardships that affect most North Koreans. This year has seen a growing exodus of refugees and asylum seekers across the border to China. Famine caused by mismanagement of state-controlled agriculture, and exacerbated by floods and drought, caused the deaths of several million North Koreans in the 1990s, according to aid agency estimates. The country has never really recovered, in part because its ability to recuperate was seriously hindered by the growing diplomatic and economic estrangement from its former cold war patrons in Moscow and Beijing. Last week, the UN's World Food Programme said it expected to have to feed more than a quarter of North Korea's population next year, following projections of a renewed famine. It appealed for $200m in extra funding and has already been forced to reduce its per capita rations. However, this latest appeal comes on top of the much larger, developing famine emergencies in southern Africa and Ethiopia, and the continuing international effort in Afghanistan. Donor countries, dismayed by the North Korea regime's self-destructive policies, may prove reluctant to do more for a country that appears incapable of helping itself. The humanitarian aspect apart, North Korean misery and misrule might be considered of little importance for the world at large. There are, after, all many countries where misgovernance and misfortune combine with dreadful results for the inhabitants. But Kim Jong-Il, eccentric and irresponsible though he may be, is not entirely foolish. Like his father, he knows how to get the west's attention. And as the country's situation has grown more desperate over the years, he has used a number of levers to gain the west's help. One lever is friction with South Korea, the vastly more successful state from which the North was separated along the 38th parallel after Japan's surrender in 1945. Kim maintains a large army, and memories of the Korean war, which ended with an uneasy armistice in 1953, are never allowed to fade completely. North Korea has regularly provoked armed skirmishes with the South, the most recent of which was a naval clash last summer which resulted in several dozen deaths. At the same time, Kim - who in theory is committed to reunification - has given a guarded welcome to the \"sunshine policy\" of détente pursued by South Korea's President Kim Dae-Jung. This process reached a high point in 2000 with a summit meeting in Pyongyang. There have been further moves this year to improve cross-border links, promote trade and reduce military tensions. But Kim has never kept his promise to pay a return visit to Seoul. He apparently prefers to keep the South guessing about his real intentions with the aim of extracting more concessions and direct aid. Significantly, with Kim Dae-Jung retiring, the conservative favourite in this month's South Korean election to replace him, Lee Hoi-Chang, has threatened to cut cash aid to Pyongyang unless it modifies its behaviour in a range of areas. North Korea has exercised similar tactics in its relations with Japan, the former colonial power and now the region's economic superpower. Pyongyang is dependent on direct Japanese aid, too. But that did not stop it severely rattling Tokyo in 1998 by test-firing a ballistic missile over the sea of Japan. That intensified long-standing fears about North Korea's missile programmes and its collaboration with other states, notably Pakistan, in selling and buying related technology. Like Seoul, Japan's leaders never quite know what to make of Kim, but their instinct is in favour of broadening contacts rather than a dangerous confrontation. Thus while it was a gamble, it was not a total surprise that Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, went to Pyongyang last September to meet Kim in person. His purpose was in part to encourage the very limited free market reforms introduced by Kim earlier this year, and boost détente. Koizumi offered a generous aid package if bilateral relations were normalised. But he also got a shock, typical of Kim: North Korea admitted for the first time to abducting Japanese citizens in cold war covert operations. The subsequent angry outcry in Japan has further confused the Tokyo government about how best to handle its unpredictable neighbour. Kim has tried to play the same game with the US and almost succeeded, towards the end of the second Clinton administration, in winning more concessions when the then secretary of state Madeleine Albright was induced to visit Pyongyang. But in the Bush administration he has encountered a far less malleable sparring partner. Under President George Bush, North Korea has become a declared adversary. Bush and his top advisers disagreed over North Korea policy after coming to office, wavering between negotiation and confrontation. But September 11 changed all that. The primary reason is North Korea's continuing efforts, as the US sees it, to acquire nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction that could threaten US bases in South Korea, US allies such as Japan, and even the US mainland itself. For this reason, Bush included Pyongyang in his \"axis of evil\". For this reason, the US has also pressured Russia and China to exert what influence they still have on North Korea. The two countries obliged last week, issuing a joint statement urging North Korea to honour a 1994 agreement to eschew the pursuit of nuclear weapons. Bush's demonisation of North Korea's regime after September 11 was based on several factors, only one of which was its military activities. It suited Washington to highlight the link between repressive regimes or \"failed\" or \"rogue\" states like North Korea and international terrorism and weapons proliferation. It served to rally Asian countries to the US banner in the \"global war on terror\". The threat posed by countries such as North Korea, constantly stressed and embroidered on in Washington, also helped Bush's Republican party in November's mid-term elections, and may well help Bush's re-election bid in 2004. The Pentagon says, for example, that Pyongyang already has several nuclear warheads. There is no firm evidence for that claim. But Bush has another reason for singling out North Korea. As with Osama bin Laden, as with Saddam Hussein, he has personalised the issue. He recently told the author and reporter Bob Woodward of his \"hate\" for Kim and all he stands for. For Bush, Kim personifies the enemy in the great 21st century global battle between good and evil, between right and wrong, that Bush has vowed to lead and win. North Korea's recent, surprise admission that it has continued to pursue nuclear capability despite the 1994 accord has only served to entrench Bush's view. Washington's reaction has been to lobby regional allies further to isolate Pyongyang. One recent result was a decision to cut off fuel oil supplies to North Korea. This is probably just the beginning of a war of attrition. It seems likely that Kim, shielded from the world and distracted by his dancing girls and four-hour banquets, has failed so far to appreciate that his old game of making threats and conjuring spectres in order to win concessions will not wash with the Bush administration. Most probably, he believes his nuclear \"confession\" will persuade the west to engage with him on his terms and try to buy him off with more assistance and aid. If so, this is a potentially regime-changing miscalculation. Until Iraq is sorted out, one way or another, the US is unlikely to move against North Korea in any concerted way. But once its hands are free of Saddam, America's attention may turn to North Korea in ways that Kim could find terminally uncomfortable. That in turn presents a deeply disturbing and dangerous prospect for South Korea, Japan, and others who may be within striking distance of Pyongyang's zany \"Dear Leader\". · Simon Tisdall is the Guardian's foreign affairs leader writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2002/dec/06/newmedia.internationalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-06T07:55:19Z","webTitle":"Good news text service gives rainbow nation a silver lining","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/06/newmedia.internationalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2002/dec/06/newmedia.internationalnews","fields":{"headline":"Good news text service gives rainbow nation a silver lining","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Forget the murders, rapes, poverty and disease, here is some happy news: Walt Disney serves only South African wine at its Animal Kingdom Lodge in the US.

It also spread the word that the international data analyst Standard &amp; Poor's has upgraded its economic outlook for South Africa, and that the UN has praised the country's crime prevention strategy. The news service was launched at the same time as a new coffee-table book, South Africa, the Good News, which features uplifting views from 50 contributors. The education minister, Kader Asmal, endorsed the book and said the impression of a crime-ridden country came from flawed statistics. However, according to a global attitudes survey published this week, the rainbow nation's gloom is deepening. The Washington-based Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press said 79% of South Africans were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country, 96% considered crime a very big problem, and just over half thought President Thabo Mbeki was a bad influence.

The resignations come as Qorvis Communications becomes embroiled in a massive row that is flaring up between Saudi and the US over the funding of terrorism and other issues. Qorvis has been paid about £127,000 a month to help the kingdom bolster its battered image. The most prominent of the departing executives is Judy Smith, a former White House deputy press secretary. Ms Smith became a household name in the US as the spokeswoman for Monica Lewinsky during Bill Clinton's impeachment, and later as a spokeswoman for the family of Chandra Levy, the murdered Washington intern. She and the other departing partners, two longtime Republican Party strategists Bernie Merritt and Jim Weber, announced they were leaving to join Clark &amp; Weinstock, a New York public relations firm. Associates of the three said the departures reflected a deep discomfort in representing the government of Saudi Arabia against accusations that Saudi leaders have turned a blind eye to terrorism, according to a report in the New York Times today. But the managing partner of Qorvis, Michael J. Petruzzello, told the New York Times he did not believe the firm's representation of Saudi Arabia had anything to do with the departures. The flare-up between the US and Saudi began with allegations that thousands of dollars in charitable gifts from princess Haifa bint Faisal - wife of the Saudi's Washington ambassador - had found their way to friends of two of the September 11 hijackers. Although there is no evidence that the princess knew where the money had gone, Riyadh views the affair as part of a campaign led by US conservatives to implicate prominent Saudis in the financing of al-Qaida. And a White House committee is seeking to subpoena Qorvis Communications, and two other firms contracted to the Saudi government, for documents regarding a congressional investigation into child abductions. The investigation is looking into children with US citizenship who have been taken to Saudi Arabia against their will. A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington had no immediate comment on the departures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2002/dec/05/chechnya.nickpatonwalsh","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-05T01:47:40Z","webTitle":"Chechen rebels phoned Gulf during siege","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/05/chechnya.nickpatonwalsh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/dec/05/chechnya.nickpatonwalsh","fields":{"headline":"Chechen rebels phoned Gulf during siege","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian security officials suspect that the Chechens who seized a Moscow theatre in October had wealthy Arab sponsors in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states and have sought Washington's support in finding the financiers. Senior officials say they have traced a series of telephone calls from the gunmen to their \"sponsors\" in the Gulf. During one call made to an unspecified Gulf state a financier asked for a video of scenes inside the theatre, and was told it could be made for a $1m fee. \"Several long telephone conversations were intercepted to Saudi Arabia, to the Emirates, and to Qatar. \"We can say for sure that the hostage-taking was financed from abroad, and the terrorists maintained permanent contact with their sponsors.\" He added that the leader of the hostage-takers, Mosvar Barayev, and several of his fellow Chechens had planned to flee to the Gulf once the crisis was over. The Chechen rebels seized the theatre on October 23. After a long siege by Russian troops, 129 hostages and 50 gunmen were killed. The source declined to name the sponsors and the country from which the video was requested, because the general prosecutor's office is still investigating the event. The revelation helps to explain the pointed comments President Vladimir Putin made after his recent meeting with George Bush in St Petersburg. He pointed out that 16 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were Saudi citizens, saying: \"We will remember this,\" and adding:\"We should not forget those who provide financing to terrorists.\" Russian security officials have been issuing warnings about the threat posed by Islamist extremists funded by wealthy Gulf state benefactors since the mid-90s. The security source said: \"According to [security service] estimates, each month from the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, from £1.3m to £2.5m comes to support terrorism on the territory of the Russian Federation.\" The Russian security services were constantly exchanging information on the funding organisations with their American and British counterparts, he said. Sources in Washington and Moscow confirmed that there was cooperation. A senior US state department official said that all Russia's concerns about links between the theatre siege and financiers in Gulf, and its fears about the \"Saudi connection to international terrorism\" would be \"evaluated\" by the commission on September 11 led by the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. The official said Washington had offered Russia help in its investigation of the theatre incident, but would not give details. He added: \"The Saudis have said they will look more closely at some charity organisations and we cannot help but believe that this is a direct response to [our] concerns. \"But we are not singling anyone out and are looking at all avenues.\" The official would not confirm a report that the state department was considering adding groups linked to Chechen separatists to the treasury blacklist of terrorism financiers, but said they were \"constantly evaluating groups\". Russian security officials say there are long-standing links between organisations in Saudi Arabia and \"terrorist activity\" in Russia. The official added: \"In Saudi Arabia there is a group of NGOs linked to al-Qaida that form an integral system feeding terrorism. \"We count about 20 such organisations there who have accounts and branches in other countries.\" He added that the NGOs' purported purpose, international support for Muslims, was a front for funding terrorism. \"We are cooperating with the Saudi Arabian special services, and several Saudi delegations have come to Moscow to discuss this.\" But Saudi officials are currently busy denying that their country has become a haven for financiers of terrorism. On Monday the Saudi embassy in Washington released a report describing a series of measures the kingdom had taken since September 11 against terrorist financiers. Adel al-Jubeir, a key aide to Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, conceded that some of the hundreds of millions of dollars sent abroad by Saudi charities each year might have gone to al-Qaida . He added: \"We cannot allow our money to be used to murder people.\" He insisted that Saudi investigations had led to charity accounts being audited, 2,000 people being questioned and 100 jailed, and 33 accounts, worth £3.5m, being frozen. He said accusations of terrorism sponsorship had generated unprecedented \"anti-Saudi sentiment\" in America."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2002/dec/04/education.studentpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-04T14:38:01Z","webTitle":"Thousands join fees demonstration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/dec/04/education.studentpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2002/dec/04/education.studentpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Thousands join fees demonstration","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"\"We're drenched, cold, it's noisy and we've had a 12-hour journey, but we're still glad we're here,\" said Halla Mohieddeen, president of the student union at Heriot Watt university in Edinburgh, who was in London today to protest against top-up fees. Approximately 20,000 students braved the constant drizzle to make their point, student leaders said. The police said the number was more like 5,000. Ms Mohieddeen graduated last year with £12,500 debts. \"Right now that debt makes it pretty difficult to get by, but in the fourth year, when I couldn't physically take on a job because of my course workload, that was a really stressful time. It had quite a big impact on my studies because I was stressed. I also have arthritis, which was aggravated by stress, so the whole experience was very hard,\" she said. Leading the march, organised by the National Union of Students, was its president, Mandy Telford. \"This is everything we hoped for on a cold winter's day. Spirits are high. We've got a 40-piece marching band, puppets and singing - it's brilliant.\" But while the singing and chanting goes on, Ms Telford had a serious message for students once they arrived in Kennington Park for a rally. She told the faithful they had a fight on their hands, \"that top-up fees will happen unless we fight them\". \"This march encompasses more than top-up fees, they are what students are angry about now, but if the government decides against them, we'll keep campaigning for what we want - an end to student hardship.\" Rami Okasha, president of the NUS in Scotland, said the march was not about political point scoring. Two hundred Scottish students travelled on six buses through the night, from as far away as Aberdeen and the Isle of Skye, to be at the march. \"We're marching in solidarity for English students. Westminster has some regulatory powers that affect us - for example top-up fees would affect English students studying in Scotland. We want the government to rule out top-up fees and return grants to students across the United Kingdom. The system for Scottish students is much better because they don't have to pay fees upfront and are entitled to get a grant if they are poor,\" he said. Despite this, Scottish students are, on average, £15,000 in debt when they graduate - £3,000 more than English students, because north of the border, a standard degree lasts four years. Richard Raw, travelled nearly 700 miles from the Isle of Skye for today's march. He said the 24-hour trip was \"well worth it\". \"What goes on in the rest of the country in terms of education has an effect in places like Scotland. A lot of students in Scotland have the same attitude and are totally in favour of this action,\" he said. Ed Sargent, a second-year student at Bath University, put his reasons for taking part in the march most simply. \"I'm here because I am in financial poo,\" he said. He went on: \"My financial problems are not my fault. It's because my family can't support me to the extent that the government think they should. I was in trouble with the bank last term to the point where I was literally struggling to eat. I had no money whatsoever for days on end. The government want us to get a university education, and they won't support us through it. How can we pay it now? We might earn £400,000 more in our lifetimes, but without the education we won't. It's a circle that doesn't join up.\" Back at Downing Street, where officials from the Department for Education and Skills and the Treasury are thrashing out the future policy on student, ahead of a January announcement, Tony Blair's official spokesman said: \"Students are perfectly within their democratic rights to protest and make their voice heard. \"But I would point out we have yet to see the white paper, which will be published in January. Our plans are all about promoting access, particularly to students from lower paid families. A fair deal for students and their families. \"But also we do have to make sure that in an increasingly globalised educational marketplace our universities have got the funding they need to compete with the best, and that they have the teaching and research base that rivals their international partners. \"We can't allow a situation to develop where our universities lose their brightest and best, and as a result the quality of teaching in this country declines, and research declines, with all the obvious consequences of that. \"Were we not to grasp this particular nettle of under-funding, people would rightly protest that we were letting down future generations of students and also harming the long-term economic interests of this country.\" Margaret Hodge, minister for higher education, acknowledged that views were divided within the government on how to solve the funding conundrum. \"There is Cabinet discussion - as there is within the Parliamentary Labour Party, as there is with students, as there is within the higher education sector - of the very difficult options that we need to consider,\" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. \"We need to fund our universities properly. We need to ensure that we maintain research excellence. We want to expand numbers. \"We want to ensure that more people from lower income backgrounds go to university. We have got to square that circle.\" However, Phil Willis, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, today called top-up fees the Labour government's poll tax. \"I hope today's march will show the government that the extent of public feeling against top-up fees matches that felt against the poll tax,\" he said. \"Students must fight not only for their rights, but for those of the generations to come after them. What a shame that members of a Labour government are simply seeking to pull the ladder up after them,\" he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2002/dec/03/germany.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-03T02:39:21Z","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele: Germany's cast iron chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/03/germany.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/dec/03/germany.comment","fields":{"headline":"Germany's cast iron chancellor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pity Germany. Usually caricatured as a country with militarist instincts, for the last few months it has been in the dock on a different charge. The Bush administration accuses it of pacifism. Ever since its chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, announced during his re-election campaign in August that he would not take part in any \"adventure\" in Iraq, Washington's propaganda machine has been in high gear. Spinners put out the word that its irresponsibility may have lost Germany any chance of getting a permanent seat on the UN security council. Schröder's government was cold-shouldered by senior US officials. The Americans initially hoped Schröder's outburst was merely a ploy to get votes which a cynical chancellor would renounce under the pressure of American wrath once he was safely back in the saddle. But there has been no retreat. Schröder has gone on with his criticisms of US policy and at the recent Nato summit in Prague the Americans tried to corner him by making a big media issue out of whether superpower Bush would even shake the naughty boy's hand. Far from being isolated, Schröder was the man who with French help led the resistance to Washington's plans for Nato. The alphabetical seating plan put the United Kingdom and the United States side by side at Prague, but Schröder and Chirac sat symbolically next to each other opposite Blair and Bush. Together they toned down the Anglo-American draft for a Nato statement on Iraq, preventing any mention of \"readiness\" for military action and turning it into nothing more than a repetition of support for the UN. Schröder could not block the US from using long-standing American bases in Germany or deny it overflying rights for a war on Iraq. These are guaranteed by treaty and in the election campaign the chancellor never said he would reverse this. So his promise in Prague not to interfere with American freedom of movement, which he spelled out formally last week, was not a u-turn. His refusal to let Germany itself take part in a war remains firm. The new iron in the chancellor's spine comes in part from the even stronger stand of his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer. But Schröder now gives all the signs of being a man who is arming himself with a battery of arguments for a long struggle with Washington. In a jovial self-assured performance at his Prague press conference he talked of \"Europeanising\" decision-making on international issues and brushed aside American pressure on the EU to give Turkey a guarantee of future membership. If done, he said, it would be because it was in Europe's interest to encourage secular forces there. Washington's position was not part of the equation. He talked of \"asymmetrical\" warfare, now that powerful states have been shown to be vulnerable to low-tech terrorism. It was wrong to put the new threats into the framework of Nato's old machinery. On the contrary, the alliance had to come up with a sophisticated threat assessment and then develop a range of counter-measures, including more aid for development and poverty reduction, rather than simply rely on new hardware. Military means were only one element in what needed to be a broader and more imaginative package. Although Schröder denied seeing America's sudden new plans for a 21,000-person Nato reaction force as a measure aimed at undercutting the EU's slow effort to have its own such force, Schröder's actions show he shares French suspicions. His conditions for German participation effectively sabotage the US plan. Any decision to use the new Nato force would have to be unanimous, and no German troops could take part without a parliamentary vote. Schröder's decision to turn US foreign policy into a domestic election issue certainly had an element of expediency. The Social Democrats' private polls in August foretold defeat as clearly as the public ones. Yet what was important about the chancellor's move was that it succeeded. It revealed powerful underlying support for more independence in German foreign policy. Sustained by strong pro-Americanism for the last two generations, Germans were waiting for leaders to recognise the world was different. They want \"nationalism with a European face\"; in other words for Germany to defy the US when necessary and bring its European partners to take a similar stance. Having tested this new political chord in the election, Schröder continues to develop it. Chirac sees military prowess as a key element in his country's international reputation and has notions of great-power status which Germany does not share. But this divergence matters less than unity on the bigger issue. They are forcing the US into accepting that Nato will never take aggressive military action as an alliance. Bush can only count on \"coalitions of the willing\". Thanks to Schröder and Fischer there is also a \"coalition of the unwilling\". j.steele@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2002/dec/02/iraq.brianwhitaker","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-02T16:52:33Z","webTitle":"Qatar exercise signals US plan for Iraq battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/02/iraq.brianwhitaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/dec/02/iraq.brianwhitaker","fields":{"headline":"Qatar exercise signals US plan for Iraq battle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a thinly-veiled rehearsal for war in Iraq, the United States is preparing an unprecedented military exercise in Qatar to test its command structure. The exercise, codenamed Internal Look, is the strongest signal yet that the US intends to wage a possible war from the Gulf state famous for its maverick TV station, al-Jazeera. The exercise, due to start in about a week, will be the first war game of its kind conducted outside the US, according to the New York Times, which reported details yesterday. \"The command and control procedures practised would be the same used for a war with Iraq,\" the paper said. The US has focused its attention on Qatar because of Saudi Arabia's reluctance to let it use existing and highly sophisticated facilities in the kingdom. Over the last few years, Qatar has shown more sympathy towards Iraq than most other Gulf states and its controversial al-Jazeera channel - established in 1996 with funding from the emir - has excellent contacts in al-Qaida. But the emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, also enjoys close relations with the United States which was the first country to recognise his authority when he took power in a bloodless coup against his father seven years ago. US officials deny that they have formally asked the emir for permission to launch a war from his country, although they appear confident that permission would be granted if necessary. Qatar is 700 miles from Baghdad and its al-Udeid air base has the Gulf's longest runway and hangars for 100 aircraft. Currently it is home to the US army's 319th Air Expeditionary Group, fighter-bombers, reconnaissance planes and tankers, with enough equipment on site for one brigade and support units. This month's exercise will be run from another base in Qatar, as-Sayliyah, which was completed two years ago at a cost of more than $100m (£64m). It has more than 20 climate-controlled warehouses capable of storing enough armoured equipment for a heavy army brigade, including hundreds of tanks. In what is known as a command post exercise, US commanders will simulate a campaign against an enemy in the region, though no troops will be deployed. General Tommy Franks, head of Central Command, is expected to arrive in about a week, along with some 750 staff from his headquarters, the paper said. He will command his forces from the new Qatar headquarters while liaising with Marine commanders in Bahrain, the army commander in Kuwait and the air force commander at the Prince Sultan Air Base near Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. The exercise will coincide with the December 8 deadline for Iraq to provide details of its weaponry under Security Council resolution 1441 but, according to the paper, the commanders intend to leave the Gulf by mid-December unless tensions with Iraq escalate in the meantime. Once the command system has been tested they will be able to return at any time. \"All we have to do is hop on a plane and come forward,\" an unnamed military official told the paper. The US first used al-Udeid base in Qatar in September last year during the run-up to the war in Afghanistan - though its existence was still secret at the time. The emir made it public last March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2002/dec/02/europeanfootball.sport2","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-02T11:00:34Z","webTitle":"Barcelona break down again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/dec/02/europeanfootball.sport2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2002/dec/02/europeanfootball.sport2","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona break down again","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Something is rotten in the kingdom of Barcelona. And it's not the infamous, and week old, pig's head - even if Marca and As have spent the derbi aftermath puntastically making a meal of it with a string of special reports. Reports like Marca's \"exclusive\" interview with chef Cándido, the \"King of the cochinillo [suckling pig]\". Throwing the pig at Luis Figo was, Cándido claimed this week, \"an insult ... to the pig\". \"Cochinillo is an exquisite dish and a symbol of Segovia - it doesn't deserve to be treated this way\", Cándido grinned, adding: \" You need to be seriously twisted to bring that into the ground; the head would have made a right mess because of the liquid leaking out of it and it must have smelt repugnant\". Well, quite. But the Lord of the Flies isn't the only thing that stinks in Catalunya - so do FC Barcelona. Don't be fooled by the perfect Champions League record: Barça really reek. That's the inescapable conclusion after the week's embarrassing derbi fall-out was last night followed by a 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad that leaves Barça tenth, just six points clear of the relegation zone - their worst start for 31 years. And, there's no sign of things getting any better either - especially if, as expected, the Spanish Football Federation impose a Camp Nou closure in punishment at last week's derbi debacle. Losing to la Real is no disgrace, of course. Raynald Denoueix's side top the table by three points - and deservedly so. But, not for the first time, Barcelona didn't just lose. They were slaughtered. Had it not been for keeper Roberto Bonano, Real Sociedad could have had eight or nine. And, as if the performance wasn't bad enough, there was the added shame of late red cards for Thiago Motta and Marc Overmars; Motta got his for asking referee Pino Zamorano \"to go and take it up the arse\", while Overmars was sent off for \"pulling faces\". Not for the first time, As seized the chance to laugh at Barcelona. And flog a dead horse. It was, according to their automobile-obsessed match reporter Fabián Ortiz, a total mismatch: \"La Real run on Super, Barça on diesel\" he said, whipping up the bonnet, stroking his chin and shaking his head. \"Real hit the accelerator, reached top speed and stayed there until the end. They flew round the bends, their engine roaring nicely, their fans enjoying the ride. But when Barça put their foot on the pedal nothing happens - the exhaust just makes farting noises. If the road is up-hill, Barça slide backwards because their tyres are worn\". Nor is the motoring madness over: \"When Kluivert scored, Real just called in the mechanic Kovacevic who grabbed his tools and fixed the problem with two goals, sending Van Gaal back to check out his Highway code\". If the puns were bad - and they were - the performance was worse. \"Where are you going Barça?\" read Sport's front-page headline; a question it answered inside with more motoring metaphors - \"the road to nowhere\". Meanwhile, Patrik Kluivert's post-match response said it all. Interviewed by TVE's limelight hogging, bald pate-glistening grinning wally Quique Guash, Kluivert could barely muster up a sentence, finally mumbling: \"I don't know what's wrong with us\". Pretty much everything, really. Barça don't have a discernible first eleven, Luis Enrique is out injured, most of the fans never wanted Louis Van Gaal back in the first place, and the club is wracked by internal divisions, hidden agendas and economic difficulties which the president Joan Gaspart only seems to be making worse. The knives are out for Gaspart. His three-year presidency has reaped three managers, endless crises and no trophies - not even the Copa de Catalunya. And what little credit he had left was definitively lost with his ridiculous response to last week's derbi events; a response that even drew criticism from the vice-president of the government, Mariano Rajoy. As Radio commentator Gaspar Rosety put it this week, \"Gaspart is a poor, boring clown, out of fashion in a circus that needs better performers\". But if Gaspart's not exactly well liked, Louis Van Gaal - the man whose Spitting Image puppet is, tellingly, a barking stack of bricks with a mop of hair - is the only man in Catalunya less popular. That said, the standard image of Van Gaal is rather unfair, based as it is on his mangled Spanish and his \"libreta\" - his little tactics book. After all, there's nothing wrong with studying the game and Van Gaal's Spanish is not as bad as is made out. It is fundamentally correct - it's just that his accent is so hideously aggressive that if he told you he loved you, it would still sound like he was announcing plans to eat your entire family. And brutally batter his players. Rather like Rayo's horsey president Toothy Teresa Rivero, in fact: she witnessed her side drop into the relegation zone yesterday with a 3-1 defeat at struggling Espanyol and wasn't slow to bare those vicious teeth of hers: \"I feel like whacking our players with a stick\", she whinnied. \"This is a disgrace and I don't know if Fernando Vázquez will remain as our manager. Third division sides are better than us. If we couldn't win today against Espanyol, when are we going to win?\" Well, maybe next week, Toothy T. For next week, Rayo's visitors are FC Barcelona.

Excuse Pod while he yawns. Fair play to Steve Waugh's boys, it was a top effort to bounce back from getting stuffed at rugby and not having any culture as such. Plus Australia has to get by without any world-class historical figures such as Princess Diana or Islamabad Kingdom Brunel, though they do have a caravan site up on the north coast called Darwin, apparently. Let's face it, if Doug Walters so much as puts out a fag by dropping it in a beer can, an hour later it's being put in a vintage car and driven round the ground while the crowd breaks down in tears. So you don't have to be Carol Vorderman (Dave Podmore's personal No1 in the Great Briton stakes) to see that what lies behind the Aussies' thirst for success is a massive inferiority complex. To some extent, this is justified. The range of pre-heated meals available in some of their service stations is medieval - fillet of dugong in a bun, I ask you. Pull into a lay-by for a jimmy riddle and you're attacked by indigenous species so deadly you could be in a Tesco's fruit aisle. And you'd have to say that mediawise the wide, brown land's cupboard is worryingly bare. The only thing their news-papers are any good for is shoving down your trousers when you've got a coaching session with Peter Roebuck. But even that doesn't explain the sheer ugly Ocker triumphalism that goes with winning the Ashes. Against a side who, let's not forget, has struggled to find its feet, or even just to stand on them for more than a few minutes at a time. The moment Tudes was laid out and in need of the Fremantle Flying Doctor we knew it was time to pack up and let the Aussies have their little moment of glory. If we'd thought it was that important we could have gutsed it out for another two days, even though Chris Silverwood's crutches had been kicked to pieces by Nass. It seems Craig White had a go at them as well, but kept missing by a country mile. Dave Podmore is certainly not in the business of knocking our lads. You're bound to struggle a bit when you're a long way from your family and your dogs, in a strange country where most people's idea of conversation is to challenge you to name the registration numbers of all Don Bradman's cars from 1930 on wards (this is a guy who never had the self-respect to shell out for a personalised - how sad is that?). But it's fair to say we haven't had the rub of the green resultwise. If I do have a word of criticism it's not that we left these shores with a party of crocks that should have stopped off at Lourdes first, but that we could have done ourselves a lot more favours in the sledging arena. All you've got to do is get one of the close fielders to murmur \"That Bill Woodfull/Stan McCabe was a fine batsman and a fine man, too\" - then watch while their batter's little eyes fill with tears of nostalgia. I reckon you've got a good two or three overs to get a straight one in before they recover their composure. Pod senses that beneath the understandable childish delight in beating your elders and betters there is an Aussie awareness that payback time is fast approaching. We haven't sent for Hicky yet. Anyway, come Christmas what will the press be full of? Hayden's hundreds? Warney's 5,000 wickets? Of course not. It'll be the photos of the England boys once again romping away with the spoils in the Christmas fancy-dress contest. So here's a tip for Mark Waugh - if you want to compensate for your missing win bonus (and I understand sales of the book haven't been too clever either, mate) get your betting boots on and put your money on Robert Key. The theme of this year's contest is Celebrity Big Brother and I hear the lad's going on a strict Herb Adams meat-pie regime so he can do himself justice as Anne Diamond. Mark Pod's words. Come World Cup time the England boys will be off to Zimbabwe with our heads held high and nothing to prove. So if it makes them happy why don't we just let the Aussies have the bloody urn. Make it big enough and they can have some of our asylum seekers, too. Dave Podmore was talking to Christopher Douglas and Andrew Nickolds. The Word of Pod is supposedly in all good bookshops."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theobserver/2002/dec/01/features.review97","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-01T23:03:31Z","webTitle":"Dance: There's life in the old legs yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/dec/01/features.review97","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2002/dec/01/features.review97","fields":{"headline":"There's life in the old legs yet","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Kontakthof Barbican, London EC2 Nutcracker! Sadler's Wells, London EC1 Come the Christmas season, dance companies regret their limited age range: festive ballets, like pantos, require children and oldies. There's nothing more embarrassing than grown dancers frolicking in short pants and party frocks or youngsters affecting wrinkles and an arthritic stoop. Pina Bausch has gone for the real thing in a revision of her 1978 Kontakthof, now performed by the (mainly) over-65s. Though not intended as a Christmas show, its enforced conviviality is timely: these are people brought together to stave off loneliness. They meet in a bleak community centre that serves as a dance hall or cinema. They parade their attractions and inadequacies, trapped in a timeless limbo. The schmaltzy tunes date from the Twenties and Thirties; the outfits are more or less Fifties. What dates this generation, though, is the social convention of dancing in couples or as a unison group, situations ripe with the potential for humiliation. The original cast were members of Bausch's Wuppertal Tanztheater company, an international ensemble of dancers and actors. Their Kontakthof encounters were drawn from childhood memories of their parents' world and their own experience of auditioning as performers. The two leading women were wonderful, uninhibited Australians - Jo-Ann Endicott and Meryl Tankard, who cackled like kookaburras. The present cast are Wuppertal pensioners, not professionals: they are required to be themselves, while replicating the actions of their younger predecessors. Gains and losses almost cancel each other out in this age-shift. Bausch has given up control of a highly calculated theatre piece for the poignancy of well-worn bodies and genuine embarrassment. We're forced to examine whether we are laughing with game old girls or jeering at the deluded gents who lust after them. When performers nervously fumble for words, there's a worry they may have lost the plot; when they fall to the floor, they might not be able to scramble up again. They're a robust group or they wouldn't be on stage, but their theatrical timing is off and they don't own their stories. They're doggedly doing what they've been told, without the sardonic energy of the original performers. What they have instead is the melancholy of second childhood. The games they play are Bausch specialities: they go through the motions of pinching, slapping and groping each other like a half-forgotten playground ritual. Over three hours, however, their own personalities rub through, extraordinary in their ordinariness. By the time the repeated line dance comes round again, they have reclaimed their dignity. Bausch was right to trust them. Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker! is also a revival of an earlier work, with an exclamation mark to remind us that he has come a long way since 1992. Although he has worked with children in musicals (including Oliver!), he uses a grown-up cast for his Dickensian vision of Christmas. That way, he can give a knowingly ironic gloss to the show's message: greed and hypocrisy are bad, in adults as in children. His cast's observation of underage behaviour is acute. Clara (Etta Murfitt) and her fellow waifs and strays from Dr Dross's orphanage exhibit traits that will stay with them all their lives. Just like the old folk in Kontakthof , there's the brash show-off, the sensitive soul, the nerd, the practical joker, the cutie-pie. Clara herself is desperately needy, destined, you'd think, to be a loser. You would be wrong, of course, although her nightmare looks like coming true until the very last moments. Bourne has amplified his staging to make his new Nutcracker! a dance-driven show. In Act 1, to impress the orphanage governors, the foundlings are required to perform an exhaustive set of routines: Dalcroze eurythmics and health-and-beauty exercises, as well as social dances and the odd bit of tap. The scenario is put on hold until, after lights-out, the Nutcracker monster leads a children's crusade against oppression. Where anarchy should reign during the ensuing pillow-fight, the moves are so elaborate that the battle lumbers to a close. Tchaikovsky saves the day with his snowflake music and the act ends with a blissful skating scene, frozen smiles and poses conveying speed as the boys flap the girls' satin skirts. A coup de glace, it's the sweetest tableau in the show. Act 11 tries too hard. Anthony Ward's designs for the confectionery kingdom are wittily glutinous; like Barbie and Barbara Cart land, he believes you can't have too much pink. An overdose of sugar, though, corrodes the imagination. Bourne's choreographic ideas flag just when the score demands sustained flights of inspiration. Where he once got by on cheek and gleeful humour, he's now straining for effect - and his dancers aren't technically proficient enough to dazzle in their own right. Children will certainly revel in the orphans' antics and their finger-licking transformations in the second half. Adults may find their grins fading before the two hours are up.

Their controversial message is direct: Britain is overpopulated and does not need any more immigrants. The work of Migrationwatch UK now dominates the immigration debate. It has prompted stories such as 'One in Ten Londoners is an Immigrant', 'Illegals Put NHS at Breaking Point' and '400 New Schools Needed for Asylum Seekers'. Last week, Home Office figures showed the number of asylum seekers entering the country this year is likely to top 100,000. Migrationwatch believes figures such as these show it was right to alert the nation to a coming disaster. They argue that mass immigration will drive up the population with disastrous consequences for the environment, social cohesion and public health. But what exactly is Migrationwatch UK? It was founded by Sir Andrew Green, a retired career diplomat who was Britain's ambassador to Syria and Saudi Arabia. Green has been obsessed by Britain's asylum laws since the mid-1990s, when, as a Foreign Office official, he was tasked with deporting the Islamic dissident Mohammed al-Massari from Britain. 'We wanted him out, the Saudis wanted him out and we spent 18 months trying to get him out. When we failed I realised the asylum system was in chaos.' He met his collaborator David Coleman, professor in demography at Oxford University though the letters page of the Times. When Green set up the Migrationwatch website at the end of last year Coleman became his adviser. Their research consisted of the simple analysis of government population projections, which they hoped would spark a debate. 'We had no reaction at all. Nobody wanted to discuss the issue,' Green told The Observer. The turning point for Migrationwatch, came in June, when the environment editor of the Times, Anthony Browne, wrote an article arguing for tighter immigration controls. 'He said the economic reasons for mass immigration were as bogus as any asylum seeker. I thought that was brave,' said Green. The two men had lunch and Browne wrote the story of the ex-ambassador who was devoting his life to the immigration debate. At the beginning of August, when Migrationwatch published a paper claiming net immigration would rise by two million within a decade, the rest of the press finally caught on to the group. Green claims they received 160 calls in one day after the report was published. The Home Office briefed against the report, but later Green was called before the Home Affairs Select Committee along with representatives from the Refugee Council and the Immigration Advisory Service. Migrationwatch had arrived. Smith and Coleman say they are presenting the facts. Until 1982, they say, more people left Britain than entered it. But for two decades now the opposite has been the case. Coleman said: 'I was surprised at the controversy over the summer. It's a pity it has to be like this, because heat is not a good environment for discussion.' He, like Green, said Migrationwatch did not have a political agenda. 'What matters is that the facts are put forward and that the arguments are cogent,' he said. Browne said it was an important voice in the debate. 'I think it is dangerous to impose mass immigration on a people who don't want it. Basically, we just let in anyone who turns up even when there are noticeable drawbacks? Albanian, Kurdish, Pakistani and Jamaican organised criminals, Islamic fascists openly calling for the death of all Jews, TB at Third World levels, riots in northern towns, overcrowding in London, shortage of housing and so on.' But some believe the arguments proposed by Browne, Greene and Coleman are not entirely neutral. Writing in Prospect magazine earlier this year, Nigel Harris, the author and immigration expert, said: 'The fears and resentments that underlie the need to blame foreigners are real enough. Structural change damages some and benefits others. But in general, foreigners... are irrelevant to these processes. They are simply scapegoats.' Leigh Daynes, of Refugee Action, said Migrationwatch was not independent: 'It is a partisan pressure group, whose influence far exceeds its authority. Its sole objective is to fuel ill-informed public debate on migration by polarising the issues. There is an absolute and fundamental difference between migration and asylum. Migrationwatch seeks to obscure this fact. ' The right-wing credentials of Migrationwatch are well-established. Coleman was special adviser to former Tory Ministers Leon Brittan and William Waldegrave. Green was one of the Tories' favourite diplomats. He is a close friend of disgraced former Minister Jonathan Aitken. Green sits with Aitken on the board of Christian Solidarity Worldwide, an organisation that controversially campaigns on alleged slavery in Sudan. Green told The Observer: 'Jonathan Aitken is a very nice man indeed. I have a very high opinion of him and he has completely changed his life around. It would be extremely unfortunate that anyone would regard it as a criticism, and frankly I don't care.' Questions were raised when Green was appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia in 1996, about his role as non-executive director of Vickers, an arms company with links to Saudi Arabia. The al-Massari case, about which he feels so passionately, was connected to a Vickers contract to supply tanks to Saudi Arabia. The contract was thought to be under threat if the British government failed to deport the dissident. Green said the Vickers job was unpaid and part of a Foreign Office scheme to give senior civil servants business experience. Labour MP Tam Dalyell has raised questions in Parliament about meetings Green held with another controversial figure, Colonel Oliver North. He met North while working at the British embassy in Washington between 1982 to 1985. North was later prosecuted for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. North arranged for the sale of arms to Iran in return for the release of Western hostages in the Middle East. The cash was used to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua. In April 1995, Dalyell asked the Foreign Minister Douglas Hogg why Green had met North in May 1984 to discuss the role of the British Parliament in the hostage crisis and why he had met North in July 1984 to discuss rescue missions. Hogg said: 'In the mid-1980s members of the British embassy in Washington kept in close touch with the US Administration, including the National Security Council, on matters concerning hostages and on terrorism more generally. This was, and remains, a normal part of the embassy's work.' Green confirmed that he had met North during this period: 'Oliver North was a member of the National Security Council. I was the man in the embassy asked to meet with him.' An Amnesty International spokesperson said there had been concerns about British policy in Saudi Arabia during Green's tenure as ambassador from 1996 to 2000: 'While Amnesty International is aware that diplomatic pressure is often extremely useful, it is nevertheless worried that the UK Government's stance reflects a desire to preserve good relations with Saudi Arabia at the expense of raising human rights issues affecting British and other nationals in the kingdom.' Green insists Migrationwatch is not an ego trip. But he is now a public figure heading a controversial organisation. As the group's influence grows within the political arena, it is inevitable that the public will want to know more about his career in the Middle East and how it informs his views."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2002/nov/30/architecture.artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-30T02:11:28Z","webTitle":"Mies and the Nazis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/30/architecture.artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/30/architecture.artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Mies and the Nazis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On the morning of April 11 1933, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe turned up for work as normal. It was not a normal day. The Bauhaus, the 20th century's greatest school of art, architecture and design, was closed. The building was cordoned off by armed police and surrounded by crowds. Mies' pace quickened. \"Stop!\" he shouted at the officers. \"What's the idea? This is my school! It belongs to me!\" Not any more, said an officer: the Gestapo was scouring the school for a secret printing press suspected of publishing anti-Nazi propaganda, and documents linking Bauhaus to the Communist party. Mies was released after an interrogation. But the Bauhaus stayed shut. The next day, Mies, knuckle-headed and stubborn as ever, went to the top. Alfred Rosenberg, the conservative minister of culture in the newly elected Nazi government, was renowned for his iron temperament. But then, so was Mies. \"The Bauhaus has a certain idea,\" began Mies, in his nagging, methodical monotone, \"but this idea has nothing to do with politics. Look at your writing table, this shabby writing table. Do you like it? I would throw it out the window.\" Mies rarely minced his words. \"That is what we at the Bauhaus want to do. We want to have good objects so that we do not have to throw them out of the window.\" Rosenberg was an architect himself. \"Then we will understand each other,\" said Mies. \"What do you expect me to do?\" asked Rosenberg. \"The Bauhaus is supported by forces fighting our forces.\" \"For any cultural effort,\" replied Mies, \"one needs peace, and I would like to know whether we will have that peace.\" The Bauhaus stayed shut. So Mies tried another route. Every other day, he marched to Gestapo headquarters. This time, it took him three months to get to the top. On July 21, with the Bauhaus on the brink of bankruptcy, a letter arrived from the Gestapo giving permission to reopen, but only if the curriculum was rewritten to suit \"the demands of the new State\", and if two of its leftwing teachers, Ludwig Hilberseimer and the painter Vasili Kandinsky, were replaced with \"individuals who guarantee to support the principles of the National Socialist ideology\". Mies gathered his colleagues, opened the champagne, and promptly closed the school himself. Mies was pathologically strong-willed, so protective of his independence that he would close his own school rather than submit to the demands of anyone else. Even the Nazis. Mies had schooled himself as modernism's cold, steely heart. He wasn't verbose and dilettantish like Le Corbusier. He didn't douse himself with sociology like Walter Gropius. He didn't dress the flamboyant dandy like Frank Lloyd Wright, all cape and cane. All were diversions, Mies thought. Instead, he presented himself as a monolithic figure, silent and sober, like a monk. He read St Thomas Aquinas, St Augustine, Plato and Nietzsche. He had certainty. He had a plan, and politics wasn't part of it. Which was exactly why he'd ended up at the Bauhaus. By 1933, the school was a global cult, sending out from its converted telephone factory eager young missionaries to spread the modernist word: honesty of construction, death to decoration. Under its first director, Gropius, and its second, Hannes Meyer, these students were also trained in socialism - the efficient, industrial mass production of \"good objects\" for the people, which had led it into often violent controversy. Mies was made director to bring order and discipline, and above all to make the Bauhaus apolitical. In 1930s Berlin, however, the politics of architecture would prove impossible to ignore. Mies believed, he said, in something more noble than politics, the ruthless pursuit of the perfect modern building, the true heir, he thought, to Greek temples and gothic cathedrals - buildings constructed on earth in order to escape it. These were cathedrals for the new religion, commerce and industry - factories, office blocks, skyscrapers and apartment towers, the modern urban landscape, whose architecture had yet to be invented. The form lay out there for him to discover. \"The will of the epoch,\" he said, must be \"translated into space\" - as if he were just the draughtsman for a higher system, the universe's appointed architect. Mies is known now for his American architecture - it was there that he was able to make his modern \"cathedrals\" a reality. But it was in Berlin, in the prewar years, that his ideas were formed. Like his students, he was a convert to modernism. In Berlin's cultural explosion of the early 1920s, Mies, then in his mid 30s, switched lives. Out went the provincial name, Ludwig Mies, with its reminders of his lower-middle-class upbringing in the deeply conservative Catholic Rhineland. In came the more cosmopolitan Mies van der Rohe. Out went his conventional wife and children, relegated to annual visits. In came a succession of mistresses, and wild nights with Berlin's avant garde. And out went Mies' formal classical design, taught to him by architects struggling to come to terms with the 20th century, attempting to stretch the styles of the past around radical new building types such as the modern factory. Sometimes these old styles just wouldn't fit. Modern buildings required a whole new architecture. Like any eager convert, Mies took modernism to extremes. Throughout his life, nothing got in the way of his quest for pure form: politics, family, mistresses, clients, ideas that ill fitted his single-minded worldview - all were brushed aside. Even practicality. In the 1930s, he designed furniture that users \"must learn to love\"; and, after the war, venetian blinds on New York's Seagram Building that would stop only in aesthetically pleasing positions (backed up with contractual subclauses to ensure that nobody replaced them with drapes of lesser beauty); Berlin's National Gallery without walls (they might interrupt its vast empty space); and houses, such as the Farnsworth House in the US, that had a notorious aversion to ugly essentials such as plumbing, heating and mosquito nets. He would bully his clients to the law courts to get his way, the very model of the arrogant architect. All of which would have been unforgivable were his buildings not breathtaking. Mies took the modern steel frame, which removed the structural need for walls, as far as it could then go, to create the kinds of crisp, idealised, abstract spaces that his contemporaries in the visual arts, Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesberg, were exploring on canvas. He once built a chapel in the US so bare, so pure, that it had to have a sign attached - \"Chapel\" - to tell the visitor where they were. \"God,\" he said, \"is in the details.\" This was a man whose eye had been trained by chiselling headstones in his father's stonemason's yard, who could spend days perfecting the cross-section of a beam and weeks labouring over minute mathematical ratios that only he could see. He created his masterpiece, the German Pavilion at the Barcelona Exposition, in 1929: a series of empty spaces, removed of every physical encumbrance that technology would allow. Enclosure was suggested only by a series of planes, arranged with formal geometry, like a Mondrian painting. Nothingness, transparency, was used as a kind of expression. Visitors would touch its floor-to-ceiling glass walls, the world's first, to see how they stood up - if they stood up. The whole building appeared so lightweight that it threatened to float away into the sky. \"It contains only space,\" dismissed one critic. But that was the point. The world had seen nothing like it. We're used to open-plan homes and offices today, but in 1929 it was a revolution to the senses. This, said one newspaper report at the time, was \"the modern feeling\". This was exactly why Germany's pre-Nazi Weimar Republic had chosen Mies to represent it. During the 1920s, it had fashioned itself into the most modernist of states. If you were a young designer, hungry for work, Germany - and, most of all, the Bauhaus - was where you came. For the Barcelona fair, the Weimar government wanted to project the image of a modern, progressive, peaceful Germany, emerging again on the world stage after the humiliations of the first world war. \"We do not want anything but clarity, simplicity, honesty,\" said Georg von Schnitzler, commissar general of the Reich, at the official opening. Not that Mies bought this, of course. A building, to him, was not a piece of propaganda, but something to escape worldly distractions such as politics. Still, so long as it brought in work, he was happy to play along: he didn't care for whom he built, so long as they had lots of money, lots of power and didn't get in his way. So Mies, Weimar Germany's rising star, designed the kinds of buildings that his newly prosperous country would need, such as the world's first glass-and-steel skyscraper, a stunning shaft of quartz; the first modern office block, which, 50 years before the Pompidou Centre and the Lloyd's building, used its guts, its structure, as abstract exterior decoration; and, at Barcelona, the world's first truly open-plan house. He had time only to build the last. A few weeks after the Barcelona fair opened, stock markets across the world crashed. The Depression dried up his stock of wealthy German clients and a new kind of German politics was on the horizon. It, too, would use architecture as propaganda. But it wasn't Mies' kind of architecture. It was hard for someone to ignore politics in 1930s Germany, but Mies did his best. To this freakishly single-minded man, the rise of nazism was like a fly buzzing around him while he worked, getting ever closer and increasingly destroying his concentration. When the Bauhaus closed in 1933, it seemed as if Alfred Rosenberg's völkisch rightwing had the upper hand, with their sentimental attachment to folksy architecture. With them in charge, the very pitch of your roof could land you in trouble. They'd had their eye on the Bauhaus's internationalist cult for years. In 1925, the school, then led by Gropius, was forced to leave Weimar, Germany's intellectual heart, by the city's rightwing. It was drummed out of Dessau in 1932, too, when local Nazis took the council. They threatened to build proper Teutonic pitched roofs and gables on the building's bolshevik flat roofs to show who was boss now. The Nazis even found fault with Mies' thoroughly apolitical directorship when he moved the school to Berlin, simply for what they thought his abstract modernism represented. Leaving aside the school's degenerate, internationalist, rootless, Jewish, bolshevik membership, the newly christened International Style - white walls, steel and glass, and flat roofs - just wasn't German. Yet Hitler himself had not quite made up his mind about modern architecture. In the early 1930s, he was strongly influenced by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, who had recognised the progressive, symbolic power of industrial modernism - it might be useful. In early September 1933, Hitler spoke at a culture conference, fiercely criticising radical art but accepting \"a functionalism of crystalline clarity\" in design. Like Mies, Hitler was obsessed with industrialism, the symbolism of technology, the theatre of getting things done. He even spoke the Bauhaus language: \"To be German,\" said Hitler, \"means to be logical, above all to be truthful.\" Music to Mies'ears. Industrial modernism could so easily have become the language of autobahns and vast Nazi meeting halls. Starved of work, Mies tried to ingratiate himself with this new, powerful and rich state patron, signing a motion of support for Hitler in the August 1934 referendum and joining Goebbels's Reichskultur-kammer, a progressive alternative to Rosenberg's ministry, which asked for \"fresh blood\" and new forms to give \"expression to this age\". Mies was shortlisted to build the state's new Reichsbank, with a fiercely modern, abstract design; and Goebbels even pressed him to design the Deutsches Volk Deutsches Arbeit exhibition. Things were on the up. But in 1934, Hitler, by chance, came across Albert Speer, a young architect who had caught the Nazi bug. Speer had joined the party as head of its local Motorists' Association, and only as its head because he was the only car driver in his neighbourhood. There just happened to be a lot of influential Nazis at the Wannsee local HQ. With furious speed, Speer found himself spun from apprentice to chief architect for Goebbels's propaganda ministry, then to designer for Nazi rallies at Tempelhof Field, and then, in 1934, to Hitler's personal architect, designing, the Führer promised, \"buildings for me such as haven't been built perhaps for 4,000 years\". Speer never quite understood his luck. All it took to end modernism, and Mies, in Germany was Hitler and Speer's obsessive personal relationship. Hitler was an amateur architect, a trainspotter - he had once been refused admission to the Viennese Academy's architecture school - and liked nothing better on a Sunday afternoon than to pore over plans with eager-to-please Speer. He would discuss the minutiae of cross-sections and tinker with designs, which he always referred to as \"my building plans\", as if Speer were merely the conduit for Hitler's grand visions. But where Goebbels challenged Hitler's taste for sentimental nationalist architecture, Speer indulged it. Speer was a first-rate administrator, but a second-rate architect, a decent enough exponent of the polite classicism that Mies had ditched years earlier, but a dab hand at the kind of populist theatricality that caught the Führer's eye. And so, by chance, it was decided that the Third Reich's landscape was not to be the sleek, industrial modernism of the Barcelona Pavilion, but Hansel and Gretel gothic, and a bombastic classicism of inflated porticoes, pediments and columns, with all their cheap analogies with the Roman empire. With Leni Riefenstahl, Speer became the Nazi's stage manager, designing ever larger, more extravagant stage sets, from the Nuremberg rally complex to the Cathedral of Light, 130 anti-aircraft searchlights shooting in the air, their thrusting verticality, apparently, to lead the eye away from the paunches of the marching party leaders. And, of course, there was Hitler's special commission, the complete rebuilding of Berlin, followed by every other major German city. Hitler so adored Speer's vast detailed model of a Berlin reborn, complete with ambitious domes and giant's avenues, that he would gaze lovingly at what might have been while burrowed deep in his bunker in 1945, with the allies at the door. With Speer now in charge, the conservatives extended the cultural policy of Gleichschaltung (bringing in line) from publishing and art to building, simply by controlling the planning system and making sure they had the right sort of people on competition juries. Hitler cancelled the Reichsbank competition on which Mies was depending financially. And every architect was forced to adjust his or her style to suit. Except Mies. He didn't know any other way. Between 1931 and 1938, only two out of 12 houses were actually built. But, though politics had caught up with him, Mies kept ploughing on. He was even willing to bend his design to suit the Nazis. Slightly. His competition entry for the national pavilion at the 1935 Brussels World's Fair was his last attempt to angle German national architecture towards modernism. The abstract plan is there, only it is grander, more symmetrical than usual; the stark, plain walls are there, but Mies would never have added an eagle and swastika - decoration - in happier times. In the end, there was no money for the pavilion; not that he'd have won. Speer's pompous national pavilion at the Paris fair in 1937 was more to Nazi taste now. And how strikingly similar it looked, remarked Speer himself, to the Soviet pavilion sitting opposite. Mies seemed to dislike the Nazis more for their poor taste and their starving him of work than for their politics. Nazi architecture, to Mies, was hardly architecture at all, mere stage sets, \"sentimental\", emotional. It was an aberration, something that got in the way of his ideal of pure, abstract modernism. He never passed comment directly on Speer, but it must have galled him to see this youngster succeed with so little. Designing the will of the epoch, the architecture for the German state, was once meant to be Mies' job. In this upstart's hands, it was being realised in the clumsiest of forms. So, stubborn to the last, Mies just sat it out, waiting for change, waiting for the latest obstruction to shift, and damning the Nazis the way he damned family, lovers and everything else that got in his way: with silent withdrawal. More solitary than ever, and getting by on the royalties from his furniture, Mies spent the mid-1930s designing endless variations of prototypical, ideal buildings - the museum, the office, the university - each, like Erik Satie's Gymnopedies, variations on a theme, subtly different from the last. They remained on paper. He built up a backlog of fantasies that he'd build one day, once the Nazis had disappeared. And he had every faith that they would. But Mies' reluctance to condemn Nazi politics saw him attacked by many of his former Bauhaus colleagues, many of whom, Jewish or leftwing, had left for Britain and the US soon after the Nazis took power. Like many other less threatened German artists, such as the composer Richard Strauss, Mies hung on longer than he should simply because he refused to believe that Germany, once a hotbed of cultural invention, had suddenly become so stupid. Mies finally decided to leave Germany while standing in a field in Wisconsin in late 1937. He was in the US following up one of the many offers of work from wealthy Americans, which had started coming his way after a star billing at the opening exhibition of New York's new Museum of Modern Art in 1932. Since he was in the neighbourhood, he decided to visit Frank Lloyd Wright, the doyen of American architecture, in his Wisconsin ideas factory, Taliesin West. Mies liked the midwest, with its flat, empty, abstract fields, ripe for his otherworldly spaces. It suited his aesthetic. And, deep in the belly of the continent, far from the Nazis - far, indeed, from any interference - it suited his way of working. No one would disturb him here. Standing in a field outside Wright's studio, he shouted, \"Freiheit! Es ist ein Reich!\" (\"Freedom! This is a kingdom!\") Mies had packed for an overnight stay, but ended up staying a week. \"Poor Mr Mies,\" said Wright. \"His white shirt is quite grey!\" Mies liked America, too. After the Depression, it was becoming fat again, with rich capitalists ready to commission him. Mies could always sniff out where the money and power was. And he could smell in those fields that his future patron would be no government, no political system, but the economic system that was emerging triumphant in the US. Modernism, the International Style, would succeed as the landscape not of communism, bolshevism or nazism, but of international capitalism. Its modern Medicis, such as Mies, weren't interested in politics. Well, not the politics of nationalism, just the quieter, subtler politics of making money. Like the Weimar government, they would commission buildings such as New York's Seagram tower more for their sleek, modern, sellable image, and efficient and highly lucrative ways of parcelling up space - \"Mies means money,\" 1950s speculators chirruped - than for the perfection of their form. They wouldn't see God in the details, but they would leave him alone to build all those ideal skyscrapers, office blocks, houses, convention centres and apartment towers he had spent the 1930s mapping out in his head. He could escape politics. He could build. That was enough. Mies' American friends told him not to return to Berlin in March 1938. They were right. After the Anschluss of Austria, and the previous year's Degenerate Art exhibition in Munich, the climate had become more conservative than ever. Even Mieswas under suspicion, with Nazis sniffing around his associations with communists and Jews in the Bauhaus. Politics had got to him at last. For the first time, he was nervous in his own country, so nervous, in fact, that, to avoid meeting the Gestapo, he sent his assistant to pick up his emigration visa at the local police station. When the assistant returned, he found Mies being roughly interrogated by two officers. At the eleventh hour, the time had come to follow the millions before him and make his own, rather less noble escape from the Nazis. Mies packed what he could in a small suitcase, hurried on to a train to Rotterdam and took the steamer to New York · Mies In Berlin 1905-1938 is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7888), from December 10-March 2.

These, for better or worse, are some of Derry's more famous distinguishing features. But of course there's much more to it than that, and reading Sean McMahon's very useful Derry Anthology, a culling of several centuries' worth of writing about the maiden city, one might discover also that Cecil Frances Alexander, who wrote \"There Is a Green Hill Far Away\" was reminded of Calvary while looking at the green hill of Creggan, that the city is known for its spiced mince and black puddings, and that a popular local children's rhyme runs: \"Proddy, proddy dick/ Your ma can't knit/ And your da/ Won't go to bed/ Without a dummy tit\". The Derry Anthology provides a reminder also that the novelist, rock journalist and self-professed \"Anglo-Tewtomic-Russian-Menshevik-Agnostic-Jew\" Nik Cohn was brought up in Derry, so we have Derry to thank for Saturday Night Fever (based on Cohn's story \"Another Saturday Night\"). And Dana. And Derry is where the Field Day Company was formed, where the Seamuses Deane and Heaney attended St Columb's College, and where John Hume founded Northern Ireland's first Credit Union. Derry, in other words, like anywhere else, can boast an odd, proud and extremely varied cultural and political history. It has its good, and it has its bad. Like any good book The Derry Anthology makes you want to go away and read other books. McMahon includes the work not only of accredited writers - Jennifer Johnston, Brian Friel, Benedict Kiely - but also the requisite contributions from Anon, obscure clerics, and the local papers. On the evidence of the brief extracts included here, the Feis Doire Colmcille Souvenir Book (1999) looks rather interesting, as does Stephen Gwynn's Highways and Byways in Donegal and Antrim (1928), Kathleen Coyle's The Magical Realm (1943), and William Bulfin's robust Rambles in Eirinn (1907). Unusually, The Derry Anthology also makes you want to switch on the radio, in order to catch up with Gerry Anderson, of BBC Radio Foyle, who is clearly a broadcasting genius. Much of the writing in the anthology is what one might call intimate and fond, if not actually fondling: indeed, if you were to believe everything you read in it, you might begin to think that everyone has always loved Derry, except perhaps for the notoriously hard-hearted Paul Theroux and William Makepeace Thackeray. \"From a distance, Derry was lovely and familiar,\" writes Theroux in The Kingdom by the Sea, \"but up close, Derry was frightful.\" Thackeray, in his Irish Sketchbook (1842) was rather more subtle: the lunatic asylum, he notes, is a \"model of neatness and comfort\". This apparent weakness, what one might suspect is a certain over-sensitivity in McMahon's choices, is in fact nothing more or less than the weakness and implausibility of all literature, for the great truth and beauty of books is that what is contained within them is often contrary to what we know of human experience. Anyone who has ever lived there, for example, will know that London is not as Martin Amis describes it, that South Tyneside looks nothing like Catherine Cookson country, that Nottingham is not Robin Hood's, that Dorset is not Wessex, and that even in America you could travel from coast to shining coast without once encountering anything remotely resembling a Beat poem, or Frank O'Hara. And, needless to say, The Derry Anthology does not describe Derry. This is because writers, like readers, live in imaginary places. We all of us have to try to convince ourselves that where we happen to have washed up is somehow special, because otherwise we'd have to face up to the terrible fact that our small insignificant lives in our small insignificant places are not that much different to other people's small insignificant lives in other small insignificant places. To lead a happy and fulfilled life is partly to be able to kid yourself that your own chosen territory is bigger, better, and more interesting than others. So Derry, they say, is different. Which of course it is, to a certain extent: it's like Belfast, with Dublin tendencies. But I think if you read McMahon's book right (which is not the same as reading it as McMahon intends), if you set all the terrible stuff about James and Governor Walker and the guns and bombs and the Brits in the context of what are otherwise perfectly pleasant and pretty bog-standard stories of friendly neighbourhoods and cold schoolrooms, of hills and rivers and streets, of generations growing up and dying amid all the usual human miseries and unhappiness, then it might just convince you of a wonderful truth: Derry is no different. And to believe other-wise is to live in la-la land. · Ian Sansom's The Truth About Babies is published by Granta"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2002/nov/29/kenya.alqaida","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-29T01:26:19Z","webTitle":"Not again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/29/kenya.alqaida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/nov/29/kenya.alqaida","fields":{"headline":"Not again","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"About now is the short rainy season on East Africa's Swahili coast, occasioning blustery winds and a cyclonic squall known by local fishermen as the chamchela. Despite this, and the blighting of the landscape by numerous hotels servicing western tourists, the coastline remains an earthly idyll. Fragrant with spices and frangipani, it is the kind of a place where, on glittering beaches fringed with palm, you might be forgiven for believing you are in paradise. At least till you find yourself at the sharp end of an attack by al-Qaida. If indeed it was al-Qaida. A previously unknown group called the Army of Palestine has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attacks. All one can say for certain is that a wide variety of Palestinian jihadi groups have links to Osama bin Laden's \"deputy\" Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was he who organised the carnage in Luxor in 1997, in which close to 70 western visitors were sprayed with machine-gun fire in the shadow of the Pyramids. The Mombasa and Bali attacks look like a resumption of the policy al-Zawahiri developed for Luxor, which established tourists as legitimate targets and linked the US with Israel. \"Yes, America's enemy is Islamic extremism,\" he said in a communiqué just before Luxor, \"meaning the Islamic Jihad against America's pre-eminence, [the same] Islamic Jihad which stands against Jewish expansion.\" The Swahili coast is an alluring destination for cultural reasons as well as for its coral reefs, translucent water and all those other well-used signifiers of tropical languor. And those cultural reasons have a bearing on the issues raised in Zawahiri's gnomic statement. In the labyrinthine streets of the port city of Mombasa, you can visit mosques and bazaars and ruined palaces, testament to thousands of years of interaction with the Middle East. It was from this coast (sahel giving us Swahili, means coast in Arabic) that the kingdom of Sheba sourced the riches brought to Solomon. The least of its connections with Osama bin Laden, that well-known Saudi of Yemeni stock, is that Sheba's kingdom was based in modern Yemen, where an American missile recently squirrelled down on some of his friends as they rode along through the desert in their car. Did that killing represent \"success\" in the war on terror? Do yesterday's attacks represent \"failure\"? It's hard to measure these things, to develop a calculus of terrorism and counter-terrorism, but right now it seems that the forces of civilisation are firmly on the back foot. Mombasa itself has seen the rise and fall of civilisations, and it is from the embers of these that fundamentalist Islam has coaxed its flames. For thousands of years monsoon winds have enabled dhow traffic between the continent and the Arabian gulf. It was the monsoon which made Mombasa and nearby Zanzibar the last great outposts of the slave trade. Here, in the 19th century, Arab, European and American sailors colluded to avoid British policing of an Indian Ocean trading network based on cruelty. The British navy came too late to prevent the worst of the slave trade. And so it is with the global policemen of our own era, faced with its own hydra-headed challenge. Last time, the Americans arrived in force. What is known in US security circles as a Fest, or foreign emergency search team, borne on a plane called a C-17 Globemaster III, was dispatched to deal with al-Qaida's first big spectacular: the simultaneous bombing of two US embassies early one morning in August 1998. The attacks took place in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, not far down the coast from Mombasa. It was mainly FBI staff who filled the Globemaster's seats four years ago. Wearing all-over Tyvek suits to prevent contamination, carrying sealable bags, forensic specialists collected fragmentary pieces of evidence, looking for the characteristic pitting and cratering that affects metal close to the source of an explosion. Later, using cotton-bud, they swabbed for trace elements, trying to find the minute residues of chemicals which can give a clue to the origin of weaponry. Investigating agents began the long round of interviews with witnesses and suspects, gathering material for the investigation, which led over a period of years to the apprehension of culprits, a trial in New York and something like justice. Well, that was how it happened before: the trial of some of those responsible for the 1998 bombings concluding just as the September 11 attacks of 2001 shook America and all of us out of complacency. Defence submissions argued that the methods used by the US, in conjunction with local authorities, to gather information in Kenya and Tanzania violated human rights. The Muslim community in both countries was put under pressure and that may well turn out to be a factor behind yesterday's attacks. During the trial, it emerged that the sleeper cell which planned the 1998 truck attacks was based in Mombasa, fronted by a fishing business. As yesterday, the pattern of attack again involved one man getting out and setting off a small explosion (grenades in Nairobi) while others blew themselves up in a vehicle in a larger explosion. Long before September 11, the US knew what it was dealing with in al-Qaida: that observation has become a standard one in commentary on this issue. What might seem astonishing now, as we consider a second attack on the Swahili coast, is that intelligence agencies weren't able to prevent it using information gathered in the area since 1998, presumably with more intensity since September 11. If there is any index by which we can judge the failure or success of the war on terror, this must be it. Massive resources have been deployed; funding has been made available to local governments; US navy patrols have been scouring the Horn of Africa since this time last year. In part this is because of worries of attacks on oil tankers. Another reason is Somalia, the southern coastline of which adjoins Kenya's in one of the most lawless places in the world: an easy jumping-off point for someone wanting to transport missiles or explosives. The Somali connection has some bearing on yesterday's attacks. The fiasco of the US intervention in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, in 1993 saw a Black Hawk helicopter downed and American servicemen torn to pieces by a mob. At the time, it seemed to have nothing to do with bin Laden, then not \"well-known\" at all except to a few CIA field officers and the Saudi government. The trial of the 1998 embassy bombers, however, revealed that some of the Mombasa cell had travelled to Mogadishu to foment trouble five years before. One was involved in transporting shoulder-launched missiles, such as were fired at an Israeli airliner yesterday. The CIA now uses a technique called pattern analysis to compare terrorist actions. As details of the latest attacks emerge, it is tempting to apply pattern analysis to the way they are reported. One of the questions that will be asked is: was this al-Qaida? Another is: were the perpetrators local or from abroad? Most knuckle-headed of all: was it Bin Laden? All are based on misconceptions that seem to be hindering both the war on terror and examination of it. Al-Qaida is not a nucleus, with a definable centre. It's a network idea, a loose affiliation. And it operates on the principle of subsidiarity, to borrow a term usually associated with the EU. Yossef Bodansky, director of the US congressional task force on terrorism, puts it like this: \"Al-Qaida is a wide tent without walls that serves as an umbrella for all the like-minded. The structure is vague and usually locally adapted to fit prevailing conditions at each and every locale. Hence, the endemic problems we're facing in rolling them back.\" Author of the first and still the best biography of Bin Laden (published in 1999, long before September 11), Bodansky says he doesn't have a catchphrase for this myriad of cells and networks, just professional respect and growing apprehension. \"They defy all past frameworks western intelligence got used to following in order to identify terrorist threats.\" Bin Laden's role is mainly inspirational, and one of the ways he inspires is to concentrate propaganda efforts in areas like East Africa, Nigeria or Indonesia, where there are already tensions between Christians and Muslims. There is an inflammatory history of this kind of thing on the Swahili coast, where the problem is ethnic as well as religious. Varying mixed layers of Arab and African inheritance combine with the legacy of European imperialism in a witch's brew of potential trouble. Arabs and Portuguese fought over the region from 1503 to 1652. An Omani dynasty based in Mombasa ruled the coast from 1701, moving to Zanzibar in 1841. Mosques in Zanzibar and Mombasa have been the intellectual centre of the Islamisation of Africa ever since. From 1886 until 1920, in the early period of British colonisation, the Sultan of Oman leased a coastal strip, including Mombasa, on the mainland. In 1964 after independence and a bloody revolution, many Arab-Africans fled Zanzibar for Mombasa and Oman. A radical Islamic website discussing the region gives a sense of why al-Qaida can count on support there.It draws a direct line from Prince Henry the Navigator, the Portuguese monarch whose fleets were the first to come to the area from Europe, to former President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. For Nyerere and his successors, like their Kenyan counterparts, the Islamic issue has been a thorny one, the Muslim coast not feeling it is properly represented and often subject to brutal treatment. Alleging various policies of annihilation (a number of Muslims were baked to death in a copra-kiln during the Zanzibari revolution), assimilation and secularisation, the author of the website points out that \"similar strategies were successfully used by the Catholics against the Muslims in the Mindanao islands\" - the area of the Philippines which is another focus of US action against al-Qaida. Holiday destinations such as the Philippines, Bali and Mombasa are soft targets, their porous borders enabling easy access for al-Qaida operatives wanting to link up with local groups. Such places may be \"paradise\" to tourists, but to the suicide bomber that word means something altogether different. This clash of meanings raises issues of globalisation that go beyond the war on terror. Every course of action that might be taken in that offensive seems likely to end up entwined in the cause.

Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, says he is \"outraged\" by suggestions that charitable donations made by his wife may have ended up with two men allegedly associated with the September 11 hijackers. But that has not prevented some barbed US political attacks on the Saudi government, even before an FBI inquiry is concluded. The Saudis have \"played a duplicitous game\", says US senator Charles Schumer, by effectively buying off terrorists and turning a blind eye to their activities. Richard Lugar, the incoming chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, says \"disturbing issues\" have been raised, and that the US must insist on a Saudi crackdown on terror financiers. This is but the latest in a series of public spats that began after September 11, when the US discovered that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis and that al-Qaida's operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere appeared to have been financed with monies emanating from the desert kingdom. American accusations of official or unofficial Saudi complicity in terrorism have ebbed and flowed ever since, usually channelled through the US media. After the Bali bombing, for instance, there were reports that a Saudi businessman helped finance the atrocity. Even the august New York Times has joined in. \"One of the disturbing realities clarified by last month's attacks is Saudi Arabia's tolerance for terrorism,\" the paper said in October last year. \"With Riyadh's acquiescence, money and manpower from Saudi Arabia helped create and sustain Osama bin Laden's terrorist organisation.\" One well-known American columnist, reflecting a tide of anti-Saudi feeling, has even urged George Bush to invade Saudi Arabia and turn it into a giant US \"self-serve gas pump\". The attacks on the Saudis often seemed to be based on US intelligence and other information leaked by American officials concerned that not enough is being done by their own government. Last summer, an explosive classified intelligence briefing to the Pentagon's defence advisory board was surreptitiously made public. \"The Saudis are active at every level of the terror chain, from planners to financiers, from cadre to foot soldier, from ideologist to cheerleader,\" the report stated. It described the kingdom as \"the kernel of evil, the prime mover, the most dangerous opponent\" that the US faced anywhere in the Middle East. \"Saudi Arabia supports out enemies and attacks our allies\". As the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, quickly pointed out at the time, the report did not reflect official US policy. Indeed, each flurry of anti-Saudi agitation in the US has usually been followed by placatory and conciliatory statements from the Bush administration. Last autumn, Ari Fleischer, George Bush's chief spokesman, said the president was \"very pleased with the kingdom's contributions\" to the war on terror. This week, after the latest row, Fleischer repeated himself. \"The president believes that Saudi Arabia has been a good partner,\" he said, although he added that it \"can do more\". Earlier this year, Bush afforded Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's de facto ruler, the signal honour of an invitation to his Texas ranch, and listened attentively to his ideas about a Palestinian-Israeli settlement. At one point last August, Bush assured Bin Sultan of the two countries' \"eternal friendship\". The US also downplays Saudi Arabia's appalling human rights abuses, its lack of democratic freedoms and of a free press, and its denial of women's rights - all key justifications, by the way, proffered for the US overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Speaking during a visit to Mexico this week, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, again went out of his way to coddle the Saudi princes. Concerns about terrorism, he said, should not lead the US \"to the point where we rupture relations with a country that has been a good friend\". This is actually quite amazing, if US reactions to other countries in similar circumstances are considered. If the state in question were Iran, for example, it would probably have been attacked by now. This smacks of appeasement. So what is really going on here? Why, in its ruthless pursuit of the September 11 murderers and their supporters - a chase that has encompassed most of the Middle East and south and south-east Asia - is the Bush administration so loath to confront the Saudis? Why, if there is persuasive evidence of Saudi complicity in those and subsequent attacks, has stern action (such as sanctions or trade embargoes) not been taken, or at least formal, public diplomatic protests made? Why indeed is the current focus of US military and diplomatic efforts on Baghdad, not Riyadh? Why, in other words, does Bush, not known for being a man who bites his lip when it comes to terrorism, look at the Saudis and turn the other cheek? Well, the answer could be that all these anti-Saudi allegations are foul and unjustified calumnies for which there is not a shred of evidence. But if you believe that, you can stop reading right here (and maybe seek professional help). Or it could be that, sad to say, the Bush administration is operating a double standard. It could be that the US government is only too aware of the Saudi terror connection, but is not prosecuting it vigorously on behalf of the September 11 victims and the American people because it has other priorities. What might they be? One easy answer is oil. Saudi Arabia provides 17% of daily US oil needs and, more important in strategic terms, controls about 25% of global reserves. Despite attempts to diversify America's supply, US dependence on Persian Gulf oil is projected to increase, not decrease, in the next 20 years. All major production increases in that period are also expected to come in and around the Gulf; Saudi Arabia is the only producer with enough spare capacity to keep the world market stable and prevent price \"spikes\" in times of crisis. Without Saudi Arabia, it is no exaggeration to say the US economic motor could quickly conk out. Another priority is Israel. Without US protection, military aid and financial backing, Israel's very existence would be in continuing doubt. As it is, with the rulers of Saudi Arabia (and Egypt and Jordan) on America's diplomatic team, the enmity of rejectionist Arabs and hardliners in Iran can be kept at bay and the illusion of a peace process maintained. This also means that Israel's current government, led by Bush friend and ally Ariel Sharon, can continue its repression of the Palestinians almost with impunity. This is why Bush listened politely to Abdullah's peace plan in Texas (and then held out the prospect of a Palestinian state one distant day). The US needs to keep the Saudis sweet if a lid is to be kept on the intifada, and if Jewish interests, in Israel and the US, are to be maintained. Another priority is Iraq. The US has large military bases in Saudi Arabia and will want to use them in any attack on Iraq. Whether or not it gets permission to do so, it still needs to keep the Saudis on board during a war. If the Saudis, guardians of Mecca and the holy shrines and the heartland of Islam, made a stand against war, the peoples of the whole Gulf region and Egypt and Jordan might follow in opposing the US and its allies. It would not just be a military logistics problem then. Like Bush, the Saudis have a score to settle with Saddam Hussein. They fear him for what he did in 1990 and might, one day, do again. They want him gone. And let us not forget: Iraq's oil is important, too. It has 11% of known world reserves and (even now) the US continues to be the biggest single purchaser of Iraqi oil. The US and Saudi governments have a shared economic interest in, shall we say, regulating that supply. The US will also need help in paying for any war and subsequent occupation. There are other reasons, too, for the Bush administration's appeasement of the Saudis. One is the concern that the weak Saudi monarchy, while objectionable in many ways, could be replaced by something far worse - such as an Islamist fundamentalist regime of the type that seized power in Iran in 1979. Better the devil you know, as they say in Christendom, than the devil you don't. So, for the sake of all of the above, it appears that - when it comes to Saudi Arabia - the Bush administration is fighting its \"war on terror\" with its right hand tied behind its back, its left eye closed, and shackles round its ankles. But those constraints are entirely self-imposed. It is for the American people to judge whether this is a wise or honourable policy and whether, in Bush's endlessly repeated phrase, it truly serves \"freedom's cause\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2002/nov/28/art.artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-28T12:17:19Z","webTitle":"10 years of Artangel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/28/art.artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/28/art.artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Build it up, knock it down","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ten years ago, I sat one rainy February morning in the Clock Room in the British Museum with Juan Munoz. We were spending the day wandering between Bloomsbury, Lincoln's Inn and the South Bank with a tape recorder, as a preamble to a radio conversation that we were going to have later that same year. He said that this room, with its dozens of functioning timepieces and clocks that hadn't moved in centuries, had \"a beautiful futility\". At the time he had begun working on his A Man in a Room, Gambling, a series of 10 five-minute radio vignettes in which Munoz, in the guise of an expert, explained the mechanics of a number of card tricks, set to music composed and performed by Gavin Bryars. It would be another five years before he took part in a live performance of this work, with Bryars, at a 1930s BBC radio studio in west London. That morning, we had also visited the work he had made for the exhibition Doubletake at London's Hayward Gallery, which was about to open. The monument, a plain stone structure whose form was in part derived from Edwin Lutyens's Cenotaph, stood on the riverside walkway at some distance from the gallery and lacked any commemoration or dedication whatsoever. Three short bronze flagpoles emerged from one face of the stone. The monument's purpose was unfixed, though there were those who imagined, erroneously, that it commemorated the tragic sinking of a Thames pleasure cruiser, which was much on people's minds at the time. This sculpture - if it is a sculpture, though we might see it more as an image of a monument than a monument itself - stood at a tangent to time. It stood - quite literally - apart from its context as a work in an exhibition, as well as from all the other monuments that occupy public spaces in our cities. And one day, it vanished. Tony Oursler's haunting in the park, The Influence Machine, manifested just such ethereal traces, from the ghost of the 18th-century inventor of optical phantasmagoria, Etienne-Gaspard Robertson, to John Logie Baird, whose first experiments in television took place in an upper room just down Frith Street from Soho Square, where The Influence Machine took place during an inclement few nights just after Halloween in 2000. Projected faces loomed in artificial smoke. A head revolved amid the dripping, decaying leaves. A man beat his head against a tree trunk. Oursler's disembodied talking heads, projections on to the surrounding buildings, trees and billowing clouds of dry ice, tapped into the rackety histories of communications with the dead, of optics and alchemy - the blurring between science, technological research, spiritualist fervour and fakery. In one sense, The Influence Machine dealt with the history of communications, and in another with our longing to conquer both time and death: the wish to find proof of an afterlife. This \"research\" continues among internet fringe groups, who discern the traces of ghosts in the machine. The Influence Machine was also in part about the clairvoyance of modern communication systems, and how they mediate our lives. Of course, it was an absurd, spectacular theatre of a fundamentally old-fashioned kind, brought up to date by modern digital technology. So many voices, I thought, trying to get through, insisting on their perpetuity. Artists, even the most fatalistic, worry about posterity, and hope posterity will worry about them. Munoz's monument was not fixed to any temporal event. He even considered artificially ageing the stone to give it the appearance of having been permanently situated there at some indeterminate time in the past, to make the work look old. It stood, if it stood for anything, for the forgetting of the symbolism of monuments, as much as for their commemorative use; in the same way that we forget who all those bronze generals are on horseback, what battles they won, and in the name of whom - or what - they were fought. I don't know what eventually happened to Munoz's monument. I also thought that the recording of the conversation that Munoz and I had had, that day in February 1992, had disappeared too, leaving little more than the phrase, \"a beautiful futility\" hanging in the air, like the smile on the Cheshire Cat. Until, that is, the tape turned up while I was rummaging through a box of unmarked and discarded audio cassettes at home. Also among the cassettes was an almost inaudible public talk, given by whom or about what I couldn't tell. Another mystifying tape consisted only in the rustle of clothing, footsteps, wind in the microphone. Finally I came across a recording, from 1993, of a group of Bulgarian singers, the Bistritsa Babi, chanting to the North Sea. This peculiar, plaintive, dissonant chorus, transposed from eastern European hillsides to the north-east coast of England, was already out of place and out of time before it had got lost among these old tapes. Bethan Huws, with the help of Artangel, brought the singers to England and had them face the empty coastal horizon and sing. The room filled with voices, the singers bringing with them their own sense of displacement, in time as well as space. Listening again to the Bistritsa Babi, I was aware of the music occupying time: not the time it took to listen, or the intervening years since the music was recorded, not clock-time or the time-line of either recent history or the much longer history of the form of this particular vernacular, folkloric music itself, but time as something palpable but slippery and ungraspable - like that wind in that microphone, or like water, or something like the volume of the emptiness that surrounded and threatened to engulf the singers where they sang, that day in 1993. Like the cards in Munoz's invisible hand - palmed, dropped, slipped up the sleeve and shuffled to the bottom of the pack - time by turns revealed itself, hid, concertinaed. It slid off in several directions at once. Somewhere, parts of my own life went with it. Is it possible to think about time and not think about death, and everything that has already been lost? It is impossible to pass the flat stretch of municipal grass on the corner of Grove Road and Roman Road in London's East End and not notice the place where Rachel Whiteread's House once stood, and to be led back, not to House itself, but to the real house that once occupied the spot. It was a house I once entered, standing among the steel joists that temporarily held up the ceiling while Whiteread and a bunch of hard-hats went about their work. I felt like Jonah in the whale. One of the things that was said about House, when the dispute with the local council about whether it should stay was at its height, was that, finally, House should exist as a memory, and that this was - paradoxically - the condition the work aspired to. This was its ontological destiny, not just as an art-historical curiosity (a dubious fate in any case) but also in relation to the demolished dwelling whose space it occupied. Its disappearance was a signal to its condition, as sculpture and as metaphor, as had been its appearance in the place of a terraced house in the middle of a demolished row. If House was itself a representation - and one might easily get side-tracked by such questions - one might ask whether it still exists, among the other representations, descriptions and images of itself that have been archived, and among the snapshots and memories of those who saw it. Perhaps it is more a case of where House is now. The patch of grass where it stood bears the imprint of something razed, and even now, turning that corner, there is too much light on that side of the street. At the bottom of a 30m-deep shaft, 734 horizontal yards (notice the change, from the metric vertical to the imperial horizontal) from Holborn tube station, is another world. In 1999 John Berger and Simon McBurney designated the abandoned Aldwych station, on a closed Piccadilly Line spur, as being 80km west of the Nile and somewhere inside a cave in a gorge of the river Ardèche in France. It's a century or so after the death of Christ, and we are among the Egypto-Roman painters of Fayum; but we are also with the 32,000-year-old painters of the Chauvet caves. How can we say that we are with the long-dead? Perhaps it is more that they are with us. The time is also our own time, the time we bring with us - stories accumulated like soil and the riverine strata over our heads. Berger asked why it was that the portraits of the Fayum look - to paraphrase - for ever young, while those by Rubens or even Giacometti look old. \"Paintings by Rubens,\" he said, \"look old because they were painted for posterity\". In the Fayum, \"something different happened\". That something different was that the painter \"submitted to being looked at\" by his client, while the sitter looked back at the jobbing portraitist as \"death's painter\", a painter of passport portraits for the Kingdom of the Dead. The freshness and vitality of those encaustic portraits is for us at odds with their intended place and symbolic purpose - to accompany the dead, entombed sitter into the dark: into the dark, never seen, hidden. And so it is for those pigment bison, bears, mammoths and oxen painted on to the limestone walls of the caves in the Ardèche whose indisputable liveliness was hidden for so long, discovered then hidden again to preserve their existence. Our passage down the 122 spiral steps to the bottom of The Vertical Line buries us, but disinters the spectre of these images. Artist Tatsuo Miyajima has said, \"We do not need to understand time, although we think that we do. But we are living it.\" Living it, we know it will end. Life without a horizon would be intolerable, even if we never know quite how distant that horizon might be. Was this also what the Bistritsa Babi were singing to? And in the little death of each illuminated sequence of digits counting down from nine to one, over and again, the numbers sweeping across the darkened floor of Inigo Jones's Queen's House at Greenwich on the Meridian line in Miyajima's Running Time installation, was it this distance they were counting? They too had a beautiful futility, in a clock room all their own. · A longer version of this article appears in Offlimits: 40 Artangel Projects, published by Merrell at £39.95.

The flare-up began with allegations that thousands of dollars in charitable gifts from princess Haifa bint Faisal - wife of the Saudi ambassador in Washington - had found their way to friends of two of the September 11 hijackers. Although there is no evidence that the princess knew where the money had gone, Riyadh views the affair as part of a campaign led by American neo-conservatives to implicate prominent Saudis in the financing of al-Qaida. An attempt at a placatory statement by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer - that \"Saudi Arabia is a good partner in the war against terrorism but can do more\" - only fuelled the Saudi anger. Accusing the White House of becoming caught up in an \"hysterical media-frenzy\", and pandering \"to congressional primadonnas in a most disgraceful way\", the Jeddah-based Arab News said Mr Fleischer's veiled attack had opened a breach between the two countries that would be difficult to close. \"Who does it [Washington] think it is to administer such a slap in the face or make such imperious demands?\" the paper asked. \"Are we Iraq? Are we the Afghanistan of the Taliban? We are a close ally of the US.\" Other Saudi papers joined the fray. In language that could not have been used without official blessing, al-Watan accused the US of trying to blackmail the kingdom. A report in the Washington Post on Tuesday, citing an unnamed American official, said the US would ask the Saudis to act on intelligence about terrorist financing - with the threat of an ultimatum if they failed to do so. \"We tell them the problem and leave it to them to solve, presuming they will act in good faith. But if they do not act in 90 days, we assume solving the problem is beyond their ken and the United States will solve it,\" the official was quoted as saying. Secretary of state Colin Powell said later there was no substance in reports of an ultimatum. But the US does have a list of wealthy individuals - mostly Saudis - who it believes are financing al-Qaida and it is seeking to freeze their assets. A number of wealthy and prominent Saudis are also the target of a $600bn (£400bn) compensation claim brought by families of the September 11 victims. Among those named in the lawsuit - which alleges that they helped to fund the al-Qaida network - is Prince Turki al-Faisal, nominated last month as the kingdom's new ambassador in London. Another American lawsuit arises from a congressional investigation into child abductions which alleges that children with US citizenship have been taken to Saudi Arabia against their will. The House Committee on Government Reform is seeking to subpoena documents over the allegations from Qorvis Communications, a public relations company, and two other firms contracted to the Saudi government. A statement issued by the committee said: \"Criminal conduct, in some cases aided and abetted by the Saudi Embassy, is at the heart of this investigation.\" Although Osama bin Laden has some popular support in Saudi Arabia, many Saudis dismiss as ridiculous the idea that members of the royal family would willingly provide al-Qaida with funds - the overthrow of the monarchy was one of Bin Laden's original aims. Unexpected support for the princess came from Saad al-Fagih of the London-based Saudi opposition group, the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia. \"I'm sure the royal family - especially Princess Haifa and Prince Bandar [her husband] - are not at all involved in any of this business,\" he said. \"The royal family are much more keen to destroy Bin Laden than the Americans and are more than motivated in their hostility to al-Qaida.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2002/nov/28/correctionsandclarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-28T02:09:30Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/nov/28/correctionsandclarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2002/nov/28/correctionsandclarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was not correct to say, as we did in a report headed BNP snatches council seat etc, page 7, November 23, that in the 1970s \"the National Front had three councillors in Blackburn\". In May 1976 two councillors were elected to Blackburn borough council from the National party of the United Kingdom, a short-lived party that had earlier split from the National Front. One councillor remained a councillor for his three-year term. The other was found, after election, to have been ineligible to stand because of a criminal conviction. The National party failed to hold this seat in the consequential byelection, held in September 1976. We appeared to give conflicting figures for the cost of clearing up after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. In a leader, page 21, November 20, we said that the cost was £1.2bn.

American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who endowed $10m from his eponymous British trust in 1913, helped fund many of the libraries still standing today. Almost a century on, the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust continues to be one of the most progressive independent grant-making foundations. It has campaigned to make arts venues more accessible to people with disabilities and to see opportunities extended to older people, through its \"third age\" programme. And it is trying to encourage decision-makers to involve young people in public policy. Some 9,000 foundations have been set up by wealthy individuals or their families to provide a tax-sheltered mechanism for distributing money to causes in which they have an interest. But many of them are more concerned with relieving poverty, funding medical research, or supporting opera than with challenging convention. According to the Association of Charitable Foundations (ACF), endowed foundations give about £2bn in grants each year to charities - including universities and religious organisations. About 70% of this goes to health and social welfare and 30% goes to arts and recreation. Although the government outspends them by about 100 to one in social welfare and health, foundations are viewed by the voluntary sector as a vital source of income. Yet at a time when the sector is coming under increasing scrutiny to become more transparent and efficient, they have remained largely hidden from the public gaze. A report out this week hopes to change that by opening up a dialogue about the future of philanthropy. From Charity to Creativity, published by the (non-charitable) Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, says that the role of endowed charitable foundations has hardly changed in the past 200 years, and calls for them to adopt a new vision for the 21st century. The report's authors, Helmut Anheier, centennial professor at London School of Economics, and Diana Leat, visiting fellow at the school's centre for civil society, argue that foundations must do more than merely filling gaps in statutory funding. They advocate using grants to advance social change by getting people to think differently about problems and their solutions. \"Foundations should provide a space for alternative thinking, voices and practices,\" the authors say. \"Only foundations - not driven by customer, public fundraising and constituency demands - have the freedom to fulfil this role.\" Foundations are often accused of stuffing their boards with upper-class do-gooders. This perception may not sit well in a largely meritocratic society, but the report says this lack of democracy is a strength that foundations should play to. It is \"a virtue and source of their freedom to innovate or support innovation for the common good\". Protecting dissent and civil liberties, promoting pluralism, giving a voice to people excluded from policy, and curbing the dominance of government are just some of the roles on the authors' wish list. \"Much of what endowed foundations currently do could also be done, and at least equally well, by corporate foundations, community and government-initiated foundations and other voluntary organisations - even public agencies and businesses,\" they argue. \"Endowed foundations should therefore concentrate on doing those things only they have the potential to do better than other institutions.\" John Naylor, director of the Carnegie trust, agrees. \"When government is seeing charities increasingly as deliverers of public service, it is important to have an independent source of funds,\" he says. With the current downturn in the stock market, low interest rates and the loss of advance corporation tax relief all threatening to take millions of pounds from the foundations' pot, Naylor believes they have an even greater responsibility to focus limited resources on innovation. \"On the whole, that is not happening,\" he says. \"Most are just giving out money and feeling good about it.\" The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation's \"rethinking crime and punishment\" programme, which aims to raise the level of public debate about the use of prison and alternative forms of punishment, is an example of the type of radical grant-making the report wants to see. The programme's centrepiece is a £3m fund to support a range of projects to increase public understanding of, and involvement in, the criminal justice system. The Nuffield Foundation's \"access to justice\" programme and Barrow Cadbury's asylum, immigration and resettlement programmes are other examples. According to recent estimates, however, only 3% of foundation grants fund law and advocacy and civil society projects. And initial research by the Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations (Cemvo) into grant giving by the 20 largest foundations indicates that just 2% goes to black and minority ethnic (BME) groups. Cemvo says this presents a disturbing picture. It believes that many foundations are keen to support more BME causes, but have a lack of understanding about their project ideas. Cemvo is running a series of funding surgeries to bring together major charitable trusts and the black community. From Charity to Creativity argues that foundations will never fund a diverse range of causes until their boards are more representative of society. It suggests that foundations should invite trustees to join for time-limited periods - a path now followed by Carnegie. \"The benefit is that you get a set of talent you would not have have thought of,\" says Naylor. \"But it was hard work getting the trustees to accept this was the best way forward.\" Nigel Siederer, former ACF chief executive, challenges Anheier and Leat's claim that unless foundations develop a more radical edge, they will forfeit their right to tax benefits and face questions from the public about their accountability and legitimacy. \"Lots of foundations do try and effect social change, but it's not obligatory,\" Siederer says. \"Their motivations vary greatly according to their origins. Lots of what may be described as 'dull' grant-making is gratefully received by charities.\" The ACF insists that many larger foundations have already carved out a niche as innovators. But it is willing to explore some of the issues raised in the report.\"We look forward to working with the authors to clarify what exactly they mean by the 'creative' foundation,\" says Bernie Morgan, acting chief executive. Others in the foundation world are also critical of the report. \"One of the great joys and evils of charitable foundations is their lack of conformity,\" says a director of one of the biggest foundations, who does not wish to be identified. \"They must be able to maintain diversity even if bits look self-indulgent or bloody-minded. The real issue is the unwillingness by mainstream funders to absorb projects pioneered by foundations.\" Luke FitzHerbert, author of A Guide to the Major Trusts, has been tracking grant-making trusts for 17 years. \"There is numbingly little variety between most of them,\" he says. \"They behave in copycat fashion, following the conventional wisdom of the day. Most do this dreadful three-year project funding, instead of helping organisations to find alternative sources of income to help them become sustainable in the long term.\" His biggest gripe is about London bias. While the capital receives £30 for each resident from independent grant-makers, less than £5 a head goes to Northern Ireland, West Midlands, Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside and the north-east. Although FitzHerbert welcomes today's report, he says the authors cannot have it both ways. \"You can't say foundations' independence is their strength and then say you want them to do this and that,\" he argues. \"They have to be free to be boring and conventional.\" · From Charity to Creativity: philanthropic foundations in the 21st century is available at £12.99 including p&amp;p on 0123-9891431. The new philanthropists A new breed of charitable foundation is emerging from the City, bringing the culture and language of venture capital to philanthropy. Ark (Absolute Return for Kids) and Shine (Support and Help in Education), both set up by \"hedge fund\" managers -who make higher risk investments than the traditional City broker - focus on value for money and making a proven impact. Ark trustee Jennifer Moses, former manager director of investment at Goldman Sachs, says: \"The grants feel more like private investments. Recipients have to define what success is and they only continue to receive funding if they can show they are achieving what they want to accomplish.\" Ark has committed £3.5m over the next three years to charities tackling child deprivation in Britain and eastern Europe. Like Shine - which has given grants totalling £1.5m to improve the education of more than 2,000 children at almost 100 schools - most of the foundation's money is raised at an annual dinner for the \"alternative investment industry\" and all running costs are met by the trustees. Shine has also built up a £2.5m endowment. Neither foundation has a political agenda. Gavin Boyle, fund manager and Shine chairman, says he would like projects to be taken up by statutory funders. But he is wary of talking about politics. \"We hope the results speak for themselves,\" he says. \"Once the projects have shown that truancy is down and literacy is up, the local education authorities should see that it's cheaper to give money to a Saturday school than employing four extra policemen to patrol an estate.\" In contrast, the Rausing family is injecting an international focus into British grantmaking. Established with fortunes derived from the family's Tetra Pak packing company, the Ruben and Elisabeth Rausing Trust spent £3.4m last year on international human rights organisations and £1.8m on projects supporting women. Earlier this year, the separate and newly registered Lisbet Rausing Charitable Fund made its first grant, a £20m donation to enable the School of Oriental and African Studies in London to record disappearing languages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2002/nov/26/sport.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-26T22:35:36Z","webTitle":"In an £11m puff of smoke Sergei Rebrov disappeared","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/nov/26/sport.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2002/nov/26/sport.comment","fields":{"headline":"In an £11m puff of smoke Sergei Rebrov disappeared","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is a conjuring trick to make a chief executive weep. Football has no trouble making £11m disappear. Tottenham Hotspur presumably had much more labour in dragging that sum out of their coffers when they bought Sergei Rebrov from Dynamo Kiev in the summer of 2000. Now, however, it is impossible to put a value on a man who has disappeared professionally. Before he came to London, he had scored 19 goals in 35 appearances for the Ukrainian club in the Champions League and that was not even the basis of his fame. Rebrov was better known as the strategist who understod how to unleash Andrei Shevchenko. Any Spurs fan who asks whether he could also release Robbie Keane realises that there will never be any answer. Only the most devoted of fans could have nipped over to Belfast to witness his single appearance in the United Kingdom this season, during the 0-0 draw with Northern Ireland. There has been no work for him at Spurs since he filled a seat on the substitutes' bench on a couple of occasions in August. It is too late now for any rousing tale of vindication at White Hart Lane. The impression seems to be of a disheartened player. His departure will bring his employers no joy. With disuse, Rebrov has had lots of free time to watch his value collapse. His preference would be to remain in England or, at least, western Europe, but the interest shown in him so far is thought to have come from his old club in the Ukraine and from Spartak Moscow. Spurs cannot grow fat on the proceeds from such sources. The forward is falling into a long-established category of miscast foreigners adrift in English football. Alberto Tarantini will always be regarded as the doyen of such misfits. While Spurs, gloriously, upgraded themselves with the signing of Ossie Ardiles from the ranks of the 1978 World Cup winners, Birmingham City plumped for Tarantini, the Argentina full-back. The only memorable incident concerning him in this country saw Brian Greenhoff stretched out on the turf. \"I think maybe he was tired,\" Tarantini said when asked for an explanation. His bid to evade blame was the only football art form he practised during his stint in these parts. It is an immutable law that the size of the gamble increases in proportion to the distance from which a player is summoned. There was awe when Kazimierz Deyna, the great Poland midfielder of the 1970s was brought to Manchester City, but his influence was never felt to anything like its true extent at Maine Road. There is no great mystery about the disappointments. It sometimes appears that English players, with their ill-judged and short-lived periods at overseas clubs, exist to show how difficult it is to enter a foreign culture and how great the disorientation will be on the pitch when a man is not at ease. Rebrov promised to be. He already had good English before he came to Spurs and the radio ham never anticpated that there would only be static in his ears rather than applause when he began to tune himself into the Premiership. He may be due blame, but he is also a victim of circumstances. Rebrov was signed by George Graham, after prodigious efforts to close the deal by David Pleat, the director of football. Despite the lengths that Spurs went to, a change of manager wipes away all previous plans and opinions. After replacing Graham, Glenn Hoddle gradually formed his own view on the matter and the preference for Teddy Sheringham, as the deep-lying forward in the team, is obvious. There has been disgruntled mumbling about the veteran's difficulties in locating a way into some games this season, but that has never had any effect on Hoddle. Steffen Iversen and Les Ferdinand have far better prospect s than Rebrov of filling a role at White Hart Lane. There is no indignation from fans either that a presumed star has no part in the drama. They accept that each manager is allowed his preferences, even if the club's investment vanishes in the process, and Hoddle has definitely been good for Spurs. Even so, it is incredible in these cost-cutting days that football clubs can be so off-hand about the millions that gush out of their bank account. The sport is considered a random, unpredictable affair in which heavy losses must be shrugged off as a freak of nature, like a shipwreck. In no other industry are assets so casually allowed to depreciate. Rebrov, at 28, must surely re-establish his worth somewhere, but Spurs will not be getting their money back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2002/nov/26/highereducation.students2","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-26T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"Colin Lucas statement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/nov/26/highereducation.students2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2002/nov/26/highereducation.students2","fields":{"headline":"Colin Lucas statement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The prime minister, the secretary of state for education, and the minister of state with responsibility for higher education have all acknowledged publicly over the last few weeks that the funding of higher education is in a critical condition. The Transparency Review demonstrated that under-funding stands at about £1bn annually. All publicly funded activities in teaching and research in universities are paid for at below cost. Different universities have different mixes of activity and so are affected in different ways by this situation. However, this is a problem throughout universities, not just in a few of them or in a particular part of the sector. If I limit myself here to the issue of the public funding of teaching, the current situation is clearly the result of the long decline of the unit of resource (the amount paid per head of student) in the block T-grant to universities. This declined by 38% between 1988 and 2000 after a previous decline of 20% since the mid-70s. In the meantime, universities have increased the numbers of students and absorbed the contracting resource by efficiencies and reductions (including a slow-down in pay for academics and support staff relative to both the private and the public sector). In other words, productivity has increased. In the area of teaching, as in others, the under-funding is now critical. At Oxford, our most recent return to the Transparency Review (2001) reports a verified shortfall of £23.3m for the publicly funded teaching costs that fall on the central University. The colleges also have to cross-subsidize the publicly funded teaching costs that fall to them. If this situation is not remedied, what will be the consequence? The threat is to the capacity of universities to continue to provide a first-rate learning and teaching experience delivered by excellent academic staff and supported by a robust infrastructure of libraries and accommodation. The threat is, therefore, to the quality of the student experience. This is true of all universities, although there is certainly diversity among them in mission and focus. At Oxford, for example, we offer a very challenging teaching model for the most intellectually able, based upon a favourable staff-student ratio. We believe in the necessary connection between research and teaching and we demand that those who teach are active to a high level in research. We believe in undertaking both undergraduate and postgraduate education. We believe in high-quality teaching and research across a very broad waterfront. Our benchmark is the first rank of North American universities. We must be able to continue to put excellent students and excellent academics together, attracted by the opportunity to work together and by the quality of the academic context. The funding situation points towards the relegation of universities in the quite short term, by whatever benchmark its various parts measure themselves. It is not just a matter of the attraction and productive power of significant parts of the American system. One can look, for example, at the enormous medium term potential of major Chinese universities, fuelled by extraordinary public investment. The status quo is not an option. What, then, is to be done? We can look to making efficiencies and reducing expenditure. In Oxford, we have found and will continue to seek economies. However, there is a frontier between efficiency that produces more effective activity and enforced economy that damages the integrity and health of the institution's undertaking. The latter is hardly in the interests of the academics or the students. There are increasing cases of it around the university sector. We can replace home students by overseas students, since overseas fees are fixed at a level which does cover the teaching costs. We might thus emulate LSE where over 60 per cent of the students come from outside the United Kingdom. There is a danger in over-reliance on a potentially unstable overseas supply, but that is manageable. However, this would not be in the interests of British students nor indeed of a university which, I judge, does wish to remain a great national as well as international university. We can turn to the public purse for increased allocation to the sector. Let me say at once that I do believe that higher education is a public good and that therefore it should be supported by the public purse. At the same time, it is undeniably a private good in that it delivers measurable benefit to numbers of individuals, who might be expected as a body to pay themselves back over time from higher earnings, even if they retain only 60% of those earnings. This relationship and the modalities for implementing the relationship are, of course, at the centre of the current debate. Also at the centre of that debate must lie four fundamental principles: substantial new funding must come into the sector as soon as possible-any delay will make the problem worse; universities must have the resources and freedom to attract and retain the best staff and students; there must be no financial barriers-perceived or actual-to deter students from higher education; and universities must be given long-term security of funding so that they can plan and budget effectively. It is against these crucial criteria that any proposals must be judged. First, can we expect the public purse to pay more now? I think that the realistic answer is no. There are already too many legitimate claims for additional public expenditure in areas such as health, transport, and primary and secondary education in which all taxpayers have a direct and individual interest. Furthermore, the objective of extending higher education to 50% of those between 18 and 30 by 2010 already presents an additional activity which will demand significant additional funding without addressing the issue of maintaining existing excellence within the sector generally (not just in parts of it). Can we use the public purse as a means of cycling money from individuals through to universities, that is to say a graduate tax? There are attractions to a graduate tax. It appears to answer the questions surrounding student fee payments by deferring payment by individuals until they have adequate income to support it and calibrating payment to a level that indicates the real financial benefit of university education to each individual. However, there are serious disadvantages. The lead-time for realistic income from a graduate tax is long and therefore universities would essentially be asking for a direct increased allocation now against deferred income to the public purse. Moreover, a hypothecated tax has never remained over a long period directly connected to its object (see taxation for the roads). From the universities' point of view, there is no guarantee that the yield of the tax will pass directly through to them nor that the income will not be used as a substitute for the maintenance of other public funding and thus cease to be additional. Finally, one may expect taxpayer resistance once it is felt that the demand has become somehow unreasonable in relation to an increasingly distant cost. From a government's point of view, one hypothecated tax validates others. It therefore undermines the principle of general taxation and presages an impossible fragmentation of the tax regime. Nonetheless, a taxation procedure might form one element of a combined solution, if a formula consistent with the principles I have outlined could be found. What about an extension of self-paying fees? From the point of view of universities, the advantage of fees is that they contribute towards an under-funded cost of delivery of education at the point of delivery. The central problem is whether an extension of fees will deter those capable of university study from aspiring to do so or actually prevent them from entering the university of their choice. In other words, if there are fees, how should one continue to protect access? It must be said first that the figures bandied around the press (£10,000, £15,000, £20,000) are quite unrealistic. If there is to be an extension of self-paying fees, the assumption must be that the funding council will continue to pay the block T-grant at its current value. In that case, universities do not need those sums; students should not expect to pay them. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect there to be a cap on any extension of the self-paying fee level. Second, this university has stated several times in recent years its attachment to the principle that no-one who has the talent and the appropriate qualifications to enter it shall be prevented from doing so by consideration of costs. There is no reason to suppose that Oxford would modify that position. It would undo all the work that we have put in to attract more candidates from a broad variety of backgrounds and the bursary scheme that the colleges and the University have introduced in that context. Indeed, it is clear that there must be financial aid in the form of bursaries or types of remission. How this is to be funded across universities needs careful exploration, but a part of it at least is likely to come from within the fee income itself. If the question is that the mere existence of fees will deter people, then it is up to universities and the government to campaign for a better understanding. If the proposition is that universities ought to be free, then the conversation is difficult to engage. Parliament can decide that the public return on universities is such that the individual return can be ignored or deemed reflected in higher tax (though not all higher taxpayers are graduates and not all graduates are higher taxpayers or spend a significant part of their earning life as such). For England, parliament has already taken a decision that there shall be individual contributions. Indeed, provided that appropriate safeguards can be found, there is no reason for fees to be a substantial deterrent. The most difficult issue is to identify those people who cannot pay. This is complicated because it is not simply a matter of parental income but of a range of personal circumstances including the number of family members at university. It is certainly difficult to devise a sensitive sector-wide mechanism, but difficulty should not prevent addressing the issue. In reality, there is a strong argument for saying that the rise of student debt derives from the abolition of student maintenance grants rather than from fees which, outside individual inaccuracies of assessment, do not by and large bear heavily on those unable to pay. It is clear that the white paper needs to address the issue of student finance. In sum, I do not think that it is right to dismiss an extension of student fees out of hand. It is wiser to explore how those who can afford to pay do so to a reasonable degree without damaging those who cannot. One can think of numbers of combinations, such as a premium of up-front payment against a more expensive option of deferred payment, or some form of time-limited charge on national insurance related to maintenance support, or other ideas that will occur to others. It is unrealistic not to explore the possibilities. It may be that nothing can be found that everyone will agree is entirely fair to all. However, we must find a way of putting the funding back into our universities that will ensure that in future student experience is of the quality that those students rightly deserve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2002/nov/26/uk.iraq","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-26T02:40:17Z","webTitle":"Iraq war plans on course as Labour MPs rebel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/26/uk.iraq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/nov/26/uk.iraq","fields":{"headline":"Iraq war plans on course as Labour MPs rebel","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Britain's main battle tank, the Challenger 2, will be ready in time for a military attack against Iraq, the government announced last night hours after the first team of UN weapons inspectors arrived in Baghdad. As 32 Labour MPs voted against the government's Iraq policy - a larger than expected rebellion -the defence secretary Geoff Hoon outlined a series of preparations for a possible military strike. The Challenger 2, which ran into trouble during the recent Saif Sareea exercise in Oman because its sand filters didn't function adequately, is being \"desertised\". Asked about reports that the Ministry of Defence has failed to make preparations to improve the tank, Mr Hoon told MPs: \"United Kingdom forces will be fully prepared in good time for any future operations. I can assure [the House] that the equipment will perform as necessary in those conditions.\" Other preparations for a possible military attack include: · Enhancing medical support to improve hygiene conditions in field hospitals; · Speeding up the purchase of temporary disposable accommodation; · Improving military ambulances; · Increase forces' training in secure communications; · Starting exploratory work to assess how many reservists may be needed in the event of an attack. Mr Hoon made his announcement minutes before 32 Labour MPs defied a three-line whip to vote in favour of a Liberal Democrat amendment which would have blocked any military action against Iraq unless it was approved by the UN security council and the House of Commons. Although a larger number of Labour MPs - 53 - rebelled in the vote in September, last night's vote was seen as a bigger blow to the government because a UN security council resolution has since passed unanimously. The rebellion came as Tony Blair and Jack Straw appeared to put out conflicting signals on Iraq. The prime minister attempted to step up pressure on Saddam Hussein by warning that he risked a military attack if he issues a \"dishonest\" declaration of his weapons of mass destruction to the UN on December 8. The prime minister warned that such a declaration would amount to a \"material breach\" of the resolution. Within hours of Mr Blair's remarks, however, Mr Straw announced that Britain would show patience if President Saddam failed to declare all his weapons by the deadline. Speaking at the start of the Commons debate, the foreign secretary indicated to MPs that a failure by Iraq to declare all its weapons of mass destruction would not constitute a material breach of the security council resolution. A \"false statement or omission in the Iraqi declaration\" would have to be accompanied by a \"failure to comply with the resolutions or to cooperate with the inspectors\" for action to be taken. Mr Blair's remarks appeared to be closer to a warning last week by George Bush, who signalled a readiness to launch an invasion if he is unconvinced by Iraq's declaration next month. \"Should he again deny that this arsenal exists, he will have entered his final stage with a lie, and deception this time will not be tolerated,\" the US president said at the Nato summit in Prague. Downing Street will play down any differences between Mr Blair and Mr Straw. They will point out that Mr Blair made his remarks in response to a question about what would happen if Iraq denied that it had any weapons of mass destruction at all. Mr Straw appeared to be talking about what would happen if there were omissions by Iraq. Mr Straw adopted a different tone from the US on another front when he declared that Britain would like to secure a second UN security council resolution before launching military action against Iraq. However, the foreign secretary made clear that Britain reserved the right to bypass the UN if other members of the security council refused to endorse action. US administration officials have refused to give a defini tive answer on Washington's intended reaction after December 8. But they pointed to the ambiguity in Mr Bush's warning that President Saddam will have \"entered his final phase\", which suggests the response might not be immediate. \"However, a bogus declaration will be a clear sign of Saddam's intentions not to cooperate,\" one official said. British sources privately say that the Bush administration has assured the Blair government that the US will not go to war solely on the grounds of omissions or deceptions in the December 8 statement. They portray the differences in rhetoric between the US and Britain as a matter of presentation rather than substance. However, there are signs that the debate within the US administration over policy towards Baghdad is likely to erupt again after December 8. The chief hawks in the Bush team are expected to seize on a questionable declaration to push for rapid military action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2002/nov/26/furthereducation.uk6","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-26T02:33:53Z","webTitle":"The big leap....

Have you any experience? Have you done any training? I haven't, I'm afraid. I've had a rather busy career to date in teaching. All good experience. The majority of people who enter counselling training are aged over 40, often graduates, with much life and work experience. Many have had careers in social work, careers guidance, the Church, teaching, youth and community work, nursing and medicine. So I'm not too old? Actually it is unusual for someone to do full-time counselling before their mid-twenties. What broadly would I be doing? You would generally be dealing with people going through some sort of crisis. You would help your client talk about their problems, listening carefully to what they have to say and probing deeper. You may help them to see problems from a different perspective and come to a solution. What sorts of problems? You could be dealing with a very wide range - helping the bereaved, or someone with an alcohol problem, for instance. They are very different situations. Yes, and should you wish to specialise in a particular type, that's possible - for example relationship difficulties, Aids, drug abuse, or with particular age groups - teenagers, for example. What qualifications would I need? Counselling is not a fully established or regulated profession. There are no legal qualifications. Many practitioners register voluntarily with one of the main counselling and psychotherapy organisations, and work within their ethical framework, but there are countless unregistered therapists. Psychotherapy - that's a different thing entirely, isn't it? There are similarities, but the two tend to work in different settings and follow different training. Counsellors tend to cater for relatively less disturbed people. What skills are required? You need to be able to establish a trusting relationship with another person, gain their respect, put them at their ease and pay attention to them. And specific counselling skills? These would include clarifying a problem, responding, active listening... What's that? Well, problem-solving, goal-setting, helping your client take action and, where necessary, challenging what they say. But you must also remain non-judgmental, and accept a client's problems without being burdened by them. What training would you recommend? There is a very wide variety of courses available, from introductory workshops to postgraduate courses. The more substantial courses often require relevant experience of counselling or helping and will look closely at your personal qualities, maturity and experience. What job opportunities are there? There is part-time or voluntary work with a range of organisations, such as Alcohol Concern, the Samaritans, Relate (relationship counselling), Cruse (bereavement counselling), and Mind (mental health). Full-time jobs are available in schools, colleges, organisations for people with disabilities, youth work, in the health service and agencies connected with alcohol, drugs and Aids. Others work in large companies, which is a growing area.

I thought that \"children and families social work\" sounded really wholesome. I had this idea that I would be joining a well resourced, cheerful and optimistic team of colleagues who had the time and inclination to develop positive therapeutic relationships with their clients. I had absolutely no idea of the reality of children and families social work in Britain in the early 90s. I also had no idea that \"children and families\" was effectively a euphemism for child protection. And sometimes I wonder who has any idea of the reality of child protection now, in the 21st century. After five years of plugging away at being a children and families social worker, I finally realised that I could no longer bear the huge impact that this work was having on me. My tough-but-empathic exterior had worn away to a thin, brittle layer that no longer protected me from the trauma, the filthy homes and housing estates, and the terrible sadness that seemed to have become the sum of my work. I wonder how many other social workers have had a similar experience. I suppose most British social workers will have had the advantage of knowing that children and families social work is all about child protection. But how many will have had any idea that not only will they have to do their job whilst fending off criticism from all sides, but also will have to spend huge amounts of emotional energy protecting their \"personal self\" from their professional experiences? After a healthy break of four years, I came back to social work - and back to child protection as a frontline social worker and as a researcher. I was commissioned by the Metropolitan Police to survey the state of area child protection committee (ACPC) procedures and guidelines across all the London boroughs. The findings from this research have contributed to the development of the forthcoming pan-London child protection procedures. In this unique position as both participant and observer, I began to see things a little differently. The research showed that there are significant differences between many of the procedures and guidelines across London, and I wondered whether these \"differences\" were being maintained, reinforced and perhaps even protected by senior managers. I became aware that since the implementation of the Children Act over a decade ago a number of these local authorities had struck out on their own path in the evolution of child protection practice and appeared to be less interested in joining the movement towards developing national standards of practice. Grassroots collaboration But perhaps the most concerning finding from this research was that the fundamental principle of professionals working in partnership with each other to protect children had not been wholeheartedly implemented across London. I am fairly sure that most social workers, health visitors, police officers and other colleagues working in child protection do their very best to work effectively in partnership with each other - to safeguard vulnerable children. I am less sure whether and how those efforts are encouraged and enabled by their empire-protecting senior managers. In the process of reviewing child protection policies and guidelines, I realised how difficult things can be for child protection professionals. A significant number of these people across the country are being expected to run key child protection services, taking into account new developments in good practice, with unforgivably poor and out of date policies and guidance. Some social workers - including those who are newly qualified and inexperienced - are sometimes expected to work from child protection policy documents that haven't changed in the decade since the Children Act took effect. It is now known from various inquiries into the deaths of children that amongst other things it's not just the existence and quality of policies and guidelines that may have made a difference. It has been shown that in some instances the professionals on these cases have not been trained in the use of these policies and guidelines. In some cases, they've had no access to these documents, and have also not had professional supervision that has enabled them to link the policies and guidelines with their practice. I am concerned that some area child protection committees may have been ticking the relevant boxes to show that they have all the right things in place, whereas the reality is that frontline workers are ill equipped in a practical manner to protect children really effectively. You might remember that in the late 1980s and early 1990s there were a number of \"scandals\" that hit the press involving unqualified or untrained social workers on serious child protection cases. Aside from alerting professionals and public alike to some of the horrifying truths of child protection cases, these \"scandals\" forced employing authorities to recognise the dangerousness of allocating complex child protection cases to unskilled and unsupported workers. Things started to change in 1991 - I remember many social work colleagues being sponsored by their employers to study for their social work qualifications and there began a dramatic shift towards professionalising social work, and particularly child protection work. But in the past two or three years there has been a massive haemorrhage of workers from child protection. Rise of agency workers Not only are workers leaving this specialism, they are also not being attracted to this work. You need only look at the job section in the Guardian on a Wednesday to see that a significant proportion of the social work posts that are advertised are for permanent posts in child protection (or children and families work). Turn a few more pages and you'll see dozens of adverts for recruitment agencies offering immediate short- and long-term placements to social workers willing to work in child protection. Since the haemorrhage of workers out of child protection began, recruitment agencies have become a necessary part of child protection social work. Social workers who join these agencies may not have the benefit of local authority pensions or job security, but what they do have is the freedom to move in and out of jobs quickly and easily and are usually paid a lot more than permanent staff. As an agency social worker it is possible to find work in a variety of settings, although placements in child protection and residential homes for children and young adults are most common. Agency workers usually stay in posts for a few months, which makes continuity with children and their families very difficult - if not impossible. This frequent staff upheaval entailed by the increasing dependence on agency social workers in some authorities almost certainly means that the quality of those child protection services is not as good as it should be. I did a quick straw poll in the past few days of friends and colleagues who work around the country, and they tell me that there are often as many agency social workers as there are permanent social workers in child protection; some teams have a majority of agency staff. I am also reliably told that there aren't as many social work graduates returning to children and families teams for permanent posts after their student placements there. And when new graduates do come in to children and families work they're often induced - by the prospect of more money, less stress and more reliable hours - to sign on with the agencies, or move on to other social work fields such as fostering and adoption, or children with disabilities. Of course the net result of all of this is that there are fewer people to do the work and local authorities are under even greater pressure to find workers to fill posts. In some areas they are \"growing\" their own trainees by offering social work assistant-type posts to psychology and sociology undergraduates. In over-stretched and under-staffed children and families teams, these trainees are sometimes placed in the appalling situation of having to take lead responsibility for serious and complex child protection cases because there is no one else. Working jointly on such cases is a key part of their learning, but they cannot replace the expertise of qualified and skilled workers. In a similar vein, I heard recently from a colleague who works in child protection in one of the Home Counties about the senior management response to staff shortages. After inducting four new social workers to the team and realising that for one reason or another each person was unsuitable for child protection work, he was told by a senior manager \"Well, you said you wanted more staff, what are you complaining about.\" It seems to me that this \"be grateful for what you get\" attitude has the potential to become the motto that protection teams come to live by. Social work education is about to change dramatically from the present diploma course to a university degree that I think is likely to result in fewer social workers qualifying each year. My guess is that the entry requirements for a degree course are likely to be higher than those for the present diploma. The new degree course will be more academic, there will be a greater emphasis on exams, essays and dissertations and a leaning towards underpinning core skills training with a complex theoretical base. In addition, there will be greater pressure on students to marry the development of their practical skills with research and theory. I'm greatly encouraged by this bold step to improve the profession from its roots as a vocation rather than a profession, but where there is already a dearth of people joining the profession, I am wondering how the number of trainees will be increased, not decreased, as a result of these changes. I've heard rumours from some of those currently responsible for social work training, that to begin with the entry requirements (and presumably also the quality of training, exams, and so on) are likely to be downgraded, so as to make sure that that those who apply are accepted on to the initial courses, and pass each year, because the shortage of qualified social workers is so dire. So if they weren't already reluctant to join a demanding and undervalued profession, will there be enough new recruits to the profession who will be willing and able to weather the political and professional storms ahead of them? The field of child protection is a challenging and stimulating area to be working in right now. The wide-ranging changes to child protection that are in the pipeline mean that there's the opportunity to do things better, to evaluate everything that has been achieved to date, and to build on the achievements of the past. It would be easy to be very British-ly self-deprecating and undermine the unnoticed work that is done every day, preventing children from being abused and harmed. So my hope is that whatever changes are made in the name of improving the welfare and protection of children also take into account that skilled, knowledgeable, motivated and well resourced staff are the hinge on which all other positive changes depend. - Mary Jacob is a qualified social worker with seven years' experience in child protection social work.

Instead, by the time the Great Britons contest finally ended last night - with Winston Churchill emerging as the winner - it had been tainted by controversy, amid allegations of vote rigging. The latest accusation yesterday was that the BBC had manipulated the poll by putting Winston Churchill last in a series of 10 programmes on the top 10 Britons. This was to ensure, said the Mail on Sunday, that Churchill did not leap too far ahead in the running, making it a tighter contest and ensuring more viewers and more votes. Last night a BBC spokeswoman said it had left Churchill until last to finish on a high with a popular figure. The programme has been dogged with allegations of vote rigging. Earlier this month bookmakers stopped taking money on the contest after the attempted swamping of phone lines and internet portals by Brunel University students in favour of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A great engineer he may have been, but Isambard Kingdom Brunel's pole position in the voting - held until last week - was a surprise. The university's home page ran \"Is Brunel the Greatest Briton?\" at the top of its website and provided a link to the BBC's Great Britons site to encourage people to vote for him. A BBC spokeswoman was ambivalent about the Brunel bombardment, saying: \"Perhaps [this] would persuade science students to champion Newton or literature students Shakespeare.\" There has also been an attempt by someone, admitted the BBC, to \"dripfeed\" internet votes from computers using a \"sophisticated method\" in favour of Shakespeare, Churchill and Darwin. But the BBC dismisses any thoughts this could have been an attempt by bookies to manipulate the vote, with its spokeswoman saying it was more likely the work of computer \"nerds\", and their votes had been cancelled out. The decision to have guest presenters - such as BBC political editor Andrew Marr representing Charles Darwin - lobbying for their favourite Briton could have meant that some voting for Brunel were, in effect, voting for his lobbyist, popular Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. A BBC spokeswoman suggested last night that Brunel may have attracted so many votes because Mr Clarkson could sell ice to an igloo owner. But even if detractors claim the show has been the middle-brow equivalent of Pop Idol, its producers are happy. With more than three million people watching, and more than 1.2 million votes cast, they will feel justified in claiming it was an accurate test of public opinion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2002/nov/25/athletics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-25T00:40:14Z","webTitle":"Davies on rostrum again - as president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/nov/25/athletics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2002/nov/25/athletics","fields":{"headline":"Davies on rostrum again - as president","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Lynn Davies, the 1964 Olympic long jump champion, took another giant leap yesterday to become president of UK Athletics responsible for helping plot the best way to invest the sport's multi-million legacy. Davies beat Frank Clement, the former British 1500 metres and mile record-holder, to the position vacated by David Hemery, who stepped down at the fourth Annual Congress of Athletics in Loughborough after a maximum of four years in the post. \"I am delighted to be elected to this important position within UK Athletics at a time when I believe the sport is facing a golden opportunity to move forward,\" said Davies, 60, who secured 360 votes from clubs across the country against 258 for Clement. The role is an honorary appointment, compared with that of the decision-making chief executive's post held by David Moorcroft, but it is also a pivotal position as the sport's figurehead. Like Hemery, Davies will work closely with Moorcroft, advising and planning for the future of athletics in the United Kingdom at a time when the sport has been granted a £41m investment from the government as compensation following the breakdown of the Picketts Lock stadium proposals. Davies said: \"We have some talented young athletes moving through into the senior ranks. This factor, combined with the promise of the £41m investment in the sport, means the future looks bright. The 'legacy' investment is a great opportunity to invest in the grassroots to provide a sound base and structure to support the sport.\" After his victory in the long jump in Tokyo, Davies progressed to win the European title two years later and in 1968 he took his own British record to 8.23 metres, a mark which was beaten only last April when Chris Tomlinson leaped four centimetres further in Tallahassee in Florida. Davies, who competed for Britain 48 times and was team captain at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, is a senior lecturer at the University of Wales Institute in Cardiff. Moorcroft said: \"Lynn will do a great job as president. He is well known worldwide, he has great depth of experience in the sport, he cares about athletics in the way that David did and I hope he is every bit as effective. I am looking forward to working with him. \"David has always been a great personal support.

But that is pretty much that. The BBC roll-call of the top 10 greatest Britons reads: scientists, engineer, queen, princess, prime minister, playwright, regicide, musician and sea captain - eight men and two women, and not a serious pair of trainers between them. But if you think that is strange, try scanning the top 100. Are you bombarded by those sporting heros who just failed to make the final cut? Are you heck. There are just three - at No69 Bobby Moore, at No36 Sir Steve Redgrave and at No33 David Beckham. It is all a bit confusing. We are supposed to be growing ever more obese through our obsession with sport, spending the night listening to Radio 5 Live while swallowing 20-page sports supplements and keeping half a weary eye on the ball-by-ball web coverage of the Ashes. We invented and then spread sports around the world with the erudition of a nation of bread-butterers. We built the empire on polo and cricket; we invented the plucky loser. We cornered the market in \"it's not the winning - it's the taking part\". We took Eddie the Eagle to our bosom. And we continue to produce the brilliant, the Michael Vaughans and the Darren Campbells. Our history and national psyche is pepper-gunned with sport. From the breezy day in 1588 when Sir Francis Drake (No49) insisted on playing yet another end of bowls as the Armada approached, to 1913 when the suffragette Emily Davison jumped in front of the King's horse at the Derby. From the Christmas Day football match played between the British and the Germans on the front in 1914, to the fateful day when Cliff Richard first grabbed the microphone at Wimbledon. From Headingley in 1981 to English footballers missing penalties in 1990, 1996 and 1998. With such a legacy, it would have been wonderful to see Michael Portillo expounding on Elizabeth I followed by Tony Benn (No97) on Arthur Wharton or Julie Andrews (No59) on Mary Peters. But no such luck. Why? It could be that there is no longer any credible sport left on the BBC to spice up a voter's imagination. Is this why John Peel (No43) makes the top 100 but not Des Lynam? Or it could be that, when it comes to the crunch, we, or at least the 30,000 people who nominated the top 100 last year, still celebrate the cerebral over the physical. This could explain a lot - and it's always good to get your excuses in early. Can you imagine an Australian top 10 that did not include a sportsman? Preposterous, mate. Don Bradman was the greatest living Australian from about the age of 30, but now he has moved on upwards to become the greatest ever Australian, his old title is up for grabs. There is only one possible nominee - the man with flippers for feet and an otter's body: Ian Thorpe. The greatest Tasmanian? That merry moustache, David Boon. The greatest Queenslander? Rugby league's Wally Lewis. The greatest Brazilian? Pele. The greatest Indian? A heavyweight contest between Mahatma Gandhi and Sachin Tendulkar. More biographies have been written about Oliver Cromwell than any British or English monarch. By the time David Beckham retires, sometime in his early 30s, he will have shifted probably a thousand times more books than Cromwell. But however fantastic his haircut, however perfect his free-kicks, his best chance of British greatness is still the World Cup, or alternatively nomination for the BBC's sport's personality of the year award, to be won in 2002 by Paula Radcliffe, or possibly, if there is a glitch, Isembard Kingdom Brunel. Otherwise Beckham could consider becoming a Yorkshireman. Because it is inconceivable that sportsmen - in particular Geoffrey Boycott and Fred Trueman - would not make it into a tyke top 10. Their greatest rival for No1, the nation's favourite hunchback Richard III - No82 in the poll despite Will Shakespeare's smear campaign - would have his work cut out. He couldn't even keep the Lancastrians at bay, for goodness sake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2002/nov/24/observercashsection","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-24T07:27:48Z","webTitle":"Cash in a flash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/nov/24/observercashsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2002/nov/24/observercashsection","fields":{"headline":"Cash in a flash","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"No car and no holidays abroad - and they're the lucky OAPs Single pensioners need between £160 (homeowners) and £200 (tenants) a week to have a decent lifestyle during retirement, according to Age Concern's research report 'Modest but Adequate'. However, only half of older people have this much money coming in - and the situation will get worse in the future, the charity warns. With this level of income, a pensioner could spend some money on leisure activities but not much. They could, for instance, have two five-day breaks in the UK but would not be able to go abroad or run a car. Last week the Government announced a 4 per cent rise in the minimum income guarantee for pensioners, to £102.50 a week for single people and £155.80 for couples from April.

All profits from the single, which goes on sale on 9 December, will be donated to the National Canine Defence League. Car insurance that cramps style One in three car owners admit to buying a car that costs less to insure than the one they originally wanted, according to research by online bank Egg. No wonder. Car insurance premiums have increased at an average annual rate of 7.8 per cent for the past eight years. If this continues, Egg estimates the average car owner will be spending £1,446 on insurance in 2012, and £181,712 over the next 40 years - equal to the average cost of a three bedroom terraced house at today's prices. Small firms pay up to bank big Small businesses pay more than a third extra to bank with the traditional big four banks rather than one of the new entrants to the market, says Alliance &amp; Leicester Business Banking. Companies with a turnover of less than £1 million a year pay an average of £520.32 per annum for basic banking services with Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds TSB and HSBC. In contrast, small businesses that deal with alternative clearers pay £379.56 a year. More than one in eight companies claimed that banking charges are too confusing for them to estimate what they are paying. Firms in the construction sector pay the highest bank charges, an average of £54.64 a month.

Shareholders waste £30m UK Shareholders are leaving dividend cheques worth more than £30m uncashed each year, according to BACS, the bank automated clearing system. More than 300,000 shareholders also have to ask their share registrars to replace cheques that have been lost or stolen, often incurring fees for the service. To avoid these problems, BACS is advising investors to ask for dividend payments to be paid straight into their bank accounts, using the BACS Direct Credit service. Shareholders must fill in details of their bank or building society account on the form that usually accompanies the dividend cheque. Once this form has been returned to the Registrar, future dividends will be paid into the shareholder's bank account.

More than two million people fear their scheme will close and a further three million expect their benefits to be greatly reduced, according to a survey by fund management group Jupiter. Nearly one in five of those in a money purchase company pension scheme used to have access to their firm's final salary scheme.

In the shock result, BNP candidate Robin Evans, a 38-year-old builder, won a byelection in Mill Hill ward with a 16-vote majority after two recounts. The victory prompted memories of the 1970s when the National Front had three councillors in Blackburn. It also brings the BNP's national tally of seats to four. In May the party picked up three council seats in neighbouring Burnley but failed to make headway in Oldham or Bradford. Although some commentators feared the result could indicate the onward march of the BNP in the north-west of England, local politicians and community leaders were swift to play down its significance in a town where race relations have been strong in recent years and where there was no trouble on the streets during the race riots summer of 2001. They suggested that the BNP had exploited both hostility to Islam after last year's attacks on the US and the national debate about asylum seekers. \"This result will not obstruct our efforts to build a more tolerant, multi-religious community in the town,\" said Mr Straw. \"The politics of racial exclusion can have no place in British society and all mainstream parties will now have to work harder to defeat it.\" Ibrahim Master, chairman of the Lancashire council of mosques, described the result as a surprise and a shock. \"This has been a protest vote about local issues rather than a reflection on the state of race relations in Blackburn. I don't believe the BNP has any real support at grassroots level,\" he said. \"There is an element of the racist vote in Blackburn,\" said Sue Reid, the council's deputy leader. \"The BNP literature was overtly racist. But we saw them off in the 1970s and I believe we will see them off again.\" The BNP used pub meetings and leaflet campaigns to target Blackburn, where about 20% of residents are thought to be from ethnic minorities, after its Burnley victories. It also made much of a planning application - turned down by the council - to establish a hostel for asylum seekers in mainly white Mill Hill ward, scene of the election. The party hailed its success as a \"victory for common sense\" and said core values of \"decency, respect, civic pride, love of one's family and neighbours\" had won the day. Like other successful BNP candidates, Mr Evans refused to be interviewed after his win but read from a prepared statement in which he said he would not be handicapped by political correctness. He looked forward to further success in 2004 when all seats on Labour-controlled Blackburn with Darwen council will be contested because of boundary changes. The BNP exploited a similar situation in Burnley this year and their latest victory will be a wake-up call to the mainstream parties. Bill Taylor, the council's Labour leader, described the result as deeply disappointing. \"We are not going to let something like this stop us working to improve the lives of all of our people here,\" he said. The Conservative leader Colin Rigby said his party had fielded a candidate to show its \"distaste and loathing\" of all that the BNP stands for. He viewed the result with \"dismay and horror\". \"We had the early warning in Burnley and should have taken more notice of the tactics used,\" he said. David Foster, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats who were defending the seat, said: \"This is a sad day for Blackburn. The one crumb of comfort is that the majority of people in Mill Hill voted against the BNP.\" He added: \"We have made an official complaint to both the police and the returning officer about the BNP leaflet which we believe contravened election law.\" The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Thursday November 28 It was not correct to say, as we did in a report headed BNP snatches council seat etc, page 7, November 23, that in the 1970s \"the National Front had three councillors in Blackburn\". In May 1976 two councillors were elected to Blackburn borough council from the National party of the United Kingdom, a short-lived party that had earlier split from the National Front. One councillor remained a councillor for his three-year term. The other was found, after election, to have been ineligible to stand because of a criminal conviction. The National party failed to hold this seat in the consequential byelection, held in September 1976."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2002/nov/23/guardianletters","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-23T01:14:07Z","webTitle":"Letter: Isambard's kingdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/nov/23/guardianletters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2002/nov/23/guardianletters","fields":{"headline":"Isambard's kingdom","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The current recognition of IK Brunel as our \"Greatest Briton\" is indeed long overdue (What do we need from a hero?

His visionary projects delivered significant, and lasting, economic and technical benefits at a seminal stage in Britain's industrial development. The Great Western Railway was years ahead of its time and set a benchmark for infrastructure development that has seldom been surpassed. Nevertheless, contemporary British engineers are scarcely less inspirational. Recent projects such as the Falkirk Wheel, Millennium Gateshead Bridge, London Eye, Cardiff Millennium stadium and Manchester Commonwealth stadium are modern icons that exemplify the creativity of engineers in modern society. Brunel's GWR continues to provide outstanding value for money. In infrastructure, quick fixes weren't the answer in the 19th century and they aren't the answer now. Building and maintaining high-quality national infrastructure is an investment that pays dividends over time. Brunel's bequest to British society remains a truly monumental one. Through this renewed interest in Brunel, it is heartening to see the public showing such warm appreciation for the excitement of engineering.

Abul Huda was prime minister to Abdullah, ruler of the Hashemite kingdom of Transjordan. \"Glubb Pasha\" had in 1939 been appointed commander of Abdullah's \"Arab Legion\". Abul Huda and Glubb put to Bevin an interesting scenario: that as the British left Palestine, the Arab Legion would march into it in order to assure law and order. Abul Huda assured Bevin that the legion would only enter Jewish areas if the Jews invaded Arab areas. Following the meeting, the British government let it be known that as long as the Hashemite kingdom stuck to this assurance, its financial support would remain intact. And so it was. In due course the Arab Legion marched into Arab Palestine and conquered the provinces of Judea and Samaria, including the Old City of Jerusalem. Abdullah then incorporated the West Bank within his kingdom, an annexation recognised only by Britain and Pakistan. The Palestinian Arab state, sanctioned by the UN in 1947 to coexist alongside the Jewish state, was thus throttled at birth. In Zionist eyes Glubb Pasha was a public enemy. Indeed, growing up in a Jewish household, I can recall his name being uttered with scarcely less opprobrium than Hitler's. Not only had his legion beaten the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), not only had his military machine, funded by British subsidies, appeared to threaten the very existence of the re-established Jewish state. He was viewed as nothing less than a servant of the British government, the last of the great military pro-consuls foisted by the British on corrupt and despotic regimes as instruments of imperial control. Ironically, this was also how he came to be viewed by Arab nationalists. Benny Morris has done a comprehensive if somewhat laboured job in debunking these myths. During the first world war Glubb had fallen in love with the Arab world. As head of the Arab Legion he was closer to Abdullah than any other Briton. Reluctantly, he had by 1947 come round to the view that western Palestine (from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean) should be partitioned. But he feared the tub-thumping pro-Nazi nationalism of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, regarding it both as a perversion of Arab values in itself and as a threat to the feudalistic regime over which Abdullah presided in Transjordan. Abdullah's desire to conquer the West Bank had, in fact, already received the blessing of the Zionists. At a secret meeting with Golda Myerson (Meir), of the Jewish Agency, on November 17 1947, Abdullah announced his desire to \"attach\" the Arab part of Palestine to Transjordan. Myerson indicated that this would be acceptable to the Jews provided \"you don't hamper us in establishing our state\". In war, of course, matters do not always go exactly as expected. The Arab Legion's military engagements with the IDF came about, it is true, more by accident than by design. Glubb was terrified of over-committing the limited forces at his command, desperately short as they were of ammunition and of mechanised transport. IDF commanders never believed Glubb had any plan to conquer all of Jerusalem, still less to march on Tel Aviv. Morris proves this, but omits to point out sufficiently forcefully that, in the fog of war, perception invariably counts for more than reality. In his more flamboyant moments Abdullah had indeed waxed lyrical on the possibility of ruling over the whole of Palestine. The IDF was right not to take any chances. Glubb emerges from this study a capable and wise military strategist, but no Machiavelli. He lent himself to shameless exploitation by Whitehall but failed to appreciate the social and political fragility of the Hashemite regime. That regime, in turn, failed to heed his warnings about the fragility of its military hold on the West Bank. In 1956 King Hussein of Jordan ordered him out of the country. In the course of a few days, in 1967, all that he had won for the ungrateful Hashemites was thrown away. · Geoffrey Alderman is the author of Modern British Jewry (OUP)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2002/nov/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview11","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-23T00:23:16Z","webTitle":"Review: My Life in Heavy Metal by Steve Almond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/nov/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview11","fields":{"headline":"The geek's revenge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My Life in Heavy Metal by Steve Almond 231pp, Heinemann, £9.99 For a writer who \"explores the lives of young men in their 20s and 30s\", as the blurb puts it, the American author Steve Almond is remarkably good at depicting women. A shame, then, that only one of the 12 stories in this, his debut collection, is told from a female perspective. In \"Geek Player, Love Slayer\", the unnamed narrator - a 33-year-old newspaper reporter - and her male colleague Brisby identify a new species: the lifeguard of the decade, the geek player. They wonder how such people came into existence. \"Because even two years ago the Systems Manager was this little smudge of a person who frittered on about mainframe systems and was perfectly content to hang with his tech buddies.\" These days, the computer guy struts around the office \"hustling chicks\" and coming to the rescue of the \"computer fuckups\", all of whom worship the carpet he walks on. The real star here is not the resident geek player, Lance, but the narrator herself, surely the sassiest, randiest female ever to terrorise American fiction. \"O please,\" she says to Lance. \"Go ask the wizard for a brain.\" When he squeezes the bridge of her foot (while fiddling with cables under her desk), she's thinking: \"Hey, bright boy: there's a whole calf and thigh where that came from!\" Like many an overworked thirtysomething woman, she wonders why she hasn't got kids, why she hasn't got a good man. And why she has fallen for a \"smoothie from the Kingdom of Cheese\". But it isn't all hip social satire. \"My Life In Heavy Metal\" and \"Run Away, My Pale Love\" both explore ill-fated relationships. \"There is a point you reach,\" concludes the narrator of the latter, \"when you are just something bad that happened to someone else.\" If you found that sentence a touch sentimental, try this, from \"The Pass\": \"Day after fallen day, these odd delicious moments on which so much depends; unwrapped like papered pears, held close to nose, sniffed, tasted.\" The whole book is like that: perverse, poetic, odd. Many of Almond's sentences are a little pretentious; some don't seem to make sense, but they always feel right, and - aside, perhaps, from \"Geek Player, Love Slayer\" - this is more a book of feelings than of meanings. And considering the lack of happy endings, it will leave you feeling quite wonderful. · Daren King is the author of Boxy an Star (Sceptre)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2002/nov/21/alqaida.saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-21T02:36:15Z","webTitle":"Saudis admit to al-Qaida threat as 100 are held","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/21/alqaida.saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/nov/21/alqaida.saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Saudis admit to al-Qaida threat as 100 are held","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia, normally reluctant to admit to an al-Qaida presence on its soil, conceded yesterday that it had detained more than 100 people and questioned 700. The statement by Prince Nayef, the interior minister, was the first official acknowledgment of so many detainees on terrorism charges in the kingdom since the September 11 attacks on the US last year. Those arrested appear to be Saudi citizens who were living in Afghanistan. \"Prince Nayef unveiled the arrest of more than 100 Saudis who returned from Afghanistan on suspicion of having links to the al-Qaida organisation,\" the al-Eqtisadiah newspaper reported. \"The number of those questioned on this issue was around 700 Saudis,\" the prince added, dismissing reports that the actual number was much higher. The kingdom, which has one of the world's least transparent justice systems, does not routinely announce arrests. In some cases, as has happened with detained Britons, the authorities can delay confirmation for weeks. Although 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11 attacks are believed to have been Saudis, officials in Riyadh initially questioned their identity. In January Prince Nayef revealed that more than 100 of the detainees held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba were Saudi citizens. Until then, the US had only confirmed that the 158 prisoners came from 30 countries, but the prince's remarks showed that Saudi citizens formed the largest group. Prince Nayef also called on the US to return the Guantanamo prisoners to the kingdom but a Pentagon spokeswoman said the US would repatriate prisoners to \"those countries that we feel will handle them appropriately\". On Monday the interior ministry announced that police in the al-Shifa district of Riyadh had captured and wounded a suspected terrorist. Prince Nayef denied reports that eight police officers had been wounded in the battle and gave no indication as to whether the arrested man had al-Qaida connections. Speaking on MBC, the Saudi-owned satellite channel, he said the suspect, Mohammad al-Sahim, was in hospital and would later be interrogated. Opposition sources in London claimed that Mr Sahim was one of about 50 armed al-Qaida sympathisers who had been meeting in a house when police arrived to arrest them. Another report said 15 people - veterans of Afghanistan - were involved. An earlier announcement of arrests linked to al-Qaida followed accusations in the US that Saudi Arabia was doing too little to combat terrorism. In June, the official news agency said Saudi Arabia had detained 13 al-Qaida suspects who were allegedly plotting attacks in the kingdom. Among those held was a Sudanese man who claimed to have fired a missile at an American warplane taking off from the Prince Sultan airbase. The interior ministry indicated that the 13 included at least six Saudis. The ministry did not not say when the arrests took place, though some of the suspects had been held for several months at the time of the announcement. The failed attack on the American plane only came to light when Saudi security guards discovered a missile launcher tube about two miles from a runway at the desert base where 4,500 US troops are stationed. Saad al-Fagih, of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, a London-based Saudi opposition group, suggested at the time that the authorities in Riyadh had not intended to make the discovery public, but were forced to do so because the Americans had become aware of it. He claimed there had been a total of five incidents where pieces of weapons carrying \"the marks of al-Qaida\" had been left as a warning near western installations in the kingdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2002/nov/21/games.shopping1","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-21T00:57:08Z","webTitle":"Official Football Manager  | Kingdom Hearts  | Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/nov/21/games.shopping1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2002/nov/21/games.shopping1","fields":{"headline":"Games watch","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Official Football Manager (Southampton, Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea, Leeds) PC £24.99 Smoking Gun/ Just Football **** Football management games have been around since the mid-80s, and have carved a big niche in the gaming world. Over recent years, one brand - Championship Manager - has risen to the top, with its comprehensive database, regular updates and addictiveness. But as the series has grown, so has its complexity. Then there is the lack of focus on any one club. Recognising a gap in the market, Just Football has nipped in with the Official Football Manager series - a number of games based on individual clubs. Not only can you choose your own team, but you also get specific images of the stadium, changing rooms and fans. If you support one of the teams, you'll thrive on this level of detail. It is also easier to play and more focused than Champ Manager. Yes, you've got lots to deal with, but you could finish a season in an evening, leaving the assistant manager to look after the training schedule. There are no graphical match highlights. Instead, games are shown as a series of textual events, with imagination still vital. Hardcore CM players will be disappointed with the lack of in-depth statistics, although there is more than enough to give you a feeling of control. If the thought of leading, say, Southampton to victory at Anfield makes your pulse quicken, then this is for you. (GH) Kingdom Hearts PS2 £39.99 Sony/Squaresoft **** For those of us who grew up with such classic Disney films as The Jungle Book and Snow White, the big budget Disneyfied movies now produced are less likely to impart a feeling of childhood wonder than induce the feeling that you've just bitten a sugar pig. A Disney spin on the classic Final Fantasy games is therefore seemingly fraught with danger. In fact, Kingdom Hearts perfectly encapsulates the magic from both worlds. The story starts with Sora, a young boy who hasn't known anything but his idyllic island life. He is thrown into a mysterious universe where he learns that an evil force has disrupted the king doms of the world, and only he holds the key to repairing the damage. Disney's magical kingdom is also in turmoil after the disappearance of King Mickey, and the Disney characters call on Sora to help solve the mystery. Aside from the fact that it's in real time rather than turn based, the gameplay mechanics and overall style has many of the typical Final Fantasy hallmarks. The animations are both beautiful and nostalgic, as alongside many recognisable Final Fantasy characters, almost every Disney creation you can think of makes an appearance. Kingdom Hearts is heavy on the cutesy eye candy, but a little of the darker Disney days of The Black Cauldron and Fantasia has been allowed to creep in to give the game a bit more depth. For adults to write this off as \"just for the kiddies\" would be doing themselves out of a magical trip into everyone's childhood fantasy world. (RP) Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 PS2/Xbox/ GameCube £39.99 Neversoft/ Activision ***** A yearly instalment of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has become as inevitable as death and taxes. But it's always a lot more welcome, and Activision has neatly sidestepped potential allegations of cashing in by giving the fourth iteration of its all-conquering skateboarding game a substantial restructuring. Instead of having two minutes to fulfil the objectives laid out at the start of each level, those missions are now acquired by talking to characters within the stages, leaving you free to explore. The silky control system remains the same, although two moves have been added: Spine Transfers and Skitching (in which you cling on to the back of moving vehicles). Everything about the game is bigger and better, notably the levels and the number and diversity of missions. Some of the things you must do to progress are hilarious, such as knocking fishermen's catches into the San Francisco Bay to distract sea lions from a tourist they have cornered, or smashing a wino's pink elephant hallucinations. The game's new format (each level has 16 goals) mercilessly exposes gaps in your ability to string tricks together and now, more than ever, the game allows you to perform stunts that will have onlookers gasping. Precious few games are enjoyable to watch as well as play, but this is. And as it is both funny and exhilarating, it can be seen as a lesson in how to keep an ageing franchise fresh and relevant.

The survey suggests lack of supportive, social networks and the unfamiliarity of life in a foreign country may have made it more difficult for them to rebuild their lives and reinforced their sense of alienation or rejection. In a group of more than 190 Bosnians interviewed by Nigel Hunt and Maha Gekenyi from Nottingham Trent University, those who fled to the United Kingdom suffered more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder than those who were displaced within the former Yugoslav republic. \"There have been other research projects which show those who become refugees in other countries often have more severe psychological problems than those who stay,\" said Dr Hunt. \"The Bosnians who came here were very happy with the way they were received when they arrived. The problems are because of the families they left behind, because of language difficulties and because they may have lost the professional jobs they had in Bosnia and been out of work in Britain.\" Bosnian refugees, mostly Muslim Bosniacs, first began arriving in Britain in 1992 as the Balkans degenerated into inter-ethnic genocide which eventually claimed 250,000 lives. Most were settled in London, the East Midlands or Leeds in a well-funded government programme designed to coordinate local authority responses. Although the study looked at generally comparable groups in Bosnia and Britain - interviewing 69 refugees in the UK and 121 Bosnians who had remained in the country since the begining of the war - slightly more of those who came here tended to have lost familiy members or been injured. That difference may also have affected their reactions. Some Bosnians are only now returning home despite the fact that the conflict formally ended in 1995 with the signing of the Dayton peace accord. The majority of refugees considered their standard of living in Britain to be lower than before the war and they scored significantly higher on the scale used to measure stress than internally displaced people. Only a quarter thought their lives had improved. \"They came here to escape the war, but they are the ones who have experienced the most trauma. It is about problems associated with living in a different culture. Those who stayed in Bosnia felt they had a better standard of living. \"This finding indicates that ideally, though this is not always possible, people should be helped to remain in their own country.\" But Dr Hunt added: \"Many Bosnians, however, now have British passports and have adjusted very well.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2002/nov/20/travelnews.travel","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-20T02:14:48Z","webTitle":"'Americans ignorant of their UK kinsfolk'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/20/travelnews.travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2002/nov/20/travelnews.travel","fields":{"headline":"'Americans ignorant of their UK kinsfolk'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is billed as the greatest special relationship on earth; two countries bound together by common bonds stretching back centuries.

Americans should not take offence, the department said, because he had been just trying to illustrate the importance of using familiar expressions.

In the salons and ministerial suites it's high fashion to demonise the \"centre\", \"centralisation\" or \"command and control\". Listen to Alan Milburn on the government's latest toy, foundation hospitals, and hear him extol community and freedom from central restraint. Ed Balls, the chancellor's economic adviser, extols \"flexibility\" and string-loosening. Even the prime minister muses in his recent Fabian Society pamphlet over Labour's error downplaying its early tradition of \"mutualism, localism and devolution\" . The New Local Government Network makes fun of \"initiativitis\" - as if an active approach to solving social problems were a sin. Critics compare the vice of centralism with (local and regional) diversity, creativity and innovation. So, in the Queen's speech last week, there was much breathless talk about \"community\" as the centre is ordered to pull back and let the local orchids bloom. Of course, every public service, including welfare benefits (which have been centralised ever since they were invented) has a local dimension. But I felt the need to put together a pamphlet for the thinktank Catalyst to warn against an unthinking embrace of what is being called the \"new localism\". What if, along with local differences, go inequality, under-provision of vital services and capriciousness in their delivery? What if the obverse of initiativitis is passivity, a failure to engage with social problems? Without a strong will (towards greater equality, say) where is the motive force of progressive government to be found? Foundation hospitals, relying on local energies and newly empowered managers, may become centres of excellence. But what about the centres of mediocrity next door? For every city academy there will, inevitably, be a half dozen \"bog standard\" comprehensives. For every beacon council there will be a Hull or a Hackney or a Walsall. We need a strong centre for two powerful reasons. One is to combat inequality of local resources. In the United Kingdom wealth and income are mal-distributed, along with the life chances they buy. Should we nonetheless celebrate the \"diversity\" of widespread poverty, huge inter-regional gaps in GDP per head and geographical concentrations of deprivation? Labour needs to loosen its iron grip, the localists say; districts and regions must be cut free from the Whitehall bridles in order to solve their problems in their own way. But \"their own way\" may entail more pupil selection, say, or extra charges for health and social care, or lower wage rates for public sector employees. And how do these local and regional areas, freed from the iron hand of the centre, propose to raise their own resources from economic bases that may already be deprived by de-industrialisation and depopulation? The other justification for a strong centre is to struggle for more not less uniformity in the provision of public services, for less not more diversity in what people can expect in schools, hospitals, leisure services and support. The new localism is a puzzling phenomenon. In recent years we've seen a lot of attention paid to rights: the rights of people with disability, the right to be treated equally regardless of ethnic background, the assertion of human rights. This conversation about rights seems to me to rule out local diversity. The new localism implies that if community A decides it is not too fond of asylum seekers, or if community B decides not to put money into assisting people with disabilities, their decisions take precedence. But some people ask: can't we have national standards and local diversity in their delivery? Only up to a point. The real problem with the new localism is the way it denigrates the centre, implying the state is an ogre, oppressing people in their communities. That sort of criticism may undermine the capacity of the state to levy taxes and engage in the redistribution of money to needy areas. In fact the very definition of \"needy\" is a centralist idea, because it implies there is a single, agreed scale for assessing resources or eligibility for public services. Of course, we should be arguing whether the Blair government's delivery targets are working. Most people, including ministers, now realise there are too many performance indicators for public services and they need to be trimmed. But that is not the same as asserting that local communities are holy and beautiful, and democracy's only true expression comes through local forums. The key point is that local decision-making must ultimately lead to more, not less, diversity in what services are provided and what is spent on them; besides, you cannot assume (as some new localists do) that community decisions will all be progressive and enlightened. If you value diversity - meaning more inequality - that's fine. But traditionally, the party pushing for more inequality has been the Tories. My puzzle about the recent upsurge of the new localism in Labour ranks is the unwillingness (the inability?) of its protagonists to confront the consequences of their beliefs. The new localism means less not more social justice, more not less equality. *In Praise of Centralism: A Critique of the New Localism, £5 from the Catalyst Forum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2002/nov/18/saudiarabia.world","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-18T01:24:08Z","webTitle":"Nurses say party alibi proves innocence of pair held after blast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/18/saudiarabia.world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2002/nov/18/saudiarabia.world","fields":{"headline":"Nurses say party alibi proves innocence of pair held after blast","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two British men detained in Saudi Arabia in connection with a wave of terrorist bombings could not have been responsible for one of the explosions they are charged with, according to new evidence obtained by the Guardian.

The man, whose name has not been disclosed, is being questioned about the murder of 57-year-old Maximillian Graf, whose car exploded in an exclusive district of Riyadh on September 29. He is understood to work in the construction industry and has a Canadian wife employed at a Riyadh hospital. The arrest, and the refusal of the Saudi authorities to allow a visit from his lawyer, have ominous similarities to the case of five Britons currently awaiting a review of their convictions for bomb attacks which killed a British engineer and injured several other westerners. The first bomb went off two years ago today. Earlier this year a Guardian investigation found that the televised confessions from the men, which they later withdrew, had been extracted by torture. The latest explosion - like the previous ones - has been explained by Saudi ministers as being part of a turf war over illegal sale and distribution of alcohol. The five convicted men, their friends and relatives have all denied that a turf war existed. They and Foreign Office ministers - in private, at least - believe the attacks were carried out by Islamic extremists, allied to or inspired by Osama bin Laden. There is growing anger among the men's families that the Foreign Office has not done more to secure the men's release. The Saudis have vigorously denied that militants are targeting foreigners. The day after the explosion the head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Nawwaf, told Al-Jazirah newspaper: \"There are no terror attacks against foreigners in our country. What is happening is part of score settling and feuds between groups competing in illegal and immoral issues. These incidents and blasts cannot be attributed to any particular group or person.\" The following day the interior minister, Prince Naif, made almost identical remarks in Al-Riyadh newspaper, with the additional comment: \"I am sure most probably there are no Saudis, Muslims or Arabs involved.\" Since the arrests of the five Britons - and a Belgian and a Canadian who have also been convicted - the bombings have continued. In June a British banker, Simon Veness, 35, was killed when his Land Rover blew up on his way to work. Saudi denials about violent militants being active in the country are flatly contradicted by events. In June the Saudi Press Agency announced that 13 al-Qaida suspects had been arrested. It said they were planning to use explosives and missiles in terrorist attacks in the kingdom. One of them, it was claimed, had admitted firing a surface-to-air missile at a US plane taking off from Prince Sultan air base. In 1995 and 1996 bomb attacks killed five US military advisers and 19 soldiers.

Almost 50 years ago, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed to the summit of Mount Everest and brought the world's attention to the little-known kingdom of Nepal. But golden jubilee celebrations in the Everest region are in danger of collapsing as Maoist insurgents attempting to overthrow the government in Kathmandu tighten their grip on the approaches to the mountain. In the village of Lukla, gateway to the Mount Everest region, a new airport built to capitalise on a projected boom in the numbers of tourists is now surrounded by razor wire and patrolled by armed troops. At 8pm each evening, a klaxon sounds to mark the start of a curfew. In the Sherpa capital of Namche Bazar, two days' trek up the valley, the army garrison has been reinforced. Trekkers returning from valleys immediately east of the Everest region say Maoist fighters boast they will attack Lukla airport once the trekking season ends later this month. Last February, Maoists detonated home-made bombs inside the airport's control tower, disrupting flights for several days. If the Maoists succeed in taking control of Lukla it will be a humiliation for the new government in Kathmandu and King Gyanendra. Nepal was in political chaos when Hillary and Tenzing reached the capital after their historic climb in 1953, but, 50 years on things are now far worse. Earlier this month Gyanendra sacked the failing elected government and appointed an interim Prime Minister. Fresh elections are planned, but cannot be held until security improves. Last week's death toll climbed to more than 140 after Maoists renewed their strategy of mass attacks on remote police and army posts, mainly in the poorest regions of western Nepal. Three thousand insurgents were reported to have overrun the town of Jumla, close to the Rara Lake National Park, killing 33 police and four soldiers. The army reported recovering 55 bodies of Maoists who died in the attack and a cache of weapons including rifles looted from the security forces. A leading government official and two other civilians were also killed. In Gorkha, 95 miles west of Kathmandu, 23 police died in a similar raid. Security forces reported recovering the bodies of 63 Maoists but the death toll was expected to rise. East of Kathmandu, a land mine planted by rebels blew up a bus on Thursday, killing two people and injuring 22 others. The bus was crowded with passengers as public transport reopened following a general strike called by the Maoists, which left Nepal's crumbling economy paralysed for three days. The conflict has been shockingly brutal in a country more famous for the warm welcome it extends to visitors. According to government sources, almost 8,000 people have died in the six-year insurgency, most in the past year. More than 6,000 rebels are reported to have died, according to government officials. More than 850 police have also died, many of them attacked in the dead of night in remote outposts. Despite their ambition to overthrow the king and establish a Communist state, Maoist leaders have gone out of their way to reassure tourists that they will not be harmed. Tourists are seen as an economic opportunity, not just by the government and the Maoists but also by local gangsters who use the Maoists' reputation to intimidate Westerners. Mountaineer Doug Scott, a director of Community Action Nepal, says a fund-raising trek just returned from central Nepal was robbed by Maoists. 'They're usually very polite and non-threatening about it. Trek leaders are approached and there's a good-natured haggling process to fix a price. In the six years since the insurgency began, not one single Westerner has been harmed.' Nepal's new Deputy Prime Minister, Badri Prasad Mandal, said last week that the government wants to resume talks. The Maoists, too, have claimed they want to negotiate a settlement. Despite reassurances from all sides, tourism has slumped by more than 70 per cent. Almost half a million people used to visit Nepal, earning one of the world's poorest countries £100 million and employing 200,000. Peter Gibbs of British trekking outfitters Himalayan Kingdoms said the company was monitoring the situation daily and would cancel holidays and refund clients if necessary. 'We are guided by the advice of the Foreign Office and we have local agents on the ground who keep us reliably informed.' Himalayan Kingdoms has planned eight separate trips to Everest to celebrate the golden jubilee. Events planned range from the world's highest marathon to an elephant polo tournament. In London, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will attend a special gala lecture featuring members of the successful 1953 expedition. Hillary will travel to Kathmandu to lead the celebrations there on the anniversary of the climb, 29 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2002/nov/17/features.review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-17T04:28:05Z","webTitle":"Hamish McAlpine: controversial film boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/nov/17/features.review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2002/nov/17/features.review","fields":{"headline":"Too much verité...","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Hamish McAlpine doesn't bruise easily. As head of the London-based film company Metro Tartan, responsible for distributing some of the most provocative arthouse movies around, from French director Bertrand Bonello's The Pornographer to Japanese S&amp;M shocker Audition, he's used to taking flak from both critics and censors. But today, McAlpine, 47, is nursing a broken nose, split lip and facial bruising. The culprit? One of McAlpine's own directors, the US filmmaker Larry Clark, whose sexually explicit new film, Ken Park, McAlpine had been promoting at this month's London Film Festival. Ten days ago, Clark attacked McAlpine at the Charlotte Street Hotel in London, after the pair became embroiled in a discussion about the 11 September attacks. Laura De Casto, managing editor of Metro Tartan, was sitting next to Clark when the fight broke out. 'I saw Mr Clark stand up, throw a punch at Mr McAlpine, kick the table over, jump at him on the ground, and start choking him.' After restaurant staff intervened, Clark spent four hours in police cells, while McAlpine was taken to hospital. All press interviews were cancelled and Ken Park was withdrawn from the Film Festival, a bittersweet victory given that McAlpine had spent a lot of time convincing the festival that this film, which includes scenes of incest, troilism and ejaculation, was worthy of inclusion. But McAlpine now says: 'I was not prepared to put up with the presence of a racist man.' The general feeling was that McAlpine had had a narrow escape. After all, Clark served time in a US maximum security jail in the late 1970s for a variety of offences, including shooting someone in the arm. 'I'm sorry I lost control,' Clark revealed afterwards in a signed statement. 'But if I had awoken this morning after listening to him last night and hadn't hit him I don't think I could have looked at myself in the mirror.' Clark later admitted that he was attending anger management courses. Arguably the most depressing aspect of 'Larrygate' was the way the new American Right (the very people who loathe Clark's films) united with anarchist US websites to champion him as a patriotic hero. 'Director Larry Clark beat the crap out of limey Hamish McAlpine when Hamish started running down the good ol' US of A,' declared one site. 'Clark, who helmed Kids and Bully, delivered a brutal beatdown to Hamish McAlpine after the screwy Scotsman started spewing anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments during dinner at London's posh Charlotte Street Hotel,' triumphed another. So who is Hamish McAlpine and why would anyone want to strangle him? I'd been expecting a pugnacious bruiser but, in the flesh, McAlpine is small and delicately handsome. He arrives with a flourish, dressed in a greatcoat and sunglasses (his staff affectionately describe him as a 'Prada tramp'). His appearance is an intriguing mix of guerrilla film producer and suave old Harrovian. And there's no denying a life of privilege. He was born on the third floor of the Dorchester hotel and his school chums included the Marquesses of Bristol and Blandford, but he insists he's always had socialist leanings. 'If my life has been worth anything, it has been to create a liberal landscape for the arts and free thinking in the UK.' McAlpine arouses strong emotions. But according to film producer Nik Powell, a friend and one-time rival film distributor: 'Hamish is the stuff of Soho legend. Thank God we've still got some characters left in our business, which in general has become very corporatised.' McAlpine has certainly got chutzpah. This is his first interview to discuss the outcome of his clash with Clark, and he fixes me with a saddened gaze. 'Bad news, I'm afraid. Larry Clark has issued a full and unreserved apology for his actions.' Then, eyes twinkling, 'We've all had our moment and we've just agreed that we're not going to speak about it any more. It's not good for the film, it's not good for his career. I'm very happy with Larry's apology but we're not going to distribute the film any more. Life goes on.' I ask McAlpine, a well-known champion of free speech, how he felt about censoring one of his own directors. Isn't there an irony about a libertarian being forced to put his foot down? 'Our view was that we were never censoring the film,' McAlpine says. 'First of all, we were happy to let the screening of the film go ahead at the festival, but we said at the time that we weren't prepared to do that if Larry remained in the UK. So, in fact, that was a decision taken by Larry, not by us.' Clark's BNP-style remarks have never been clarified. But according to Nik Powell: 'I'm sure personally Hamish would never want to see any sort of censorship per se, other than of that which incites racial hatred, which, in any event, is against the law here. So it's censorship in the broader sense of the word, not censorship with a capital C.' Until 'Larrygate', November had been a great month for McAlpine. He had just succeeded in persuading the British Board of Film Classification to pass Gaspar Noé's rape revenge film, Irreversible, starring Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel without a single cut (despite a brutal nine-minute rape scene). There are mutterings of a possible posthumous Oscar for Richard Harris for his performance in Metro Tartan's film, My Kingdom. And Tatler devoted four pages to McAlpine's party lifestyle. (For the record he's embroiled in a bitter divorce from his third wife, has a chauffeur and hangs out with artists such as Tracey Emin and Matt Collishaw.) Tatler did paint McAlpine as a dilettante aristo but actually his work affects huge numbers of moviegoers. Established in 1992, Metro Tartan specialises in independent film and world cinema. Its crossover hits include The Last Seduction, Cinema Paradiso and In the Mood for Love . It introduced unknown directors Pedro Almodóvar, Atom Egoyan, Hal Hartley and Todd Haynes to the UK. And, through its video label, it handles classic directors such as Eisenstein, Passolini and Truffaut. In addition, McAlpine owns a booking company called Zoo Productions, which programmes for the Ritzy, the Gate Notting Hill and the Electric in London. Then there's his string of cinemas such as the Regals. But it's always Metro Tartan's cult sex and horror films that hit the headlines. Its dogged battle with the censor resulted in Lars von Trier's The Idiots showing the first-ever film erection in the UK. And this month, it releases three films certain to get the Daily Mail in a lather - Bundy, based on the life of the US serial killer Ted Bundy, L.I.E. with Brian Cox as a scarily charming paedophile and Claire Denis's vampire shocker, Trouble Every Day starring Béatrice Dalle and Vincent Gallo. But Nik Powell denies they're just shock merchants. 'For me, the films Metro Tartan represent show that they go all the way from the classical to the extreme genre pictures. It shows just what an eclectic, risk-taking company it is.' McAlpinestresses that he doesn't just go to Cannes looking for serial killer movies. He insists his prime motivation is artistic merit. 'Larrygate' could actually be the best thing that ever happened to Metro Tartan. Cynics have even suggested it may have been a stunt, but Nik Powell doubts this. 'Knowing Hamish, I don't think it would have started with that intention. He's quite passionate, especially after a couple of bottles of red wine.' So is this sort of spat common at film festivals? 'It does happen,' Powell acknowledges. 'It's very much a part of our industry, when passionate people are brought together through their love of a common art form.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2002/nov/17/foreignpolicy.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-17T01:02:13Z","webTitle":"Is the British Empire to blame?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/17/foreignpolicy.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/nov/17/foreignpolicy.comment","fields":{"headline":"Is the British Empire to blame?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"\"I'm not a liberal imperialist. There's a lot wrong with liberalism, with a capital L, although I am a liberal with a small L. And there's a lot wrong with imperialism. A lot of the problems we are having to deal with now are a consequence of our colonial past. India, Pakistan - we made some quite serious mistakes. We were complacent about what happened in Kashmir, the boundaries weren't published until two days after independence. Bad story for us, the consequences are still there. Afghanistan - where we played a less than glorious role over a century and a half .. The odd lines for Iraq's borders were drawn by Brits. The Balfour declaration andthe contradictory assurances which were being given to Palestinians in private at the same time as they were being given to Israelis - again, an interesting history for us but not an entirely honourable one\" Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary, New Statesman interview. \"Because of the British Empire and the incredible sprawl that it achieved, Britain has interests and responsibilities on a global scale. Where Jack Straw is wrong is to assume that so many global problems were caused by the Empire. The problems were always there - but the Empire allowed two centuries of respite from the bloodshed that had been there before and which was likely to come again. Also the problems in both Kashmir and the Middle East are largely down to the Attlee government getting out before putting proper structures in place. So if anybody is to blame, its the Labour Party and especially the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claims to admire most, Ernest Bevin.\" Andrew Roberts, historian. \"There is a direct link between failed states and contemporary Islamic terrorism. States like Afghanistan and Pakistan have had huge difficulties in fulfilling the aspirations of their citizens and developing genuine legitimacy because they were hamstrung by borders that made no ethnic, cultural, linguistic or even geographic sense imposed by imperial powers. Discontent at illegitimate regimes led to protest, protest has been crushed and its root causes have not been dealt with. Result: violent terroristic activism. Iraq is inherently unstable. So is the Sudan. Jack Straw did not mention the profound problems resulting from the British tactic of co-opting local elites. His honesty, however, should be applauded.\" Jason Burke, Chief Reporter, The Observer \"Britain's withdrawal from Empire often left a great deal of unfinished business. In the case of partition (e.g. Ireland, the British Raj, and the Palestinian mandate), the creation of new states was based primarily on religious affiliation making it harder for post-colonial states to build multi-cultural societies. In other parts of the world, borders were left unresolved (e.g.Belize-Guatemala; Guyana-Venezuela) giving rise to dangerous tensions. In Africa, the \"Westminster model\" proved difficult to sustain and even more difficult to replace once it had been discredited. Britain's colonial past is not glorious and the first step is to recognize this, but it does provide an opportunity to contribute to a resolution of these problems. The citizens of the United Kingdom and UK residents from former colonies can provide the UK government with unique insights based on collective memory while reminding the British authorities of their responsibilities.\" Victor Bulmer-Thomas, Director, Royal Institute of International Affairs \"This country should recognise that it has an Empire which did certain things - good and bad - and then it has to move on. To a certain extent, this is not very useful because it can imprison you in the past. The past should be a guide but we must not become imprisoned by history. There should be more understanding and a greater awareness of the Empire - certainly in Kashmir and Afghanistan, much of what has gone on has been shaped by British rule. The problem is that you too often get a snapshot picture and not the wide-angle perspective which you need to solve the problems now. The Empire has created situations, and especially feelings, which are perhaps not appreciated or understood. As CLR James said, the people in far-flung places whose lives were shaped by the British Empire know more more about what happened than do the British themselves.\" Mihir Bose, writer and commentator Send us your views Email Observer site editor Sunder Katwala at observer@guardianunlimited.co.uk with comments on articles or ideas for future pieces.

It was a euphemism: Columbus's seizure of Indians in the Bahamas as slaves was hardly friendly. The word is far more appropriate to describe the meeting that took place in Mexico in November 1519, between Montezuma, whom we have come to think of as the \"emperor\" of the Aztecs, and the explorer Hernando Cortés. The meeting occurred on the southern causeway leading from the mainland across the Lake of Mexico to Montezuma's capital of Tenochtitlán, now at the heart of Mexico City. (Today the convent of San Antonio Abad stands near the site, on a road that leads south from the city centre.) Cortés came with his four or five hundred Europeans, plus bearers and servants from the indigenous, non-Aztec, tribes whom he had persuaded to serve him. Those tribes were keen to support a foreign military leader who might help them overthrow the Aztecs. Cortés made a great impression. He and his fellow leaders, such as Pedro de Alvarado and Gonzalo de Sandoval (most of the captains came from Extremadura, west Spain), rode on fine Spanish horses. They also had a few fighting dogs, which was disturbing to the Aztecs, and carried cannon on carts - the wheel thereby entering the Aztec imagination for the first time. In addition, there were arquebusiers who could cause a violent detonation even if their fire was inaccurate. The Spanish leaders wore iron armour, which might seem heavy but certainly assisted Christian propaganda. Probably the Aztecs would already have heard of the Spaniards' long, menacing swords, wielded in the journey up from the coast to deadly effect. Cortés was accompanied by a priest, a Mercedarian friar and a few women. Among the latter was Marina, a Mexican who had become Cortés's mistress. (It was a characteristic of this expedition that many Indian girls had already associated with Spanish soldiers.) Marina had learned the Maya language when enslaved by those people; she could communicate with Montezuma and others by translating the Aztec language Nahuatl into Maya, which in turn would be translated by Gerónimo Aguilar, an Andalusian who had lived some years in Yucatan in Maya territory. This was a slow but effective means of communication that enabled Cortés to speak to the indigenous people. Cortés did that well, having been trained as a boy as an acolyte in a church in Medellín, his home town in Extremadura. He was particularly eloquent when explaining the nature and the appeal of Christianity. (The Spaniards also possessed the art of writing, so communications could be passed easily from commander to captain, a factor that played an important part in their capacity for war.) According to the chroniclers, Cortés was received on the causeway by Montezuma himself, surrounded by the elaborately beplumed Aztec nobility. A man walked in front of the emperor carrying a carved pole to indicate his authority. The Spaniards would have found that element in the ceremony familiar; some might even have appreciated the admirable carving that adorned the pole. The emperor may not have wanted to receive Cortés so well, but the tradition of hospitality made it essential. The Aztecs may have had a brutal religion involving what seems to have been an ever-increasing amount of human sacrifice, but they were very well-mannered. Montezuma's green litter was elaborately adorned with the gold jewels, fine embroidery, featherwork and other ornamentation for which the Aztec civilisation is renowned. Much of the gold jewellery is lost: after the conquest the Spaniards melted it down for their own purposes. The Aztecs did not have silver of their own, but some made its way to Tenochtitlán from its neighbouring state, called Michoacán by the Spaniards. The emperor probably wore an embroidered cloak, with gold-decorated sandals and a green feathered headdress comparable to that which can be seen in the Museum of Mankind in Vienna. He kissed his hand to Cortés after touching the earth. Cortés apparently merely asked: \"Art thou not he? Art thou not Montezuma?\" He then presented Montezuma with a pearl necklace, probably gathered from the island of Margarita off Venezuela, where Spanish pearl-seekers were already active. In return, Montezuma gave Cortés a double necklace of red snails' shells, from which hung eight shrimps made of gold. The red may be significant: it is possible that Montezuma believed Cortés was a reincarnation of the lost god Quetzalcoatl, deity of culture and the wind, who had disappeared over the eastern sea many generations before. By suggesting an identification of Cortés with Quetzalcoatl, Montezuma may have been practising an internal political game whose secrets are not now obvious. Montezuma then addressed Cortés. If what some chroniclers say occurred, it must have been the most remarkable welcome in history. According to Fray Bernardino Sahagún, a Franciscan monk who devoted his long life to recovering the nature of Aztec civilisation, Montezuma said: \"O our lord, thou hast suffered fatigue, thou hast endured weariness, thou hast come to arrive on earth. Thou hast come to govern thy city of Mexico, thou hast come to descend upon thy mat, upon thy seat which for a moment I have guarded for thee... I by no means merely dream, I do not see in my sleep. I do not merely dream that I see thee, that I look into thy face... The rulers departed maintained that thou wouldst come to visit thy city, that thou wouldst descend upon thy mat, upon the seat.\" Although Sahagún's translation from 16th-century Nahuatl has come in for many sceptical comments, some such elaborate words of welcome were surely made. And such speeches should not be taken at face value. \"This is your house,\" Spaniards say, without supposing for a moment that the person addressed will move in. After this meeting, Cortés and his comrades felt surrounded in a city that was larger than any they had seen in Europe. They seized Montezuma and made him a hostage in the palace they had been allocated (now more or less on the site of the large pawnshop on the west side of the Plaza del Zócalo in Mexico City). For six months, relations were good and Cortés taught Montezuma how to use an arquebus. Then a Spanish expedition from Cuba landed at Veracruz, forcing Cortés to lend aid to the governor of Cuba. Cortés went down to the coast and routed these new conquistadors (he told Montezuma that they were all Basques). In his absence, his exuberant deputy, Alvarado, whom he had left behind with 120 men, decided that a rising was about to be made against him. In a pre-emptive strike (as George Bush would put it), he fell on the nobility of Tenochtitlán while they danced at a feast. Cortés returned immediately but had to withdraw from the city, carrying out a retreat over the causeways in what has become known as la noche triste (\"the sad night\"), during which many Spaniards were captured and later sacrificed on top of pyramids specially designed so that the ceremony could be seen from afar. Montezuma was killed by a stone, probably thrown by one of his own followers as he was speaking from a rooftop to the Aztecs in an attempt to negotiate peace. Cortés regrouped with the help of some indigenous allies, in particular the people of Tlaxcala. He mounted a siege of the city in 1521. It took three months for the city to be subdued, and it was mostly destroyed during the fighting. The Aztecs surrendered, Cortés rebuilt the city and, within a few years, most of what is now modern Mexico had become the Spanish kingdom of New Spain run by a viceroy. A plaque in the site of the old Aztec temple says that modern Mexico began there, and the brilliant modern state does indeed descend from an encounter between these two imperial peoples. © Hugh Thomas. · Aztecs is at the Royal Academy, London W1, until April 11.

Some of them are; many others are scattered around the globe. He also says that \"few editions\" of Clare's poetry have appeared since 1965, and he seeks to blame Eric Robinson for this. I have a shelf full of such editions; Clare has in fact been more fortunate than most poets in this respect. Professor Robinson has been an energetic champion of Clare, and has done more than anyone to arouse and sustain interest in the poet, and to get his writings into print. To the best of my knowledge Robinson has always encouraged and assisted other editors, even when he disapproves of their treatment of Clare's poems. Robert Heyes Tonbridge Fencing for laughs Discussing Basil Rathbone's career as a fencing villain, Richard Cohen (\"En garde!\", November 9) did not recall Rathbone's turn in The Court Jester (1955), in which he fights a comic duel with Danny Kaye. Off they go, up and down the spiral staircase, over the tables, not forgetting the row of burning candles sliced through by Kaye which does not topple straight away. Rathbone falls into a chute and is tipped into the moat. Jessica Yates Enfield Proust in economy class Both Paul Davis (Review, November 2) and Michael Murphy (Letters, November 9) perpetuate mystic notions about Proust's sentences. It is not that \"he couldn't make them any shorter\". The multi-clause sentence can reproduce in its grammatical structure the relationships between experience, recollection and anticipation that is such a vital part of The Search. To give an example, the young Marcel refuses to go to a dinner with his father because of his love for Gilberte, but had he gone he would have met Albertine, with whom he later falls in love. Kilmartin renders Proust's sentence thus: \"We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will one day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account today, whom we shall love tomorrow, whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have loved a little sooner and who would thus have put an end to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place.\" This sentence contains information that a) Marcel, the character could not have known but which might have changed his life; b) \"Marcel\" the narrator knows uselessly; c) Marcel the author makes use of by offering it to the reader. Almost the same effect could have been created by several shorter sentences, but using more words. In this sense Proust's sentences are actually an example of literary economy. Stephen Devereux Liverpool An idol moment While reading Blake Morrison's review of Roger Lewis's biography of Anthony Burgess (\"Kingdom of the wicked\", November 9), I could not help but be reminded of the film Barton Fink, in which a promising young writer meets an author, Bill Mayhew, whom he idolises. That is until Barton gets to know him personally and the myth is shattered. The Burgess biography should act as a warning to anyone who feels they have to \"know\" their idols personally. Ian Gray Beverley, East Yorks Don't write science off David Lodge says (\"Sense and Sensibility\", November 2) that, while fiction writers can record the individual experiences of consciousness, neuropsychologists can't explain much about it. This is not true. Human consciousness is to a large extent mediated by language and is connected to many other processes, and theoretical breakthroughs in neurology have often come in the past when elements of the components of these connected systems are damaged. For example, Alexander Luria discovered a lot about higher mental processes through studying aphasia. Mike Hames South Nutfield, Surrey David Lodge would like us to agree that the novelists have beaten the neuroscientists because they have provided the most accurate record of human consciousness. The only reasonable reply is \"So far\". When the neuroscientists have had as long as the novelists and philosophers he may well have to eat his words. Frank Evans Orpington, Kent I recently attended a conference run jointly by the Philosophy Special Interest group and the Faculty for the Psychiatry of Old Age, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. This two-day conference aimed \"to foster discussion of philosophical issues and conceptual difficulties raised by dementia\". Consciousness and the impact of dementia on self-consciousness was a key theme. The clearest sense of what it might feel like to have a dementia was provided by John Killick, the after dinner speaker, a poet who works with people who have dementia. \"all these young people good men, nice boys, fine chaps they are too busy to see\" Dr Chris Allen Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury, Bucks ·Send letters to Review, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER review@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2002/nov/14/thefiver.sport","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-14T17:32:34Z","webTitle":"Confusing,  Very long, and To the point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/nov/14/thefiver.sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2002/nov/14/thefiver.sport","fields":{"headline":"Confusing,  Very long, and To the point","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"THE FIVER OF DISCONTENT It's just like the 1970s.

Not only can you think what Roy Keane thinks in that autobiography he had nothing to do with your honour, from November 25 you can see what Roy Keane sees in the video nasty As I See It, £12.99 from all good stocking-filler stockists. \"This film traces the career of the man who shuns publicity,\" reads the publicity. \"Keane tells it how it is in the sensational all-new film!\" So what can we expect? Well, it's a PG, so presumably a f*** of a lot of dubbing-out for starters. And another FA fine and ban? After all, he doesn't mince his words when talking about his sending off for an altercation with Alan Shearer last season. \"I was sent off for pushing him but if you're going to get sent off, you might as well punch him properly,\" he says, probably while instructing the little children just how to do so. \"It's the same punishment. You might as well get hung for a sheep as a lamb.\" But the English FA seem to have been afflicted by the same myopia that has left the FAI unable to see beyond the glow emanating from Royston's halo - and are believed to be taking no further action! The FAI meanwhile have even gone so far as to provide a Royston soundtrack which has also come out in time for Chrimbletide - commissioning a group called Genesis to produce a report/album lamenting Royston's broken relationship with Ireland. In one of the songs about Royston, Jesus He Knows Me (and He Knows I'm Right), Genesis sing: \"Keane is a consummate professional, obsessed with excellence and attention to details.\" Another track about Ireland, called Land of Confusion, includes a line about Royston's team play. \"Such driven professionalism can be intimidating to many around him, making him a loner, often isolated from the squad.\" And in the album's rousing finale about Royston's influence on the young, a track called Follow You, Follow Me, Genesis bleat: \"He is a perfectionist ... others would do well to follow.\" Hmm, they lost it when Peter Gabriel left, if you ask us. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Mark thanks the press for his support at this difficult time\" - A spokesperson for Mark Bosnich, who has \"severe clinical depression\", lays the irony on a bit too thickly. NO BOON FOR TOON You saw Rir Sobby Bobson last night. You watched that jowly spaniel grin a thousand grins. You danced to his touchline gig. You know he can walk on water. But crushingly it seems there is an end to his talents. Rir Sobby cannot, after all, make black-and-white money grow on black-and-white trees. Contrary to expectations, riches beyond avarice are not going to flow to the city of Newcastle. An unkind Mr Stan Locke, football analyst-cum-stockbroker, has bad news for those share-holders who were considering cashing in and buying a second home in that other, sunnier, city of the stripes. \"Newcastle will make about £10m from the next phase and financially that is very good news,\" thunders Locke. \"But I can't see their success having much impact on the share price. People have stopped investing in clubs the last two or three years. Why would you want to invest in a football club? The uncertainty of every result makes it a risky business. Clubs rarely pay a dividend to shareholders. If they make money it usually goes back into players' pockets.\" Well maybe that's true, Stan. But there's no need to be quite so black and white about it. THE RUMOUR MILL Racing Club striker Diego Milito wants to play in England because England produces the \"best level of football in the world right now.\" Unfortunately for him, only Southampton have shown in any interest so far. Alen Boksic is going back to Croatia in the summer to play for his home town club Hadjuk Split. Bixente Lizarazu is to leave \"crisis-hit\" Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich because he wants to play for \"one of Europe's top five clubs\". NEWS IN BRIEF Manchester United have invited Neale Cooper to Old Trafford for a coaching stint following his resignation as Ross County manager. Celtic's CIS Insurance Cup semi-final with Dundee United will take place on Thursday February 6. It will be televised live cross the United Kingdom by Channel Five, who also have exclusive rights to the final on Sunday March 16. The other semi, between Rangers and Hearts, is scheduled for Tuesday February 4, although Rangers have a league game at home to Aberdeen just two days before that. Both games are likely to be played at Hampden Park but this has still to be confirmed. The liberal reputation of Holland is under threat after an over-zealous soccer snogger was suspended. An unnamed player in the amateur KNVB league was so infuriated by his second yellow card that grabbed the referee by the head and planted a huge smacker on his lips. The punishment for this \"inappropriate behaviour\" is an eight-match ban. The tenth official sponsor of the 2006 world cup finals in Germany has been announced. Dutch electronics company Philips will join adidas, Avaya, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Telekom, Gillette, McDonald's, Toshiba and Yahoo in a vast advertising junket. Their participation gave Franz Beckenbauer material for his joke of the day. \"We now know for sure that the Dutch will be there,\" he said. There will be no Fredi Bobic in the German side to play against the Netherlands on Wednesday. Despite a poll in German soccer magazine Kicker which revealed that 73% of fans wanted him back, German coach Rudi Voeller has resisted. The 31-year-old Bobic, who last played for Germany in 1998, will have to be happy at Hanover 96 where he has already scored eight goals this season.

The American imperium has many similarities to the old Roman empire - vassal kings, inherited leadership, and alliances for diplomacy. But unlike Rome, it does not use military conquest. Perhaps this is because it still sees itself as having arisen from the yoke of an older empire; perhaps because it sees itself as an ally rather than an exploiter - the world's policeman rather than its ruler. But in moving from vassal kings to vassal prime ministers, little has changed. Around the world, from Chile to Indonesia - and Iraq? - leaders rule only with the tacit blessing of the American imperium. The real change is not the extent of the puppet kingdom, but the use of treaties which demand that all obey the Codex Americanus, the Washington consensus - privatisation and deregulation, minimal state, openness of the economy to foreign investment, free convertibility of currency, and so on. Even those who regard themselves as democratically elected leaders are in fact the representatives of the US. This is rule by treaty rather than direct rule, in which nations voluntarily opt for dominion status. It has been said that the 20th century was the American century. The 21st century may see the dawning of a world government, with the US running that government. David Simmons, Northolt, Middx. Why are aliens green? Almost all living things can be classified as being either animals or plants. Thus it would seem that on another planet there could be a 50% chance that intelligent life evolved from the vegetable kingdom. This philosophy was behind the strip cartoon about 50 years ago featuring square-jawed hero Dan Dare, who jetted into space and landed on the planet Venus. There he found the dominant hominoids had chlorophyll green skins and were called \"treens\". A generation of children absorbed these ideas from the Eagle comics; science-fiction writers continued the tradition. John Rudge, Harlington, Middx. They turn green with envy when they see our beautiful planet. Later, they become white with rage when they see what we have done to it. Alan Ashley, Bramford, Suffolk. George Orwell's 1939 novel Coming Up For Air mentions \"some filthy stuff called bee wine, which was supposed to cost nothing at all because you made it out of water\". It also said that the wine \"gives you cancer\". Did this beverage have any basis in fact? My father remembered bee wine from his childhood in rural Wales around 1910. Dorothy Hartley travelled Britain collecting food and folklore and wrote: \"In the mid-50s, it was not uncommon to see, in sunny front-room windows of terrace houses in industrial areas, a large glass jar, full of crystal clear liquid. This was bee wine in the making. The 'bees' were small white objects, each about the size and shape of a bee larva. I never found out exactly what they were, or how to get hold of some. \"When the sun shone on the jar, the 'bees' would rise up in the jar, presumably buoyed up by small bubbles. When they reached the surface, they would sink gently down again. The bees would be said to be 'working'. In overcast weather, the 'bees' would lie still on the bottom. It seems that sunlight was necessary to the production process.\" Dave Major Carlingcott, Congresbury, Bristol. In the late 80s I worked in the National Collection of Yeast Cultures, where one of my weekly jobs was \"looking after the bees\". This was a large flask that sat on the lab windowsill containing water and a large number of creamy gelatinous nodules. Similar to a ginger-beer plant, these generated a sweet-smelling, slightly sticky liquid and multiplied at a prodigious rate. Each week I would clear out the surplus nodules and top the flask up with water and, if memory serves me well, some sugar - otherwise the culture would quite happily look after itself. I was told that this particular culture had a recorded existence going back to the 1940s and possibly originated in the early 19th century, but was probably one of the very last in existence. I don't think the nodules had ever been subjected to detailed investigation, but I believe they consisted of communities of yeast with other micro-organisms. Ian Simmons, Norwich. What is love? Confusion on this matter arises primarily because of the inadequacy of the English language. I love my children, my sexual partner, cricket, roast duckling, my friends, and, if I try, my enemies. The word in fact covers a range of meanings, which in Greek are expressed in four quite different words. Eros, from which is derived erotic; storge, meaning family affection (or not!); philia, meaning liking (as in philosopher, philanthropist); and - the word used in I Corinthians 13, 4 - agape, or what Kant called goodwill: sympathy, empathy, non-exploitation of others. Many kindly people think they're being wicked because they dislike some of their fellows: but liking people relates to chemistry rather than disposition. One can have agape where there is no philia, which is why Paul called it the greatest. This dichotomy (or quadrotomy) explains why mother-in-law and son-in-law often don't get on: the storge of one conflicts with the eros of the other, so there's no philia: but agape can still keep the peace. The best thing to do with the word love is to expel it from the language, because without further explanation it is always ambiguous, as in: \"Alcohol is my enemy, but I'm told to love my enemies.\" Ray Billington, Springfield, Monmouthshire.

Net losses for the year to October were 33m euros, compared with a profit of 30m euros the previous year. Analysts' expectations had been for losses ranging from 12m euros to 27m euros. A worldwide fanfare of publicity surrounded the opening of Walt Disney Studios theme park in March, contributing to exceptional costs of 38m euros. But by July executives were forced to concede that visitor numbers were little more than 13m, compared to 12m a year earlier when only the company's Magic Kingdom theme park was operational. Some analysts suggest the two parks - which are located side by side, to the east of Paris - have been cannibalising each other's audience. Euro Disney's finance director, Serge Naim, insisted that hotel capacity was the biggest headache. He said the marketing push for Walt Disney Studios had generated a tidal wave of demand this summer, which led to many visitors staying away because of a lack of hotel rooms. Mr Naim denied the costly publicity campaign had been misjudged. Some 1,500 additional rooms next spring would be able to accommodate demand. Together, the company expects its two parks to draw 16m-17m visitors in two year's time. Chief executive Jay Rasulo said: \"Despite the difficult tourism environment... our Walt Disney Studios attracted more than two million guests during the first six months... and our hotels reported occupancy levels of 88%.\" Some analysts suggested this summer's marketing fiasco had almost been an inevitability. \"Above all, they could not afford for the new park to fail,\" said Arnaud Frerault of SG Securities. Euro Disney, which is 40% owned by Walt Disney Co of America, booked a one-off charge of 37m euros relating to hiring and training staff as well as publicity campaigns for Walt Disney Studios. The company was also hit by a 7m euro insurance premium after concern about terrorist attacks heightened after September 11. Euro Disney yesterday promised investors it would keep a tight reign on marketing spend in this financial year and was not planning costly new attractions at either of its parks. There are now 10 attractions at Walt Disney Studios compared with 40 at Magic Kingdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2002/nov/14/localgovernment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-14T00:47:11Z","webTitle":"The Euro vision of devolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/14/localgovernment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2002/nov/14/localgovernment","fields":{"headline":"The Euro vision of devolution","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1: Austria Without doubt the European Union's most decentralised country, with devolution of power guaranteed constitutionally and delivered practically. There is a true partnership between local authorities, the regional governments (the Länder) and the federal government. But despite being a federal country, 65% of public expenditure is still managed by the central government in Vienna. 2: Netherlands Dutch local government is the envy of its EU peers. While the Netherlands' constitution might still bear the centralising mark of the country's occupation by Napoleonic France, the political culture now tends to seek consensus through consultation. But Dutch councils want still more power, arguing that they do not have enough of a say over the EU legislation that they are expected to implement on the ground. 3: Denmark, Finland, Sweden The three most northern EU member states are formally very centralised with no legal framework for consultation with lower levels of government. But it goes against the Nordic mindset to impose legislation from above. Consultation is seen as an expression of the democratic values that these countries cherish. This means that central government consults local authorities even though there is no constitutional obligation to do so. 6: Germany Federal Germany might look like an icon of decentralisation, with its states (also known as Länder) agreeing their own laws in their own parliaments. But the problem, as with Belgium, is that the states often do not consult effectively with local authorities. Because they are last in the chain to be consulted, their input can come too late to be effective. 7: Belgium Belgium is a federal country, and its regions have legislative powers and two levels of local authority - the municipality and the province. The handing of powers to the regions has worked well, but devolution often stops at that level, missing out the local authorities. 8: Italy The recent Bassanini law has increased the powers of Italy's regions by ensuring they have a hand in deciding on all regional and interregional matters. But consultation below the regional level tends to be cosmetic. A \"unified conference\" bringing together representatives from regions, cities and local government was set up five years ago, and it has been successful in strengthening the voice of local authorities, particularly on economic and financial issues. 9: Luxembourg In the EU's tiniest country, central government consults widely on proposed legislation. Even chambers of commerce have a say. Bizarrely, local authorities do not enjoy the same privilege. This sometimes results in business interests being put above those of local government, and local authorities have seen their share of income tax revenue fall. 10: France France has traditionally been one of Europe's most politically centralised countries. The opening paragraph of its constitution describes the country as \"a single and indivisible republic\", so plans announced last month to give more power to regional assemblies in matters of education, health, housing and transport from next June will require a constitutional change. In 1982, in a limited move towards decentralisation, the socialist government set up 22 regions, but left the 96 existing counties, or départements, untouched. Regions were given a strategic role, covering areas such as transport planning, economic development and environmental matters. 11: Spain The centralising instincts of the Franco era mean that the concept of local self-government is less than 25 years old in Spain. The Madrid government's troubled relations with the Basque country and Catalonia give the lie to any claims that the country's devolved regional governments have much real power. The Basque Nationalist party has been in power for 19 years and has made no bones about its long-term goal of independence. The prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has nonetheless ruled out any greater regional self-determination and refuses to acknowledge recent calls by the Basques and the Catalans for referendums on sharing sovereignty with Madrid. 12: United Kingdom An imperialist mindset has tended to prevail. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own devolved parliaments, but England has only nine administrative regions with no elected administration outside London. They were set up more out of a desire to claim EU regional funding than any great commitment to decentralisation. The UK government is now preparing legislation to create democratic regional government, and a central-local government partnership meets five times a year so councillors and ministers can discuss matters of joint interest. 13: Ireland Consultation is not guaranteed and communication networks between Dublin and its local authorities tend to be informal. The chances of local concerns being acted upon tend to depend on the local member of parliament arguing their case persuasively. Overall, councils in Ireland are less powerful and perform fewer functions than in most EU countries. 14: Greece, Portugal These two former military regimes are both relatively late developers in terms of decentralising power. There are no guarantees in their constitutions that lower levels of government will be consulted on policy decisions, so the emphasis is on the local authorities to make their voices heard. This means that their opinions often carry little weight in Athens and Lisbon. · Graham Welch is media and information officer for the Local Government International Bureau."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2002/nov/13/houseofcommons.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-13T16:39:26Z","webTitle":"Tories deride lack of 'bold reforms'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/13/houseofcommons.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/nov/13/houseofcommons.uk","fields":{"headline":"Tories deride lack of 'bold reforms'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Queen's speech failed to produce any of the \"bold reforms\" promised by the prime minister, Iain Duncan Smith told MPs today. Opening debate on the legislative programme, the opposition leader said it was the \"same old story\" of higher taxes failing to produce any improvement in the country. He said: \"The prime minister has said that the government is 'at our best when we are boldest'. \"We waited for evidence of this in the Queen's speech, but the truth is that each year they promise bold measures and each year it's the same old story. \"They promise bold reforms and they fail to deliver. The one thing this government and the chancellor is delivering are higher taxes. Taxes have risen by over £100bn since 1997 - by £38 per person per week. \"Taxes on pensions, on petrol, mortgages and marriages, cars and congestion, houses and now higher education. \"From next April, National Insurance contributions will rise by £8bn a year. \"This from a prime minister who said before 1997 - 'we have no plans to raise taxes at all'. \"Five years on, Britain has overtaken Germany in the high tax league. We are paying the taxes but so much is getting worse.\" In his first attempt at one of parliament's biggest set piece speeches, Mr Duncan Smith said the CBI believed the economy had been \"almost run into the ground\". Speaking to a packed Commons chamber hours after the Queen announced the legislative package for the coming session, he gave a conditional welcome to several measures. New emergency planning legislation was \"timely and sensible\" in the wake of recent terror attacks, such as in Bali, which had proved that terrorists could strike \"any time, anywhere\". Furthermore, Britain was a \"prime target\". Mr Duncan Smith went on to say that protecting the country from attack was \"the most critical issue facing the life of our nation\", and pledged to continue to give the Tories' \"fullest support\". He said the opposition was \"immensely pleased\" that a new UN resolution on Iraq had been passed, saying Saddam had \"run out of places to hide\". It was the job of the opposition to ensure the government struck the right balance between security and freedom, he argued. \"We will support measures to help the security services but we will oppose vigorously any new powers to arrest and deport British citizens for activities that are not crimes here in the United Kingdom,\" he added. Tony Blair replied that Tory opposition to his programme on public services and law and order showed they were \"out of touch and backward, not so much nasty or nice, just plain simply irrelevant\". He went on: \"This Queen's speech focuses on economic stability, on the investment and reform programme in public services, on strong civic society based on rights and responsibilities and on Britain engaged in the world.\" Both leaders took the opportunity to break away from the topic of the Queen's speech to condemn tonight's fire strikes. Mr Blair said that \"no government on earth could yield to a 40% pay rise unlinked to any change\". Mr Duncan Smith urged the prime minister to let the armed forces use the modern fire equipment now sitting inside fire stations, before cheekily observing today \"was the first strike for 25 years - or since the last Labour government\". Charles Kennedy, for the Liberal Democrats, ridiculed the Tory leader for rebelling so often against closer European unity in the Maastricht debates under John Major, then setting off on a tour of Europe to discover why their public services were superior. He mocked: \"The quiet man approach has become the silent man approach.\" Focusing on the speech's law and order measures, Mr Kennedy told the Commons that although there was much in the speech that was sensible, there was \"much also that is too illiberal\". The debate was opened, as is traditional, by two humorous \"humble addresses\" - one by Labour's George Foulkes and the other by Oona King, also a Labour MP. · The Speaker, Michael Martin, today outlined the topics to be considered by MPs during the Commons debate on the Queen's speech. Tomorrow, Thursday, MPs will be debating health and pensions. Topics on Friday will be education and culture, media and sport. Next Monday MPs will discuss the economy and trade and industry. On Tuesday the debate will cover the regions, local government and transport and the environment, food and rural affairs. The house will, on the last day - Wednesday - discuss home affairs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2002/nov/13/queensspeech2002.queensspeech1","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-13T12:14:58Z","webTitle":"Full text of Queen's speech 2002","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/13/queensspeech2002.queensspeech1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2002/nov/13/queensspeech2002.queensspeech1","fields":{"headline":"Full text of Queen's speech 2002","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"My Lords and members of the House of Commons. My government's main priorities are economic stability, investment and reform in public services and a constructive foreign policy. To this end, my government will maintain sound public finances and will continue to take action to secure high levels of employment. This approach will enable my government to continue to invest in the public services, while supporting major programmes of reform on health, education, transport and crime. At the heart of my government's legislative programme is a commitment to reform and rebalance the criminal justice system to deliver justice for all and to safeguard the interests of victims, witnesses and communities. A bill will be introduced to reform sentencing arrangements and criminal procedures. Sentencing will be reformed to ensure that the punishment is appropriate for the offender. New types of sentence will be introduced to protect the public from dangerous offenders, help reduce re-offending and deal with young offenders. The bill will also allow retrials for those acquitted of serious offences where new and compelling evidence emerges. It will also simplify the rules of evidence to allow judge and jury to hear all the facts, including relevant previous convictions of a defendant. Legislation will also be introduced to reform the courts system. It will bring together magistrates' courts and the crown court to work more effectively under a single organisation. New sanctions will allow courts to enforce the payment of fines more efficiently. My government will introduce a bill to tackle antisocial behaviour that damages communities. A bill will be brought forward to modernise the laws on sexual offences and to strengthen the framework of penalties for sex offenders to protect the public. A bill will also be introduced to improve international co-operation in tackling crime, including drugs trafficking, and to modernise the arrangements for international mutual assistance to catch criminals. My government will bring forward legislation to streamline the licensing system for premises selling alcohol. This will abolish fixed opening hours and introduce a range of measures to reduce antisocial behaviour. My government will continue to modernise the delivery of healthcare based on the founding principles of the NHS. Legislation will be brought forward to devolve power and resources to frontline staff; give greater freedom to successful hospitals while increasing their accountability to local communities; and to introduce an independent health inspectorate. A bill will also be introduced to help ensure that local authorities support older people awaiting discharge from hospital. Raising educational standards remains my government's main priority for Britain's future prosperity. Secondary school reform will continue to promote opportunity and choice through greater diversity for parents and pupils. University reform proposals will be published to improve access and build on excellence. My government wants to create a welfare state based on giving people rights and responsibilities. They will pursue proposals that focus on the importance of work as part of our social security system. They will also bring forward proposals to tackle problems of truancy. A bill will be brought forward to establish a railway accident investigation branch in the light of Lord Cullen's recommendations on transport safety and reform the way railways are regulated to improve services for the public. My government will introduce a bill to modernise local government by improving the delivery of local services through better financial management and greater freedom for councils based on performance. Legislation will also be introduced to provide for the holding of referendums on the issue of regional governance in England. Legislation will be brought forward to reform the broadcasting and telecommunications industry by promoting competition and investment and giving powers to the office of communications. Measures will be brought forward to protect our environment, including legislation on the conservation and proper management of water. My government will also introduce legislation to speed up the planning system while improving the involvement of local communities. Members of the House of Commons. Estimates for the public services will be laid before you. My Lords and members of the House of Commons. In Northern Ireland, my government will continue to work closely with the political parties and the Irish government to secure the full implementation of the Belfast agreement. Legislation will be brought forward on policing in Northern Ireland. My government maintains its commitment to devolution in Scotland and Wales. A bill will be introduced to reform the provision of health services in Wales. A bill will be introduced to enable parliament to reach a conclusion on hunting with dogs. Parliament will be invited to scrutinise legislation in draft on a number of measures, reflecting the importance that my government places on pre-legislative scrutiny by parliament. Legislation in draft will be published to improve both housing standards and standards of management of private rented accommodation by landlords. Draft legislation will be published on the management of nuclear liabilities. A draft bill will also be published to reform the laws on corruption. My government looks forward to considering the report from the joint committee on House of Lords reform. Other measures will be laid before you. My Lords and members of the House of Commons. The Duke of Edinburgh and I look forward to paying a visit to Belgium next spring and to receiving the state visit of his Excellency the President of Russia next summer. My government will work for rapid progress on enlargement of the European Union, notably at next month's European Council meeting in Copenhagen. Legislation will be introduced to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the accession treaty with prospective member states. My government will make a decision on whether to recommend entry into the single currency on the basis of the assessment of the five economic tests to be completed by next June. The forthcoming NATO Summit in Prague will emphasise the alliance's continuing role as the cornerstone of Britain's national security. My government will continue work for an enlarged and even more effective NATO, enjoying a close partnership with Russia. My government will continue to play a leading role in combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which are among the most serious threats to the security of the United Kingdom and our allies. My government will continue to work with the international community to ensure the implementation of all UN security council resolutions. My government will work for rapid and effective implementation of the agreements reached at the recent World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and will focus on tackling climate change and finding new ways to meet our energy needs. My government will continue to work for a more effective global effort to reduce poverty, building on the UN millennium development goals and on progress achieved at the recent Monterrey conference on financing for development. Britain's aid budget will be increased and we will work to implement the Africa Action Plan in response to the new partnership for Africa's development. My government will work for a successful outcome to the current round of world trade negotiations that benefits industrialised and developing countries alike. My Lords and members of the House of Commons I pray that the blessing of almighty God may rest upon your counsels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2002/nov/12/iraq.brianwhitaker","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-12T02:47:01Z","webTitle":"Jordan isolates dissident town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/12/iraq.brianwhitaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/nov/12/iraq.brianwhitaker","fields":{"headline":"Jordan isolates dissident town","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jordanian authorities yesterday imposed a clampdown on reports of violence from the southern town of Maan amid fears that the Hashemite kingdom could become the first casualty of a possible war with Iraq. Army units and riot police rounded up suspects after four people, including a police sergeant, died and two dozen were injured in Sunday's clashes in Maan, a poor town of about 70,000 and a tradition of Islamist and pro-Iraqi militancy. Telephone lines to Maan were disconnected and nobody - including the media - was allowed in or out. It was reported that a total curfew had been imposed, with shops, schools and offices closed. The government version is that 15 Jordanians and 10 foreigners - believed to be Iraqis and Egyptians and described as a gang of outlaws - have been arrested, accused of arms and drug smuggling, killings, assaults and robberies as well as challenging the government and burning female students' dormitories and cars belonging to university professors. \"This has nothing to do with politics,\" said the government spokesman Mohammed Adwan. Few believe him. A security official, speaking to the Associated Press, said the operation in Maan was part of a campaign to \"put things in order before the possible war on Iraq\". There is strong public sympathy for Iraq in Jordan, as well as for the Palestinians. The main focus of the Maan operation is believed to be a banned Islamist group, Takfir wal Hijra (\"penance and exodus\"), whose alleged leader, Mohammed Ahmad al-Chalabi, was still at large yesterday. According to Jordanian police, he was being protected by members of his Bedouin tribe armed with assault rifles. Mr Chalabi has been wanted by the authorities following riots in Maan at the beginning of the year, sparked by the controversial killing of a student in police custody. The latest trouble follows the killing of a US development worker, Laurence Foley, in Amman last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2002/nov/12/law.theguardian","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-12T02:46:59Z","webTitle":"Marcel Berlins: Fat cats, ice hockey and a plug","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/12/law.theguardian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/nov/12/law.theguardian","fields":{"headline":"Fat cats, ice hockey and a plug","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just when I was starting to be persuaded that the fat cats of the bar are not motivated merely by money but are in reality decent, generous people anxious to do their bit for the greater good, up they jump to prove me severely wrong. As is becoming increasingly obvious, the bar is once again becoming a profession open only to young persons with substantial financial resources or backing from parents. Putting in the necessary years of study and training can leave a law student £25,000 in debt before he or she is able to earn a penny. Not surprisingly, many talented but penniless potential barristers can't or won't take on that financial burden. Those who run the profession are well aware of the dangers of returning to the bad old days of an elitist bar limited to the well-heeled. So they devised a scheme to raise money to help impecunious students through bar school. It is based on barristers giving up a very small percentage of their earnings, according to a sliding scale. And who has violently opposed the proposals? The rich, that's who, members of the highest earning sectors, those who do commercial and chancery work. A barrister earning £500,000 a year would pay in a mere £2,500; one earning £200,000, only £500. But that's clearly too much of a sacrifice to rescue their profession. · You may have read solicitor Keith Schilling's article in yesterday's Media section, arguing the case for his client Naomi Campbell in her privacy dispute with the Mirror. But did you know that you were reading the most influential man in the law in the whole United Kingdom? For that is what Schilling is, officially. Well, OK, not officially, but the next best thing - a survey in GQ, the men's magazine. Schilling comes in as the 68th most influential man in the country, but that is higher than any other legal chap (I exclude ex-lawyers such as Tony Blair). Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, is 75th and Lord Irvine, the lord chancellor, is 79th. The problem with their lordships is that they have visibly failed to surround themselves with enough celebrities; and they are now, by their lowly rankings, paying the price. · Here's Canada again, trying to out-do the US in litigation lunacy. A father from New Brunswick is suing the local ice hockey association on behalf of his 16-year-old son for £120,000, for psychological and punitive damages. The sports body had totally, utterly and in every way failed to award Steven Croteau the trophy for the league's most valuable player of the season. This omission, the lawsuit alleges, had caused Steven so much hurt that he had lost his love for the sport. His father points out that the boy who had been given the trophy had only scored 21 goals whereas Steven had notched up 45. Moreover, he added, Steven had been so sure of winning that he had bought a new shirt and tie to look good for the ceremony, attended by a crowd of 250. \"He was just humiliated,\" said papa. I trust that the example set by this case will open up a whole new legal specialism - losers' law. Just think. Every year five losing Booker finalists, several hundred unsuccessful applicants for QC, thousands of football players not picked for their first teams; all of them, to a man and woman, bearing deep psychological scars requiring compensation massage. · Under the law, every regular columnist for a broadsheet newspaper is entitled to the occasional shameless plug. Here's mine. I've co-written a play, Best of Motives, with the theatre director Lisa Forrell, which is having its British - indeed world - premiere this coming Sunday evening - a dramatised reading for one night only, for charity. The theme of the play will not be unfamiliar to readers of this column. It is all about the way our anti-terrorism laws could be used to subvert the very values they are supposed to protect. In the US, post-September 11, the obsession with the \"war on terrorism\" has resulted in the abandonment of basic constitutional principles on which the state was founded - due process, the rule of law etc. We havn't gone quite that far here, but Best Of Motives suggests that here, too, huge injustices can be done in the name of anti-terrorism. The plot centres around a Muslim youth who is accused of terrorist murder and finds himself trapped in a legal maze. It is on at the Tricycle Theatre in London (box office 020 7328 1000).

Detractors have pointed out that as a fictional character he doesn't qualify as a Great Briton, but Potter's champions insist that this does not matter because he really is really real really. 2.

She's been climbing steadily since Trevor's death, but as the only soap star in the top 10, some feel she may have peaked too early. 5. Diana, Princess of Wales.

He said the government was preparing for military action against Iraq. However, asked whether British troops would go in without a fresh UN security council resolution, he replied: \"It depends on the circumstances.\" Mr Hoon was speaking on BBC1's On the Record programme where he made it clear that although military commanders were drawing up contingency plans for British troops to go to war against Iraq, their mobilisation to the Gulf was not imminent. He indicated that a decision by the prime minister to give the go-ahead for British troops to build up a presence in the Gulf would await Saddam Hussein's response to the UN resolution agreed by the security council on Friday. That resolution states that the council would meet to discuss reports of breaches by the Iraqi leader but it does not say who would decide whether he should face the \"serious consequences\" which he is threatened with. \"That's not a matter that will be done casually, it's a matter that will be done as a result of a serious discussion in the security council,\" Mr Hoon said. But he refused to respond to the insistence by Clare Short, the international development secretary, that it was for the UN security council alone to decide whether or not force should be used. Ms Short told Channel 4 News on Friday that if President Saddam failed to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors, \"the security council will decide what kind of action needs to be taken\". Yesterday Mr Hoon said: \"It is always a matter for individual member states as it is for the United Kingdom to determine whether or not force will be used. It is a decision of the British prime minister to commit British troops.\" However, he said it would be wrong to \"belittle the [UN] process\". A senior defence source said last night: \"The last thing we want is for Saddam Hussein to say, 'Look, you have just changed the ground rules'.\" The government was \"weighing up the impact\" of an announcement that British troops were being mobilised, he said. Military commanders are drawing up plans for a British force of about 15,000 troops backed up by some 5,000 naval and air force personnel. The US has told Britain it would like it to provide special forces, and refuelling and reconnaissance aircraft. However, defence sources say the government would want to provide a much more visible force, including Challenger 2 battle tanks. • The bishop of London, Richard Chartres, said yesterday that military action in Iraq could be justified if weapons inspectors uncover evidence of a threat from President Saddam. But he stressed that any use of force must be carried out with the backing of the international community."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2002/nov/10/pressandpublishing.business1","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-10T12:00:05Z","webTitle":"Peter Preston: Scandal fans read and run","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/10/pressandpublishing.business1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2002/nov/10/pressandpublishing.business1","fields":{"headline":"Scandal fans read and run","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"That strange noise you hear is the sound of liberal teeth gnashing. They could be grinding over the result of America's mid-term elections. ('Dammit, he's good,' wrote the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland of George W Bush.) But the biggest din, as usual, is reserved for the dramatic efforts of our tabloid press - and for what the butler saw. Dumbing down? It's the theme song of this media age, loftily resisted by editors of posher papers. ('The Times is not a \"dumb\" newspaper,' according to its new supremo, Robert Thomson, 'but, for many years, has been adding layers of intelligent comment while eschewing the elitism that can be so personally satisfying for well-fed editors.') Quite so. Yet a little homely honesty works wonders. Whatever 'dumb' means as coins chink across a newsagent's counter, the Legions of the Lost IQ have had a wonderful couple of weeks. Nobody challenges the Mirror's first-day sales of their Paul Burrell exclusive: up a clear 330,000, almost 19 per cent - with hopes of adding 1 million extra when Piers Morgan's £300,000 investment has run its course. More telling, though, are the leftover calculations from Ulrika and the TV man who may, or may not, have done her wrong. When names were named, the middle-market Mail and Express both added an instant 200,000 or so sales. The Mirror claims to have been running 50,000 copies extra through the days of Deayton's dismissal. News of the World got a 120,000 lift from the plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham, only 10,000 less than from its pictures of 'John ...Who?' snorting unidentified white substances. Have I got desultory news for you? Dishing the dirt still shifts copies. Contrast all that with the October circulation figures for the daily broadsheets. They are, to put it gently, unexciting. The Guardian and the Times fell back marginally, the Telegraph sliding even further. Tories in continuing turmoil? Birt's BBC days remembered? Brown ponders black hole for Treasury revenues? Forget it. Even the Edwina effect didn't linger for long. And the lessons beyond provide very little for liberal comfort. The old red top tabloids may be in long-term decline, selling over 2m fewer copies through the week and nearly four million fewer on Sundays than they did 20 years ago, but they can still stage spectacular surges when the story and marketing fit snugly. Put a BBC block on naming Ulrika's former friend and the impact is electric. The nation nips out to find out about 'John... Who?'. Put such a TV star as Deayton through the grinder and there's a paper-chasing reader response. Put a Pakistani doctor in the boot of Paul Burrell's car heading for Kensington Palace, and your £300,000 is money superbly well spent. The key is the way that television and newspapers combine, bat off each other and reinforce demand for each other. The keys of the kingdom arrive when the great royal soap springs another surprise the broadcasters can't ignore. Four ITN lead stories day after day have a momentum of their own. Who, in such circumstances, needs to buy expensive ads? The news is all you need. It would be nice, perhaps, if the brute facts of media life were otherwise, if virtue were its own high-minded reward. But virtue is in scarce supply this autumn. We may deplore the sleaze, but we fall prey fast to the laws of curiosity, supply and demand - and we buy it in our millions. The editors we sniff about so loudly seem to know their business. They have a fix on the news agendas that work for them because experience - in terms of copies sold from scandal to scandal - is the shrewdest tutor. It isn't the dumbing down that depresses. It is the simple thought that, on the evidence, we may actually be dumber in our TV-watching, newspaper-buying choices. What's depressing is that nothing is Murdoch's fault or Greg Dyke's fault. We have just run out of excuses for ourselves. Of course, there is nothing really simple here. News consumers don't operate in little, unrelated boxes. The Princess Di who lectured leading editors about land mines was also dispatching her faithful Burrell to buy porn mags for Wills. News of the World has more ABC1 (highly-educated) readers than any other Sunday. Daily Mail has almost as many ABC1s as the Times and Telegraph combined. The Mail on Sunday has four times more A class readers than the Independent on Sunday. Out of their little boxes, 19,000 Financial Times readers also read the Mail, as do more than 10,000 Guardian readers. The major balloons in circulation come not from somebody buying a copy or two in isolation, but from adding the Mirror or Sun to their existing pile of purchases. The vital question is what happens when the balloons subside. Do readers stick with Piers and his new, upmarket pitch? Do they go back to the FT or the Sun (which, down more than 3 per cent, missed out on October's excitements)? Do they go to sleep until the next rocky horror show? And the trouble, well witnessed by October's overall sales figures, is that they twist rather than stick. For all the moments of triumph, the super stories and pulsating tales, the rest of the month was pretty dismal. Morgan may be having his week of glory, but the days before that were a desert, with Mirror sales down by more than 5 per cent in a year. The Mail may have had its blonde Swedish temptress, but the weeks without her (and with Tony Benn's diaries) were grey: sales were down 2.8 per cent in a year, and 1.7 per cent on September's. The Sunday Mirror and the People fell off cliffs of 5 per cent and 6 per cent again. The sudden wonders, in short, have a habit of ceasing. They're great when they're happening, but then they fade. They aren't habit forming. Wham, bang, thank you, ma'am, but we won't be back. We are readers, you see, and therefore all too human. We snoop and goggle and sneak away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/nov/09/biography.highereducation","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-09T00:41:03Z","webTitle":"Review: Anthony Burgess by Roger Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/09/biography.highereducation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/nov/09/biography.highereducation","fields":{"headline":"Kingdom of the wicked","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anthony Burgess by Roger Lewis 400pp, Faber, £20 Once upon a time, an Ambitious Young Man honeymooning in Gozo fell in love with the work of a Famous Living Author. OK, Gozo is a small island, and there wasn't much to do except read, but this was, the AYM thought, a genuine passion. Back in England, the AYM wrote to the FLA, proposing a biography. A special relationship developed, as between idol and idolator. But then calamity struck. The young man grew middle-aged and fell out of love. What had seemed sophisticated and worldly in the FLA he now found merely vulgar; what had seemed broad and generous, narrow; what had seemed heroically individual, \"pathetic\". It was like a holiday romance gone wrong. Undaunted, he stuck to his task, even when the FLA became an FDA. And slowly the biography he'd begun as a doting epistle became a poison-pen letter instead. That is the story behind this book, two decades in the making, the story of how Roger Lewis fell for, then grew to detest Anthony Burgess. \"It's a double story,\" he tells us. \"How I was then; how I am now, aware of lost opportunities, lost time... My need to know about Burgess 20 years ago: what lack or absence in me was being compensated for?\" Readers expecting a straightforward Life of Anthony Burgess may find this a touch self-absorbed. But good books have been written about literary fandom - Nicholson Baker on John Updike, Julian Barnes on Flaubert, Geoff Dyer on DH Lawrence - and Paul Theroux wrote entertainingly about ceasing to be a fan of VS Naipaul. Couldn't Lewis on Burgess be equally interesting? Perhaps. But in the event, the biographer fails to address his own question (\"what lack or absence in me?\"), and all failings are firmly attributed to the biographee, variously dismissed in the Prologue as lubricious, sentimental, callous, superficial, crapulous, arcane, laborious, sanctimonious and \"essentially a fake\". Lewis is still trying to be polite at this stage. Later, he lets himself go a little: Burgess, he says, is a \"lazy sod\", \"pretentious prick\" and \"complete fucking fool\". The vigour in the writing - and Lewis, give him his due, has a way with the demotic - stems from a kind of petulant, triumphal vindictiveness. My man dun tell me lies! That's the theme-tune, sung in tones of mock-outrage and injured piety. Burgess, you'd have thought, gave due warning about the fictionalising: the version of his life put forward in his memoirs was pretty obviously exaggerated and distorted for dramatic (and sometimes comic) effect. Still, having served his 20-year Life sentence, Lewis wants to set the record straight. So the famous story of Burgess's father coming home in 1919 to find him chuckling in his cot while his mother and sister lay dead from 'flu isn't strictly true, he reports: the death certificates show they actually died four days apart - which is worth knowing, but can't have made the loss any less traumatic. The equally famous story of Burgess being told by doctors, in 1959, that he had no more than a year to live is no less a fairy story, Lewis suggests - not that he has medical records to prove it, but certain remarks by Sir Roger Bannister, \"who trepanned the Burgess cranium\", allow him to infer that the inoperable brain tumour was a \"yarn\". He also questions the paternity of the only child Burgess claimed to have fathered, born to the woman who'd later become his second wife, the \"dumpy\" Liana. \"I have before me a Certified Copy of an Entry of Birth for Paolo-Andrea,\" Lewis announces in his best Sherlock Holmes voice, and reveals that the named father was a schoolteacher called Roy Lionel Halliday. It would be a turn-up if every father named on a birth certificate were the biological father, and Lewis has neither tracked down anyone called Halliday nor disproved the likelihood of Burgess having had an affair with Liana while still married to his first wife Lynne. But he claims Burgess couldn't have sired a child because he was impotent. His chief source for the impotence theory is Moyna (later Lady) Morris, who also told him that she never went to bed with Burgess. So how would she know? Lewis doesn't pause to ask himself such questions. He's too busy enumerating Burgess's other sins. Racism and xenophobia (though he wrote approvingly of other cultures and spent most of his life abroad). Paedophiliac and incestuous impulses (if he'd had daughters, he'd have pounced on them, Lewis assures us). Most intriguing of all, espionage - which didn't just mean spying on his Malayan neighbours but working for MI5 in London and liaising with the CIA. The espionage theory comes courtesy of a \"retired security official\", who approached Lewis and told him A Clockwork Orange is full of secret code-names and encrypted locations. Oddly enough, a retired security official once told me the same story. Perhaps there's something in it, but Lewis can offer no other evidence - and the likelihood of someone as voluble, indiscreet and hell-raising as Burgess being recruited by MI5 stretches credulity. Lewis none the less seems to believe that espionage made Burgess rich and was the \"dark secret haunting him\" to the end. So the charge-sheet runs on - plagiarism, sado-masochism, feckless parenting, tightness with money. One of the heaviest allegations is that Burgess neglected his first wife, Lynne, and \"was party to her destruction\" by allowing her to drink herself to death. He deserved to be eaten up with guilt, says Lewis, gallantly taking Lynne's side and tenderly quoting her niece, Ceri, who objected to the picture Burgess painted in his memoirs. Yet this is the same Lewis who delights in regaling us with Lynne's drunken antics: \"a nymphomaniacal alcoholic\", \"out of her face on shot glasses of vodka\", \"threw a pass at every male she met\", \"middle-aged, sagging and reeking of gin\", \"once you'd seen her project a stream of vomit, like the trumpet of the Archangel Gabriel, six feet across a room, you'd seen everything\". As to the claim that Lynne was attacked (and possibly raped) by four GIs during the war, Lewis is similarly brutal: \"My bet is that she fell down a manhole in Berkeley Square during the blackout when pickled.\" Can a book so abusive of its subject and those closest to him properly be called a Life? When Andrew Motion identified traces of racism, misogyny and misanthropy in Larkin, it didn't stop him admiring the poetry; whereas Lewis, charging his subject with similar incorrectnesses, doubts whether Burgess, as a writer, \"has much human relevance\". The animosity mightn't matter if he at least fulfilled his narrative obligations and gave us the facts - the when and where and which book followed the previous and what happened next. But he finds such stuff boring, and gets it over with at the outset, in a 20-page chronology and select bibliography, freeing himself to write his 400-page essay on Why I Went Off Anthony Burgess (and His Work). Character assassination makes livelier copy than hagiography. But it betrays a meaner spirit, and what's entertainingly malicious in a short article becomes tedious at book length. Possibly Lewis intended his book as an ironic, Burgessian black joke - a savage hommage. Some of his observations about Burgess's touchiness and verbosity are spot on. But the longer the book proceeds, the more preposterous the claims become: Burgess \"simply wasn't very bright\", \"he hated being a human being\". At least twice Lewis wishes Burgess dead, as if his actual death, in 1993 (described as him \"conking out\"), wasn't enough. Elsewhere, having rubbished his subject's powers of invention, he tries to impress us with his own, transcribing an imaginary dialogue from the 1960s that's unfunny and name-dropping in the extreme. Such flights of fancy might be permissible, bedded down in solid research. But there's little evidence of two decades' graft. Contemptuous of academics, because of the \"abject piss\" they write, Lewis has studiously avoided visiting the archives in Ontario, Angers and Austin, Texas, where Burgess's letters and private diaries can be found. And though he boasts of ploughing through every book Burgess wrote (\"how many have done that - except me?\"), he later admits there are several he hasn't got hold of. As to the footnotes, they're largely an excuse to pick off enemies - not only Burgess and his widow Liana (\"that frightful woman... an obscure Italian translator\"), but Stanley Kubrick (\"piss-poor\"), Clive James (\"a professional nincompoop... a prat\"), Martin Amis (\"a writer with nothing to say\"), and many more. Why devote your best years to someone you despise? Lewis has his own explanation: \"If I'm allegedly repudiating the lion of my late adolescence, it's no doubt because deep down I continue to feel close to him.\" I'd suggest another reason: he didn't like his subject from the start. Certainly his account of them meeting in May 1985 - Burgess with his \"vampiral\" red-rimmed eyes, \"unnaturally long lower teeth, the colour of maize\", and elongated upper mouth, \"like a baboon\" - doesn't suggest much initial attraction. Four months later, Richard Ellmann, Lewis's tutor, is counselling the would-be biographer to show some kindness and humility: \"I worry a little about your tone - outsmarting its subject... I'd like to feel that you were not above him patting him on the back.\" Sage advice, but it falls on deaf ears: Lewis has no more time for Ellmann (his kitchen sink \"clogged with tea leaves and his daughters' draining knickers\") than he has for Burgess. \"Burgess is like a definition of hell,\" he writes. Perhaps he thought to douse the flames by pissing on his subject. But surely the simpler thing would have been to save himself the torture. This is an idle, fatuous, self-regarding book. · Blake Morrison's latest book is Things My Mother Never Told Me"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2002/nov/08/uk.gibraltar","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-08T11:46:35Z","webTitle":"Gibraltar votes out joint rule with Spain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/08/uk.gibraltar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/nov/08/uk.gibraltar","fields":{"headline":"Gibraltar votes out joint rule with Spain","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Gibraltarians have wholeheartedly rejected British plans for their future when nearly 99% voted, via a referendum, against any deal involving shared sovereignty with Spain. Yesterday's referendum, although not legally binding on the British government, provided a huge blow to the attempts by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, to negotiate an end to the 300-year feud over the Rock with Spain. Although Spain and Britain have not yet closed a definitive deal, Mr Straw told the Commons in July that, after months of difficult talks, both sides had agreed that shared sovereignty was the best way forward. But those negotiations never included Gibraltarians or their chief minister, Peter Caruana, who said he would only take part if given the right to veto a deal he disliked. It was Mr Caruana who called the referendum and led the \"no\" campaign that triumphed so conclusively last night after 17,900 people voted against co-sovereignty and only 187 voted for it. The result was greeted last night by a cheering crowd of Gibraltarians, waving union flags, gathered in front of giant screens outside the referendum centre in John Mackintosh Hall. The referendum saw a small advance on the numbers who voted for a deal with Spain the last time round, in 1967, when only 44 people voted in favour. Participation was also down this time, with 88% of voters turning out, against 96% in 1967. The rejection comes as the UK government's policy on the future of Gibraltar was denounced as unrealistic, deplorable and representing a serious breach in accountability to parliament, in a report from the Commons foreign affairs committee. MPs concluded that the government must have known it was walking down a blind alley by agreeing to negotiate with Spain over Gibraltar. The committee concluded that the government's tactics \"had ended with the worst of all worlds - the dashing of raised expectation in Spain and a complete loss of trust in British government by the people of Gibraltar\". The report also condemned the Foreign Office's failure to confirm to parliament its offer on joint sovereignty. In a ferocious judgment representing an attack on tactics used by Mr Straw and the former Europe minister, Peter Hain, the committee, containing strongly pro-Gibraltarian Labour MPs, concluded that \"it will be a long time if ever before the concept of joint sovereignty can be made acceptable to the people or the government of Gibraltar\". The report also sides with the Gibraltarian government in its decision to boycott talks on the future of the peninsula. It calls on the government to carry out its promise to enfranchise the Gibraltar electorate in time for the European parliamentary elections in 2004. The government's effort to make the Gibraltar government legally liable to pay uprated pensions to Spanish pensioners is also described as manifestly unjust. Similarly the ban on direct military communications between Nato forces in Gibraltar and Spain should be lifted, the report says. While low-level negotiations between Spain and Britain continue, a summer deadline to reach an agreement has already gone by. Gustavo de Aristegez, Spain's ruling party's spokesman on foreign affairs, said the referendum had not been called by \"competent authorities\" and was \"not legally binding\". \"This referendum is not going to help resolve the problems of Gibraltar, the region of Gibraltar or the problems that have been facing both the United Kingdom and Spain in trying to solve this dispute that has been lasting for over 300 years,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. The Europe minister, Denis MacShane, said the result of the referendum came as \"no surprise\". \"Many on the Rock have long had serious concerns about a dialogue with Spain,\" he said. \"But the fact remains that there can be no stable future for Gibraltar while the dispute with Spain continues and important issues remain unresolved.\" Mr de Aristegez insisted that an agreement between Britain and Spain would be \"positive for Gibraltarians\" and would promote \"peaceful co-existence\". In a victory speech to Gibraltarians yesterday, Mr Caruana warned London and Madrid to ignore the voice of the people \"at their peril\". \"Fellow Gibraltarians, today we have sent a clear message to the world. One, that this is our homeland; two, that we are a people with political rights that we will not give up; and three, that those rights include the right to freely direct our own future and we will certainly not give that up,\" Mr Caruana said. Many Gibraltarians fear that joint sovereignty would lead to Spain pushing for full control. The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, said the referendum result proved joint sovereignty was now a \"dead end\". \"The vote was about the democratic expression of the wishes of the people of Gibraltar, which in this case have to be paramount. \"This was a process of attrition. They were trying to wear the people of Gibraltar down, and the people of Gibraltar last night said quite clearly we are not going to accept joint sovereignty, there is no point going on negotiating on joint sovereignty because that is a dead end. \" Three members of the Commons committee - Andrew Mackinlay, Fabian Hamilton and David Chidgey - were in Gibraltar to witness the referendum as outside observers. All three were given a standing ovation. Dr MacShane said that \"a little bit of TLC on the part of Madrid\" towards Gibraltar \"might calm things down\". \"We have to reflect on last night, reflect on the last year and try and take this forward. It's the young people of the Rock that we have to be concerned about,\" he said. \"They have got a very worrying and rather wearisome future ahead of them, and I just want to ensure that the Union Jack flies over Gibraltar but that that part of Europe starts to function normally.\" Whether the Spanish flag would be flying alongside the British flag was a matter for the people of Gibraltar, he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2002/nov/08/media.artsandhumanities","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-08T09:44:55Z","webTitle":"Great Britons contest gets personal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/08/media.artsandhumanities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2002/nov/08/media.artsandhumanities","fields":{"headline":"Great Britons contest gets personal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Screened on BBC2 and focusing on predominantly worthy historical figures, the 10-part Great Britons series seemed, at least on paper, hardly the sort of programme to set passions running high. With the exception of Diana, Princess of Wales and John Lennon, the top 10 Britons featured in the historical talent show included Elizabeth I, Churchill, Newton, Shakespeare, Cromwell, Darwin, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. All admirable contenders, but not really the type to provoke allegations of vote-rigging, blatant electioneering, and bets between the programmes' fiercely competitive presenters. And yet all this is happening. To the surprise of the BBC, the series has not only provoked viewing figures of 3 million, and sparked debate on 200 internet newsgroups, but has prompted an apparent campaign to make Brunel the winner - believed to have been influenced by Jeremy Clarkson, the ebullient presenter who made a passionate case for the engineer and has been reinforcing it through his columns in the Sunday Times. Students at Brunel University are understood to have inundated the BBC's website and phone lines after each programme to vote for their man - a move which has seen Brunel surge into the lead with 24% of the 600,000-strong vote, ahead of Diana, with 22%, Churchill, with 16%, and Darwin, with 11%. And the university has encouraged their behaviour, asking Is Brunel the Greatest Briton? at the top of its homepage and providing a link to the BBC's Great Britons site on which viewers have the chance to vote. \"We were very proud of the programme and we are very proud of our engineering tradition,\" explained Brunel's pro vice-chancellor, Steve Hodkinson. \"So we put this link on last week and we're pleased our students and quite a lot of our staff have voted.\" A BBC spokeswoman stressed that the move was entirely legitimate, adding: \"We would welcome more of this. Perhaps it would persuade science students to champion Newton or literature students Shakespeare.\" But less welcome is the multiple-voting the corporation has detected in favour of Churchill, Darwin and Shakespeare. Using a \"highly sophisticated\" method, votes have been drip-fed into the system. They have all been discounted, however, and the BBC is at pains to point out there were an insufficient amount to alter the order of the rivals. But while such vote-rigging can be detected, the BBC can do nothing to minimise the steady electioneering being conducted by the two most charismatic broadcasters of the series, Clarkson, the Top Gear presenter, and Andrew Marr, the corporation's political editor. Both men, who launched the series with the cases for Brunel and Darwin respectively, have repeatedly called on the public to vote, with Clarkson inciting readers of his Sunday Times column: \"Vote for Brunel. Please. I have a bet on with Andrew Marr.\" Marr, who wrote a Telegraph feature putting the case for Darwin, took the opportunity of punting his pick as he presented BBC Radio 4's Start the Week for the first time on Monday. Interviewing Michael Portillo he mentioned that his Great Briton, Elizabeth I, would be featured a week on Friday, but reminded voters about voting for Darwin. \"I puff my man wherever I can but always in a purely gentlemanly way,\" he explained last night. The electioneering appears to have been prompted by fierce, albeit friendly, rivalry, which saw Marr inform Clarkson, at a BBC party in May: \"I'm going to beat you,\" according to the series' producer, Mark Harrison. \"We had a gentlemanly exchange and he bet me a fiver Brunel would win and that's fine by me,\" Marr said. Less gentlemanly was the heckling that took place when Marr made a speech at the series' launch and joked about the supposed sexual inadequacy of Clarkson's hero. \"He suggested the only reason that Brunel is remembered is for having a big hat and big cigar, and that those are phallic symbols to make up for his lack on inches,\" Harrison said. \"He was vigorously heckled by Jeremy, who suggested Darwin was a plagiarist.\" Lucy Moore, who put the case for Nelson, recalled: \"There was very loud banter between the two of them. Jeremy's a very macho guy and he very much wants Brunel to win.\" Historian Tristram Hunt, who will put the case for Newton, said: \"He will be incredibly happy if Brunel wins.\" There have even been suggestions that Clarkson, who was unavailable for comment last night, may have influenced the voting - if only because, as a cult figure among students, he may have spurred Brunel students to support his icon. \"I think everyone's asking themselves what's going on,\" said Marr. \"It is a little odd Brunel's in the lead, given that all he really did is connect Bristol to the rest of the country.\" But with Brunel surging ahead of Diana, championed by former Daily Express editor Rosie Boycott, the BBC stressed the rigging had not been in favour of the engineer and that there was still plenty of room for manoeuvre. \"The programmes on Shakespeare and Churchill haven't yet been transmitted and I think the results are going to move around an awful lot in the next two weeks,\" a BBC spokeswoman said.

Subscriber numbers fell more than 5% to 1.76m in the three months ending in September as management concentrated on squeezing revenue out of existing viewers rather than attracting new customers. Managing director Charles Burdick, who took over in August when Adam Singer was ousted, said the company lost customers after raising some prices. Mr Burdick added that Telewest added more customers in October than it lost, \"so the next quarter should be very solid\". Underlying earnings increased to just over £280m in the nine months to the end of September, from £225m in the previous year. The pretax loss decreased to £400m from £600m. Sales were up 4% at just over £1bn. In September, Telewest out lined a financial restructuring which will leave existing shareholders with 3% of the company. The plan - the latest in a line of financial restructurings by former British high-fliers - calls for the group's bondholders to swap £3.5bn of its £5.3bn debt for 97% of the company. \"I think we should be out of the restructuring completely with a new balance sheet early in the new year,\" Mr Burdick said yesterday. Telewest is close to announcing a deal with its banks for a new credit facility that will fund the business until it can support itself. Most industry observers believe that once the books are in order Telewest will merge with cable rival NTL, which is due complete its own refinancing this month. \"What I have always said is that it makes sense for one cable company to compete with BT and BSkyB,\" said Mr Burdick. \"But when that is going to happen is anybody's guess.\" NTL announced yesterday that the managing director, Stephen Carter, will leave at the end of the year. While NTL said he decided to leave because the task of restructuring the business was over, insiders said he felt increasingly sidelined with the recent arrival of chief executive Barclay Knapp to lead the business in the United Kingdom. Mr Carter's name has been widely suggested as a possible candidate for the top jobs at magazine publisher Emap and newspaper publisher Trinity Mirror.

I can't think. But I can think about the abolition of the multicultural programming department of Channel 4. I was its commissioning editor from 1984 to 1997. Channel 4 was created in 1982, and adopted the useful shibboleth of multiculturalism. It only meant that someone must do something to include and embrace the (by now settled) immigrant communities. If the medium was the message, blacks and Asians must have their say - and if it was the massage, their collective ego had to be catered for. In the beginning, there were no guidelines as to what this multiplicity of culture would be. Television can take in most things and package them, and it is the medium that has uniquely stretched the word 'culture' to breaking point and possibly deprived it of all meaning. On taking the job, I knew that multiculture was in some measure a political description. The word was coined, and the programming department initiated, to make the ex-colonial populations - and more centrally Indian and Asian immigrants - feel wanted. More important than the information these programmes could impart was simply the fact that they were on screen. When I took the job, there were two magazine programmes called Black on Black and Eastern Eye, produced respectively by Trevor Phillips and Samir Shah at London Weekend Television. They were produced to the highest possible technical and artistic standards. Their journalism may have been stale, the celebrities may have been second rank ones, but that was not the point. The point was to have a dedicated and distinctly Black or Asian presence on screen. TV is often accused of trivialising, but for the multicultural population, to have their own programmes was to gain dignity. Presence and variety were the principles that governed the first set of multicultural programming, but there were other policy considerations. The first was to dissociate multicultural programming from whinging anti-racism. It was demeaning. It turned people into simple victims. The second was to recognise that British TV in its observation, investigation, probing drama and satirical bite had no responsibility to flatter its subjects. Projecting positive images was the job of advertising agencies and politicians looking for minority votes. The multicultural department was not selling blacks and Asians as ads sell soap. There are potential losses in abolishing the multicultural department, which can and did become the centre of a lot of debate and dialogue between producers, the public and the editors. The first is that the inhibiting considerations, which have been elevated to a liberal creed today, of what one can and cannot say about race, religion, people and cultures are much more likely to bedevil a white editor than a black one. Whole dimensions of truth are and can continue to be subverted by the rule that multicultural programming should be dedicated to propagandist objectives of good race relations. The other limb of this dismembered baby that may go down with the bathwater is the provision that must be made for the specifically minority interests of the ethnic population. Reggae and Rap can enter the mainstream schedules under the aegis of music in a way that qawwali music and the legendary Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan never would. Of course Asians can buy videos of qawwali recitals and of the late Nusrat and watch them in the privacy of their homes, or access a cable channel that does exclusively that, but that is not the point. The point is to have such 'culture' broadcast by a mainstream channel with consistency, to have it recognised as part, however marginal, of the discourse of the nation and moreover to expand its possibilities, to take risks beyond the pap put out by specialist cable networks. Lastly there is the 'trade union' issue, the social fairness point, that a group of companies owned or staffed by black and Asians ought to be encouraged to grow within the independent sector without compromising the quality of programming. Channel 4's own statistics demonstrate that the contracts to self-defining 'black' companies are few and far between. There has been a reversal or neglect of the bias I attempted to introduce in my time, doing the opposite of quota-setting which was looking for penetrative access or specialist knowledge of the subjects. An editorial body has to have the intimacy with the sub-cultures of blacks and Asians to be able to commission and programme with any relevance. No TV executive, whatever his or her origin, will be able to tell the intimate story of the tearaway Talibanic tendency of the Midlands perhaps, but he or she ought to know which production company and which individuals will deliver the genuine thing. Intimate knowledge of these communities is crucial if this is to happen. With this new policy of multicultural diffusion, the real challenge will be the facing of the fact that different cultures are underpinned by distinct ethics. Even though British TV has spectrum of the highbrow and the dumbed-down, there are no mainstream editors who understand and empathise with the mindset of jehadis, killers of authors and burners of books, families which force marriage contracts or polygamists (or perhaps I am mistaken about this last). Neither should there be - but with such a prohibition, one ought to accept that multiculturalism in Britain is mono-ethical. Other frames of morality can be observed but not approved of. They must inevitably be reduced to polite or critical anthropology. Even before the abolition Channel 4, ratings-led and culturally bled, ceased taking its multicultural programme remit with any seriousness. An observational documentary on Tihar Jail in Delhi made by Endboard Productions, an Asian-owned company, was assigned a very late night slot, deliberately killing its audience. The producer protested vigorously and the programme was pulled and kept in abeyance. Lahore Law, an observational series about the operation of the Sharia in Pakistani courts, revealing and relevant, though commissioned by the mainstream documentary department was bizarrely scheduled, with the first programme going out early one evening and the next two at midnight in subsequent weeks. Nevertheless, though treated with contempt by the Channel, the series has been nominated for the prestigious Grierson Documentary Award and may yet prove the point that supposedly populist scheduling can't be the arbiter of value. If it had been commissioned by a specialist editor, it may have had a champion within to argue its merits and to win it a regular, better slot. By contrast a similar series in my time as commissioning editor called Karachi Kops, an observation in a Pakistani Police station was transmitted by my programme controller at the time, Peter Salmon, at 9pm in a regular weekday slot. The risk was rewarded with very substantial viewing figures and public and critical attention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2002/nov/08/money","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-08T02:43:42Z","webTitle":"RSA aims to shrink its way out of trouble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/08/money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2002/nov/08/money","fields":{"headline":"RSA aims to shrink its way out of trouble","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Royal &amp; SunAlliance is embarking on a desperate plan for survival that will see a dramatic shrinking of its business and a 12,000 cut in its 50,000 worldwide workforce by 2004. The insurer is taking this route to avoid a £1bn cash call on its shareholders, who were reluctant to plough more money into the company. RSA was last night fighting to convince a sceptical City that it had found the way to make up a £600m shortfall in its capital position. Its shares - which have traded at more than 800p - gained 2p to end at 120p. About 5,000 jobs will be removed in the next two years from the 17,000 British workforce. These include 1,200 jobs already earmarked from the closed life insurance operation and 500 in general insurance. RSA is now cutting a further 900 jobs from the general insurance business in Britain and will transfer 2,200 through outsourcing. Other positions will be shed by spinning off the Asia Pacific operation - which employs 5,800 - through a public offering of shares and selling off the RSUI business in the United States which sells riskier insurance policies. Through the sale of these businesses and a severe £3.5bn reduction in the number of general insurance policies it writes, RSA aims to transform the shortfall in its capital position into a £700m surplus. By the end of 2004, RSA, the product of the botched merger six years ago of Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, will largely be a general insurer and have life operations only in Chile and Denmark. The plan, announced as it reported £471m of operating profits in the first nine months of 2002, comes almost a year after Bob Mendelsohn, the recently ousted chief executive, promised to find a way to raise fresh capital. Yesterday, Sir Patrick Gillam, the chairman, who is due to retire next year, admitted that the insurer had been too slow to act. \"The group's results in recent years have been disappointing. We have not executed our strategy as effectively and as quickly as we should have done.\" Julian Hance, the finance director, dismissed rumours that Sir Patrick had told a meeting of analysts that the board had been misled by the previous management as a misinterpretation of \"unfortunate wording\". He said the chairman had been trying to admit to analysts that the group had a habit of making promises before it could deliver them. Mr Hance refused to admit that RSA had been forced to embark on this break-up strategy because investors would not back a rights issue because of concern about the future strategy and exposure to asbestos liabilities. He said it was a \"happy coincidence\" that RSA had come up with an alternative plan. One analyst said: \"They've been backed into a corner\". Robin Savage, analyst at WestLB Panmure, expressed concern that the plan would take two years to implement, but said, \"We support these actions\". He set a price target for the shares of 200p. Bob Gunn, the acting chief executive, said that the results for the first nine months were showing improvement but \"still not at an acceptable level\". The main changes · The overall headcount is to be reduced by 12,000 to 38,000 by 2004 through a combination of redundancies, outsourcing and the sale of subsidiary businesses - 5,000 of those positions are in the United Kingdom; · Asian Pacific business are to be floated off and the RSUI specialist business in the United States sold - the City believes that the sale of life operations in Denmark and Chile will follow; · the amount of business underwritten in the general insurance arm will be reduced by some £3.5bn from £8.5bn at present; · the company will continue to concentrate on general insurance and pull out of life business elsewhere; · the aim is to reverse the present £600m shortfall in capital needed to continue operating into a £700m surplus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2002/nov/07/iraq.ewenmacaskill","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-07T02:07:55Z","webTitle":"How fixer Powell struck the deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/07/iraq.ewenmacaskill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/nov/07/iraq.ewenmacaskill","fields":{"headline":"How fixer Powell struck the deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"'If you're looking for a hero in all of this, there's really only one - Powell,\" a senior western diplomat at the United Nations said yesterday. He was explaining the emergence of a resolution on Iraq that appeared to have pulled off the feat of satisifying Bush administration hawks while placating the French and dragging Russia and China along behind. If, as diplomats unanimously expect, the resolution tabled yesterday is passed by the security council essentially unchanged, it will be largely down to Colin Powell. After almost two months of gruelling negotiations, the US secretary of state's balancing act on Iraq - crucially facilitated by the United Kingdom - has brought Washington a long way from its initial sabre-rattling and rescued the UN from potential irrelevance, while allowing France to boost its stature and influence on the international stage. And yet the US has conceded none of its declared right to unilaterally lead an attack on Iraq should Saddam obstruct the weapons inspectors. The tensions began to mount on September 12, when President Bush issued his challenge to the UN general assembly: \"Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?\" The UN had to pass a resolution calling for the immediate return of inspectors backed by the threat of military force, he insisted. That Mr Bush was there at all, one security council official said yesterday, was at least partly down to his personal relationship with Tony Blair. If the matter had been left to the most ideologically unwavering of the Washington hawks - Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz - the UN might not even have been consulted. It was a moment of reckoning for Mr Powell, often portrayed as a lone moderate - and an opportunity for him to prove the wisdom of his multilateralist instincts. The chasm that would need to be crossed became clear the day after Mr Bush's speech, at a lunch in New York attended by foreign ministers representing the five permanent members of the UN security council. There, the French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin first raised the demand for two resolutions: one sending inspectors back in, and a second authorising military action only once Iraq had been given the chance to comply. That would tie Washington's hands unacceptably, the White House said. Mr Powell and Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, discussed how to find a compromise. If Mr Powell pushed for a tough resolution, placating the hawks, he risked losing the support of the Russian, French and Chinese - the other veto-wielding council members - and erasing the UN from the picture. If he opted for one that was too soft, he would lose his administration's support. It was soon established that the UK negotiating team would play the central role in mediating between the US and the \"sceptical three\". Mr Powell began speaking to Jack Straw almost every day and frequently also to Mr de Villepin. The wrangling continued for a month. Russia pushed for \"light at the end of the tunnel\" - carrots, rather than sticks, promising Iraq an end to sanctions, for example, if it cooperated. Then, on October 11, Congress voted to give Mr Bush the right to wage war on Iraq. The next day, with the hawks assuaged, Mr Powell, at the UN, offered the first glimmer of an American willingness to compromise. \"That was the big moment of the negotiations,\" one of the diplomats involved said. Apparently working with an idea originating among British negotiators, Mr Powell began to hint at the possibility of a two-stage resolution that would commit the US to consulting the security council before it went to war, but not, in his words, letting the council \"handcuff\" the administration by making action dependent on a new resolution. Nitpicking By October 29, the negotiations were also deeply enmeshed in linguistic nitpicking. The US and Britain wanted to declare Iraq to be in material breach of past resolutions; France accepted that Iraq had been in material breach in the past, but feared the present tense could be a trigger for war. France wanted the resolution to warn that Iraq \"may\" face serious consequences; the US wanted the word \"will\". Mr Powell told Mr de Villepin it was time to make a decision, and the US and UK spoke last week about bringing the matter to a head by forcing a vote. At the last minute, though, they decided to keep talking with the French. But the Russian envoy at the UN, Sergey Lavrov, stuck to his firm opposition, insisting on a fully-fledged commitment to a second resolution, but some council members doubted he was communicating Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin's own views accurately. Telephone talks between Mr Bush and Mr Putin were postponed because of the Moscow hostage crisis. The US mid-term elections - and the wedding of Mr Powell's daughter last weekend - were expected to force further delays. But Russia's reluctant compliance - or at least its refusal to veto - seemed assured by last Friday when Mr Straw, speaking from his Blackburn consituency, had a conversation about the latest wording with Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister. Mr Powell and Mr Ivanov spoke too, and yesterday European diplomats said Moscow would have no choice but to comply if France did. And France will, it seems. Paris is convinced that its long effort to hunt down and weed out any hidden \"green lights\" for military action has paid dividends. Its bottom line throughout was that the objective of a resolution should be the return of inspectors, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. Even if further minor amendments to the text are made, President Jacques Chirac will not get everything he wanted, and almost certainly not a second resolution. But he has made his stand. \"He's played it extremely cleverly,\" one western diplomat in Paris acknowledged. Mr Powell, meanwhile, spared no energies in continuing his role as a mediator between the hawks and doves. With France on board, it was time to attend to his critics in the Pentagon. America would show zero tolerance if Iraq hesitated to submit to the resolution, he told journalists on Monday. \"Some can argue it can take months ... for the inspectors to look at everything they want to look at, but we will know early on whether or not Iraq is intending to cooperate,\" he said then. \"That is the real test for Iraq.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2002/nov/05/publicvoices","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-05T00:11:01Z","webTitle":"'Let retired UK officers retain their warrant cards, as they do in Spain'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/05/publicvoices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2002/nov/05/publicvoices","fields":{"headline":"'Let retired UK officers retain their warrant cards, as they do in Spain'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The British government is rightly proud that it is increasing the number of police officers. At the same time, however, around 3,000 police officers retire each year from the service, having completed the standard full term of 30 years. These officers hand in their police warrant card and are, to all intents and purposes, lost to the police service even though they may be 10 or 15 years or so away from the usual retirement age in other occupations. Not long ago our website received an email from a retired officer suggesting that \"consideration should be given to allowing retiring officers to retain their warrant cards and powers so that they can act when, as 'ordinary citizens', they come across something needing the presence of a police officer. This already is accepted practice in Spain and works well. Officers could then also volunteer in an emergency.\" We already knew from talking to officers approaching retirement that officers about to retire from the police were often reluctant to part from their warrant card, it being something they get used to carrying over 30 years. So we thought we'd put the question in one of our weekly email newsletters. Most of those responding were supportive of this suggestion. \"It really is about time the government and the police service cashed in on retired members, though only if the member so wished. Warrant cards could be stamped with 'retired' as I believe they do in some states in the USA. Without some form of official identification, these days you are asking for trouble if you start implementing the law without it. Just think how many more trained 'policemen' they would have.\" \"I think this is an excellent idea. This would certainly be an asset at times where a little more official power would be of help.\" \"What an excellent idea. I would be prepared to get involved more if I had the protection of a warrant card, because now you are 'nobody' if you witness any thing, and the people of today would just laugh if you intervened as a private individual.\" \"In most states of America it is common policy when an officer retires his or her warrant card or badge is stamped retired, yet he or she still retains the powers of a police officer or deputy. As most police officers are not just in it for the money, but are of a certain type of person, they would needless step in when required to do so, and the comfort of the warrant card in the pocket would help.\" \"A friend in the USA tells me a similar thing works there and they can 'hold' a suspect until the real guys attend. Sounds good to me.\" \"This seems a good idea. Having been retired for 14 months I am still approached by people in my community who have concerns, questions or merely want advice. Carrying identification could well help in certain situations if used sensibly.\" \"I bet there are plenty of retired bobbies who would gladly go on to a 'reserve' list so that they could be called back to give a hand for big searches, major incidents, and so on.\" \"As 'most' police officers retired or not are of the type to 'get involved' with whatever is going on, the retention of a warrant card would at least give some status when necessary.\" \"What a good idea! It won't suit everyone, but a lot of young 49ers retire when they reach the 30-year mark and are still active, fit and full of beans, It's not an easy transition from 'power-wielding PC' to 'civvy' and resisting the temptations to act as an officer, suddenly realising that you do not have any authority or powers. A lot of Specials do exactly that. Carry a warrant card and act when required, all unpaid. What's the difference - apart from the level of professionalism? Who says it's compulsory? I would certainly consider it. It's very difficult switching off a lifetime's habits. It would help me through the transition for sure.\" \"I think it makes good sense for retired police officers to retain their warrant cards. There is a lot of wasted skills and experience out there.\" \"Seems to be a reasonable idea. It would, though, have to be a matter of choice. Also there are many instances which occur that need the presence of an officer in uniform to be able to conduct necessary arrests; however, we could have enabling detention powers. Certainly worth examining as there is a vast pool of experience out there which should not be lost just because of a retirement date. Surely retirement means from full-time or part-time work; a chip is not removed from the officer's brain.\" \"This has to be one of the best ever ideas. I am not suggesting financial reimbursement for carrying out police duties. But it has to make sense for a retired officer, who knows (or ought to) the law, to be able to perform his former function. The lack of officers on the streets at present is awful. I wouldn't mind having my warrant card back!\" \"I know a lot of retired officers would absolutely hate the idea, but I for one would have been glad on a couple of occasions over the last year to have been able to produce some form of ID which would prove who I was. At the end of the day, if you don't produce it you can sail on by . . .\" \"The production of a badge by a plain clothes cop retired or serving, can have a very sobering effect on wrongdoers who assume that a cop is not around when they play up.\" \"A damn good idea - I will retire in four years and would relish retaining the 'powers of a constable' for as long as I am fit enough. There would have to be an age limit/medical for those wishing to retain the powers, but think of the advantage to the service with hundreds of retiring police officers preserving the peace? This would be better than forces trying to attract officers back after reaching retiring age.\" There were, however, a minority who demurred. \"No thanks, enough is enough.\" \"The police receive little or no support from 'the system' as it is. What chance would a civilian carrying a warrant card have?\" \"This government already wants policing on the cheap. This system would only add to the growing pile of stuff that gives them more reason to avoid paying for a proper service.\" \"Sorry, but you're either a police officer or you're not. A warrant card is not required to carry out a 'citizen's arrest'.\" \"Not likely - further policing on the cheap. Having done a full 30 years, with a good sickness record, the nicest thing I find about retirement is being able to walk away from situations and not ruin a good holiday/night out/shopping trip by feeling obliged to become involved. No thank you. I'm now an ordinary citizen and let's keep it that way.\" \"Sounds like those who spent their times in the office are regretting not getting out more! Those of us that used our powers out on the street until the bitter end are glad to relinquish them. I am 49 years of age and was on uniformed patrol on my last day of work. If I had wanted to keep my warrant card, I would have exercised my right to stay a police officer for another six years. I now have better things to do with my life than sort out other peoples' disputes, go to court all day only to be told I am not required, turn up at court to find the defendant has been excused, and all the rest of the rubbish thrown up over 30 years. Those people who still wish to provide a service, can indeed do so. All they have to do is ensure they know the rights and responsibilities of a citizen and they will find they are already empowered to do quite a lot. Don't expect any support when things go wrong, though, and don't expect anyone to be interested when you are injured.\" There are around 150,000 serving police officers in the United Kingdom, and around 150,000 retired police officers. Even if only some of the retired group were to be prepared to carry a \"retired officer\" warrant card, it could still provide a significant increase in the police presence in local communities. Certainly food for thought for the home secretary. - Bernard Rix is editor of www.offduty.co.uk, whose focus is the community of serving and retired police officers.

From time to time, however, the unthinkable actually happens. When he was the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII gave evidence in court in two celebrated civil cases. Meanwhile, the current Princess Royal has been summonsed to appear before East Berkshire magistrates this month on charges relating to a dangerous dog. Rare though they are, these cases are a confirmation of the noble words of Thomas Fuller, some three centuries ago: \"Be you never so high, the law is above you.\" Those words were famously recalled by the late Lord Denning when he ruled against a Labour attorney general a quarter of a century ago. But, as Lord Denning was careful to point out at the time, they applied only to those whom the law defines as subjects. As the Burrell case forcefully exposed, they do not apply to the sovereign whose subjects, for legal purposes, we all are. For the Queen herself to appear as a witness (still more as a defendant) in a case brought in her name raises a practical absurdity, especially if she is a witness for the defence. So the question that the Burrell case raises is whether that historic legal immunity of the sovereign should any longer apply. Our view is that it most definitely should not. On some occasions in the past, this newspaper has been heavily patronised by certain monarchist \"constitutional experts\" for daring to suggest that it was time to rethink the powers and privileges of the crown in the modern world. So it is good to be able to acknowledge that some of these same experts have been actually setting the pace for change over the weekend. Lord Blake, who is not a man with an extensive record of aligning with radical causes, says after the Burrell case that the Queen's role should be reconsidered. In future, as in other jurisdictions (the case of United States v Nixon leaps to mind), cases could be brought by the United Kingdom, or even - shock, horror - by the People. When a case makes the law look an ass, it is time to reconsider the law. The law commission should now examine the subject, and the Commons public administration committee should pursue it too. Just because this case involves the sovereign is no reason for the law not to be changed. Quite the contrary, in fact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2002/nov/04/politicalcolumnists.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-04T01:07:18Z","webTitle":"Peter Preston: National majorities have rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/04/politicalcolumnists.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2002/nov/04/politicalcolumnists.comment","fields":{"headline":"National majorities have rights","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is probably the most visceral question of our times, asked from Chechnya to Kashmir to Armagh and often answered in blood. But the odd thing is that, no matter how many times he hears it, no matter how many times he witnesses its consequences, Tony Blair never quite gets the point. Indeed, he, John Prescott and Robin Cook still troop around blank-faced, offering the question up on a plate. As though it were panacea, not potential poison. What do the Chechens, with their bombs and their kidnappers, want? They want to live in a free little country of their own - not as a runt in the litter of Russia's federation. What do the Kashmiris, with their bombs and murderous attacks, want? They want to be free of the Indian federation (and possibly of Pakistani ambition, too). And the Kurds, the Tamils, the Corsicans and Kosovans? Wherever you look, wherever you go, there are minorities buried within bigger countries demanding autonomy. But the bigger countries - thank you President Putin - are saying: \"No.\" Not maybe; not perhaps, one fine day; just no. Their no is the voice of the majority. Minorities have rights. Majorities have the last word. But in Britain, though we seldom pause to reflect on it, there is another way that gives minorities the last word - and majorities not so much as a word in edgeways. Do Scotland or Wales wish to elect their own parliaments? All they have to do is win a referendum first. The done devolution deal. Does Northern Ireland wish to remain a part of the UK, or join with Dublin? A referendum for Northern Irish voters lies constantly open. All republicans have to do to leave is win, and then push off. And - whisper it gently - the same formula lies there for the Scots and the Welsh one day. It seems so obvious, so normal. Mr Cook at the weekend was peddling regional assemblies for anyone who calls. Mr Prescott sells elected mayors like cans of beans. But in fact this seeming normality is rather remarkable; and perhaps remarkable folly. Tony Blair's biggest mate in Europe, Jose Maria Aznar, would certainly think so. Other democratic countries' byzantine struggles against their own minorities tend not to make newspaper headlines here. They are complex, introverted tales. Spain follows events in Northern Ireland closely, because it hears eerie echoes - but London doesn't linger long over the tumult in Bilbao or Barcelona. Nevertheless, there is reason to linger. Britain long ago offered Gibraltar a referendum to ratify or reject a change in its status should London and Madrid ever seek to negotiate one. Because Aznar and Blair are pals, those negotiations have taken place. Because sovereignty can be shared, that is the preferred solution. But 30,000 Gibraltarians want nothing to do with it. They have their referendum - and other Iberians have suddenly taken up the same cry. We'll hold our own vote in a couple of years, says Juan Jose Ibarretxe, president of the Basque country's ruling PNV. Give us a loose association with Madrid plus a place in the European Union and there's a peaceful way out for everyone. Hey, and if they're doing that, says Arturo Mas, the new leader of Catalonia's nationalists, we'll want a better deal, too. What's sauce for Gibraltar's goose is suddenly the sauce of separatism across much of northern Spain. It is a thick stew of politics, with some parallels - the banning of Batasuna, the Basques' Sinn Fein; the goal of \"freedom\" within the EU - and some important differences, including a tradition of terror attacks to make the IRA seem wimps. But the most important difference of the lot is Madrid's stubborn antipathy to capitulation. Why should a minority be able to decide the fate of a nation without reference to the majority that surrounds and supports it? Where is the fairness or democracy in that? There's the vexatious question. Majorities have rights, too. They want their country kept whole, for fear of wholesale disintegration. So they need a specific voice in deciding its future, just as Aznar demands a voice that represents the interests of all Spaniards, not just Spain's richest, most disaffected regions. But this is curiously not the current British instinct. Want to bale out of a disunited kingdom? Sure: carry on. Want a block on progress to any solution? Sure: the Gibraltarians have it, whatever the wider British interest. Want a fatter range of subsidies from the centre as your price for staying on board? Sure: that is the precise Prescott-Cook formula for introducing more regional assemblies. If the north-east (say) fancies some of the same boodle as Scotland and Wales, then it need only vote to get it. From Middlesbrough to Hartlepool you can even get your oddball elected mayor if you tick the right box. Yet the people who pay for that decision, who have to live with this jigsaw system, are never asked the question square on. We don't get a national referendum to sanctify the process; we are pushed aside. Stand back and ponder the illogic here. Northern Ireland lapses bad-temperedly into direct rule again. But the direct rulers - us - have damn-all say in what happens next. We merely hold the punchbag. A Gibraltar settlement? No dice. A decent accounting of devolution? No way. A local government framework that offers coherence? Sadly not. More elected mayors to re-charge voting turn-outs? Alas, look at Switzerland, with its constant compartmentalisation and referendums. And don't bother to guess which European country has the lowest voting levels of the lot. What sounds so reasonable can be a recipe for stagnation and fissiparous impotence. A switch-off, not a turn-on. The question is itself a stinker because we gave away the answer long ago. p.preston@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2002/nov/03/features.magazine27","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-03T01:00:00Z","webTitle":"Let us spray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/nov/03/features.magazine27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2002/nov/03/features.magazine27","fields":{"headline":"Let us spray","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Anxious about an important meeting? Nervous about turbulence when flying? Feel the tell-tale signs of premenstrual syndrome creeping on? Never mind about popping pills or talking cures, scientists in America believe the answer to our problems could be right under our noses. Researchers in California claim they have discovered a completely novel method of taking medicines using a 'sixth sense' which they believe humans possess in common with most animals. Scientists at the drugs-development company Pherin Pharmaceuticals have invented nasal sprays designed to deliver a powerful but odourless hormone direct to the brain. Rather than acting on our sense of smell, the compound contains synthetically produced pheromones - scentless chemical substances which are said to transmit mood-altering messages to the brain via a little-known organ inside the nose. If it works, the innovation could provide instant, safe and effective relief for a range of conditions which have long confounded doctors, including premenstrual syndrome (PMS), depression, panic attacks, social phobia and anorexia nervosa. Clinical trials on the PMS spray, called PH80, have already begun and could lead to the first pheromone-based medicine available on prescription in America by 2004 and Europe soon after. Treatments for panic attacks, anxiety disorders and appetite problems are likewise in the pipeline and we could eventually see anti-depressants, contraceptives and fertility aids, all based on pheromones. Doctor David Berliner, the founder of Pherin Pharmaceuticals, believes the new drugs have huge potential. Since the compounds are transmitted directly to the brain, they act almost instantaneously and, as they never enter the bloodstream, they produce no side-effects, he says. Sounds too good to be true? Many fellow scientists certainly think so. Researchers working in the same field both here and in the US detect more than a whiff of hype. Oxford University zoologist Dr Tristram Wyatt, who is an expert on pheromones in animals, confesses himself 'deeply sceptical' that pheromones will produce medicines for humans in the near future. 'Smell is important to humans, but we are a long way from using smell medicine as a treatment,' says Dr Wyatt, author of a forthcoming book, Pheromones and Animal Behaviour, due to be published by Cambridge University Press next month. Scientists generally agree that most mammals, from mice to elephants, can communicate with others of the same species by emitting hormones from special glands. These pheromones can influence animal behaviour when they are sensed by the vomeronasal organ, located inside the nose, which then transmits messages to the brain. 'There is no doubt that animals of all kinds use pheromones,' concedes Dr Wyatt. 'It is probably the most widely used means of communication across the whole animal kingdom, including mammals, fish and insects.' Researchers have long speculated that humans, too, may communicate at subconscious levels using pheromones. The notion has inspired fantasies about love potions which make their wearers irresistible. It is even possible to buy pheromone-based perfumes on the internet that claim to 'dictate sexual behaviour and attract the opposite sex'. But firm evidence of human pheromones only emerged four years ago, when an American study demonstrated that odourless substances swiped from women's armpits and applied to the noses of other women could alter the recipients' menstrual cycles and timing of ovulation. Theoretically, this discovery could lead to pheromone-based contraceptives. So far, so promising. However, research projects such as these have their detractors. While Dr Wyatt concedes that humans probably do emit pheromones, he is not convinced that we possess a functioning vomeronasal organ (VNO) which sends messages to the brain. 'I would love us to have one,' he says. 'But so far the evidence is that we don't.' Anatomists have located tiny pits in the human nasal cavity where the VNO may exist, but so far have failed to detect any nerve connections linking the area to the brain. Experiments claiming to show electrical activity between the VNO and the brain, conducted by researchers at Pherin and elsewhere, have been inconclusive, says Dr Wyatt. This does not make it impossible to develop pheromone medicines activated by smell. But technically, Dr Wyatt believes, that is a long way off. 'It is the Holy Grail,' he says. 'It is perfectly possible we will eventually use pheromones for treatment but we are just at the beginning.' Dr Nick Neave, an evolutionary psychologist at Northumbria University, is less dismissive. Experiments that he has conducted with colleagues have convinced him that humans do possess an active VNO and that pheromones can influence, if not change, human behaviour. In one laboratory study, published this year, Dr Neave and colleagues asked 32 women to rate the attractiveness of four men based on photographs and descriptions. When the women were unknowingly exposed to male pheromones, wiped from the armpits of four volunteers, they gave significantly higher scores to the men. The pheromones appeared to enhance the men's sexual attractiveness. 'We do think the VNO is functional and it is certainly picking up signals,' says Dr Neave. But he is wary about research claiming pheromone-based potions can attract the opposite sex. 'It is a big leap to say if you put this on you will pull more girls,' he says. 'The evidence is not yet there.' And, while he remains optimistic about the long-term medical potential of pheromones, he adds the proviso that, 'We really are in very early days with this.' John Studd, professor of gynaecology at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, and one of the UK's foremost experts on PMS, is likewise encouraged by the early pheromone research. It's thought that one in three women suffers PMS symptoms and that for one in 20 the symptoms seriously blight their lives. Yet there is currently little doctors can do for them. Changing diet or taking nutritional supplements benefit some women. New-style antidepressants, such as Prozac and Seroxat, can help too, but may have side-effects and lead to long-term dependency. 'Any alternative would be very welcome,' admits Studd. Janet Treasure, professor of psychiatry at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's medical school in London, also runs a clinic for sufferers of anorexia nervosa and is keen to explore any possibility of hope for her patients, including pheromones. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Lynne Drummond treats people with severe social phobias at St George's Hospital in London. She helps people face their fears, is sceptical of what she terms 'miracle cures' and is not convinced that snorting pheromones is preferable to tackling the root causes of anxiety. For now the science of pheromones prompts many more questions than it answers. Until the mist clears, the potential for pheromone-based medicines looks set to remain obscured in a dense fug."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2002/nov/02/heritage.museums","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-02T14:44:26Z","webTitle":"Distant voices, still lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/02/heritage.museums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/02/heritage.museums","fields":{"headline":"Distant voices, still lives","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the US watched the millennium approach, time zone by time zone, the anchorman for the ABC network, Peter Jennings, watched the fireworks cascading over the Thames and offered his appraisal of recent British history. \"This country has been through so much,\" he said. \"In 1900, when Queen Victoria was on the throne, Britain ruled over one fifth of the world's population. But for all this fantastic show, Britain's possessions have dwindled to... Well, Hong Kong has gone now and, well... The Falklands are still British.\" There is only one thing more staggering than the pace and scale of the demise of the British Empire, and that is the pace and scale with which the British have sought either to elevate it to the level of myth or denigrate it with historical amnesia. For most of the past 30 years, since the bulk of former colonial territories gained independence, that has been the framework in which most discussion about this vital period in British history has struggled to take part. Caught between those who wished to romanticise the past and those who sought to forget it, there has been limited space to chart a path from our imperial past to our multicultural present. It is through that narrow space that the trustees of the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, recently opened in Bristol, have had to duck and dive as they have sought financial backing and political support for the enterprise. Ten years on they have provided a valuable and accessible narrative, imaginatively and carefully told, that helps those who are interested to reconnect with a vital part of their history. \"It has been a very fine line we have had to tread,\" says John Letts, the museum's founder. \"Everywhere we have tried to tell both sides of the story.\" The difficulties they encountered getting the project off the ground, not to mention completing it, tell us much about why we need such a museum and why we needed it done well. It set out aiming for £20m, with a sizable portion from public funds, such as the lottery; it ended up with £8m, almost all of it coming from private donors. The plans went through many incarnations. An early proposal to build the museum on the site of the former Crystal Palace, used for the Great Exhibition of 1851, was abandoned. Instead its home is in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Great Western Railway Station at Temple Meads in Bristol: a monument to the industrial age in a city linked to the Empire through the slave trade and migration. \"Part of the problem was simply reticence about tackling such a controversial topic,\" says Katherine Prior, the museum's historical adviser. \"There is a squeamishness in Britain about Empire and race.\" That squeamishness illustrates an amnesiac quality to the way Britain engages with the murkier parts of its own history. The southern states of the US are peppered with museums to the civil rights era and plaques to civil rights battles. They did not come about without a fight, but they arrived far faster and with far more resources than any commemoration of the Empire, whose demise broadly coincided with the end of segregation. Americans have sufficient confidence in their history to award the Vietnam veterans who stopped the My Lai massacre, when the men of Charlie Company murdered 300 innocent civilians. Admittedly, it was 30 years after the event. But it is difficult to imagine that in nine years we will even remember that the sinking of the Belgrano happened, let alone honour anyone who tried to stop it. None of that makes American history more morally acceptable. But it does make official versions of British history less believable. The result is a justifiable concern about the motivation of those who wish to evoke difficult parts of our past. Over the past decade, the museum has tried out several names. A reference to the Commonwealth was added and the word \"British\" disappeared temporarily, only to be replaced. The author Jan Morris, a patron of the museum, complained: \"The word 'empire' itself, we are assured, puts potential benefactors off. Theme parks about dinosaurs or King Arthur, certainly; reconstructions of Viking York or the Age of the Celts, yes; but a great museum about the British Empire - the most thundering contribution these islands ever made to history - well, on the whole, perhaps not.\" Well, that depends what you are going to do with that history. Suspicions could hardly have been tempered with the news that the chief backer of the project was Jack Hayward, the industrialist and chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, nicknamed \"Union Jack\" for his patriotism. Other donors include the Prince of Wales Foundation, the Rhodes Trust and the Beaverbrook Foundation. One of the trustees was Kenneth Baker, the former Tory education secretary. \"The naive and rather offensive assumption appears to have been that such men would only support a jingoistic and nostalgic survey of empire,\" says Prior. On the contrary, it seems naive not to have reservations about such a sensitive project being bankrolled by those who have no record of showing any sensitivity for the subject. But this isn't a reason to reject it summarily, as many government-funded bodies did. The trustees, says Prior, could not win. \"They were being judged on a museum that existed only in their critics' imaginations, and that judgment was blocking the support that would enable them to prove otherwise.\" Now that it does exist, it is clear that just because suspicions are well-founded it does not mean they will necessarily be fulfilled. Through 24 themed rooms the museum tells the story of the Empire with caution but not embarrassment. What the British have called the Indian Mutiny, and Indians have referred to as the first war of independence, the museum calls the \"great rebellion of 1857\". It tells us how words such as \"bungalow\" and \"shampoo\" came to these shores while some 300,000 white servants and prisoners left them to work on tobacco plantations before sugar and slavery took over. Pictures of childhood friendships and tales of how hypocrisy and racism frustrated interracial relationships combine personal drama with political and economic upheaval. Leaving the best until last, a series of personal testimonies from a variety of British voices from different races tell their stories. There are tales of economic migration, joy, discrimination, disappointment and integration. The result is a lasting imprint of the economic motor that drove Empire and colonisation and the human impact such a mammoth journey has had on all of us. · The British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, Bristol, is open daily, 10am-5pm.

Tonight children across the United States, and a good number in Britain, will dress up as witches, cats and Harry Potter characters to harass adults for snack-sized sweetmeats. And good luck to them. 2. The not-so-ancient Halloween tradition of stuffing yourself so full of sweets that you throw up on your little brother is not popular with everyone. Every child knows to avoid the misguided do-gooders who try to slip an apple or some other low-fat \"sweet\" into their plastic goodie bag. 3. Halloween is the second largest retail holiday of the year in the US, with shops selling costumes, plastic pumpkins, and decorations all year round. Halloween cards are big sellers too. 4. One company has even created a pumpkin-carving pattern in the likeness of George Bush. At the Ben and Jerry's Halloween site you can visit the \"flavour graveyard\" (scoop of Dastardly Mash, anyone?) and carve a virtual pumpkin. 5. Anyone too old to score chocolate off strangers can still flock to haunted houses, such as Cincinnati's haunted schoolhouse or the Skull Kingdom in Florida. If you prefer your ghosts with retro kitsch, try the Dungeon of Doom, a \"haunted\" 1970s United Artists cinema in Fresno, California. 6. The tangled origins of our modern chocolate and blood fest began with the ancient Druid new year's celebration, subsequently overlaid with the Catholic All Saints' Day on November 1. Before the Catholics came along, the druids would build a fire on October 31 to strengthen the sun god. At midnight, however, they would begin worshipping Samhain, the god of cold and darkness, who would be ruling throughout the winter. This was before the invention of winter sun breaks in Malaga. 7. Trick or treat probably began with a British All Souls' Day ritual, when the poor would go from door to door, receiving soul cakes in exchange for saying prayers for the givers. 8. If the November celebration of Thanksgiving spells doom for millions of turkeys in the US, then Halloween is the end of the line for many an unfortunate pumpkin. Possibly originating with an Irish custom of carving out turnips as \"Jack's lanterns\" in remembrance of a folk tale, the best use of a lovely autumn squash. 9. In Mexico, tonight marks the start of the Day of the Dead, a two-day holiday that began with a pre-Hispanic belief that death marked a continuation of life and is celebrated on post-Hispanic Catholic holy days. The holiday takes several forms across Mexico, but many families congregate at the graveyard to visit dead relatives, make offerings to their souls, and picnic with special foods and sweets. 10. Britain may not make such a fuss over the holiday, but in London there are ghost walks, and around the country there are Halloween events. Alternatively, you can just curl up in a dark room with a bottle of tequila, a large box of chocolate, and some Halloween music to scare off those begging children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2002/oct/31/travelnews.travel1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-31T09:29:51Z","webTitle":"Six cities shortlisted for culture capital bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/31/travelnews.travel1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2002/oct/31/travelnews.travel1","fields":{"headline":"Six cities shortlisted for culture capital bid","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Six cities with often wildly different definitions of culture were selected yesterday to go forward to the next stage of the contest to be European capital of culture in 2008. The shortlist, compiled by a panel of judges led by Sir Jeremy Isaacs and announced by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, includes Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool, Newcastle-Gateshead and Oxford. Most hope to reap the benefits, and the image change, won by Glasgow when it was city of culture in 1990. Six cities failed to make the list, including Belfast, once seen as a possible favourite for the title. Promoters there said they were \"gobsmacked\" not to have been included. The city's chances may have been wrecked by the region's volatile politics. Inverness, the only Scottish contender, also failed to make the final six, as did Bradford, Brighton and Hove, Canterbury and East Kent, and Norwich. The inclusion of Oxford was unexpected and may have been included as a safe option. But Newcastle-Gateshead, whose grand capital projects including the Baltic art gallery, Sage concert hall, and the millennium bridge have attracted international attention, remains the bookies' favourite. The final choice, to be announced next spring, will be made by Tony Blair, who might feel that a Tyneside winner would be too close for political comfort to his Sedgefield constituency. \"We have been knocked out by the determination, imagination, and sheer hard work that all the bidding cities have shown,\" said Sir Jeremy, whose team of 12 included broadcaster Sue MacGregor, pianist Barry Douglas and athlete Tessa Sanderson. Ms Jowell said all 12 cities had recognised culture as a \"rich seam for boosting civic pride and firing imaginations\". Her announcement was made at breakfast gatherings in each competing city. In Liverpool, Sir Bob Scott, the bid company's chief executive, clasped his hands almost in prayer - and then announced the good news, prompting a round of applause. David Henshaw, chief executive of Liverpool city council, said: \"It is not so many years ago that the very thought of Liverpool being a serious contender for European capital of culture would have been laughed at. It shows we have come a long way in a very short time.\" Birmingham also confessed to nerves. \"We were greatly relieved to see our name on the list,\" said Stephen Hetherington, director of the city's bid. \"But the nation's cultural make-up is changing and Birmingham is in the vanguard of that.\" Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, chairman of Newcastle-Gateshead Initiative, said Tyneside would continue to stress the potential impact of the bid on the city's social and economic regeneration challenges. Joe Simpson, Oxford's bid coordinator, said: \"If you read out the list of cities in Paris, most people would automatically select Oxford.\" Bristol's inclusion on the list had not been widely predicted. \"What is a surprise to some is a best kept secret to others,\" said Andrew Kelly, director of the city's bid. Lynne Williams, chief executive of Cardiff 2008, said: \"We are thrilled to be among the winners so far.\" But Belfast was crestfallen. \"The judges haven't taken any risks, have they?\" said a spokesman, adding: \"We are gobsmacked.\" Birmingham Birmingham has loftily distanced itself from its rivals by pointing out that it is twice as big as the biggest of them, already has significant European links and has been in the cultural investment business for years. It has ploughed more than £3bn into arts and culture during the last quarter of a century, with the annual total now reaching £80m. It estimates a successful bid will create 10,000 jobs and attract £100m in investment. The biggest visible sign of past investment is the Symphony Hall, the world-beating concert venue built for Sir Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. There are plans for a new Richard Rogers library and the Needle, an £18m landmark to rival the Eiffel Tower. But the Birmingham bid is less about bricks and mortar and rather more about learning and its claim to be the most culturally diverse city in Britain - a fifth of its citizens are from ethnic minorities. Bristol Bristol marries new technology and creativity with its industrial heritage in its bid to become capital of culture. Claiming to be one of the coolest cities for young people, its rich architectural heritage is reflected in the influence of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, engineer of the Great Western Railway and designer of the Clifton suspension bridge. The city has a wealth of regency and Georgian architecture and the Architecture Centre on the Harbourside. Nearby, the Watershed Media Centre reflects the city's reputation as a media capital. Bristol is home to a number of animation companies, including Oscar-winning Aardman Animations. The Arnolfini contemporary arts centre is expanding, thanks to a £7.5m grant from the Arts Council. The Bristol Old Vic is Britain's oldest working theatre. If Bristol wins, the bid team estimates there will be £340m investment, but it is unwilling to speculate on the number of jobs that would be created. Cardiff Cardiff has sold itself as a city for the new millennium, citing its strong links to sport and music and the regeneration of its waterfront. The bid embraces culture from film to new media, as well as opera and ballet. The Welsh capital boasts the Millennium Stadium, a state-of-the-art building with a retractable roof which can seat 72,500 people. As well as being a key sport venue it doubles as a performance space for classical and pop concerts and opera. Next spring the Wales Millennium Centre will open in Cardiff Bay, an international arts centre for musicals, opera, dance, ballet and festivals. The celebrated Welsh National Opera, based in the city, has won a clutch of awards, and the city has St David's Hall, a premier concert hall. A £40,000 visual arts prize has just been launched in Cardiff - the Artes Mundi prize, which will be awarded for the first time in 2004. Liverpool Liverpool offers a broad spectrum of culture, from its distinctive waterfront with the three elegant (soon to be four) graces, to its fine museums and art galleries and the Liverpool Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which performs in an art deco building restored to its former glory. There are many galleries and museums - Tate Liverpool on the Albert Dock houses the largest collection of modern art outside London. The Walker art gallery has reopened after extensive refurbishment. Liverpool boasts some fine architecture, including St George's Hall, the distinctive Liver Building on the waterfront, and the Albert Dock. During the recent Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Visual Art, which showcased work of British artists, a statue of Queen Victoria was transformed into a hotel room and the writer Will Self took up residence in a towerblock. Newcastle - Gateshead The marriage of Newcastle and Gateshead has been blessed by Antony Gormley's Angel of the North. Gateshead has led the way with three grand projects which have captured national and international attention. The Gateshead Millennium Bridge cost £22m, curves gracefully across the water and tilts to let vessels pass. It leads directly to the entrance of the Baltic, the £46m centre for contemporary art created from a former flour mill. Next door the Sage, a new 1,650- seat concert hall and music school, is under construction. Beyond high culture, Newcastle-Gateshead also shouts about sport, shopping, a vibrant night life, and the unique Centre for the Children's Book. Newcastle's Grey Street was voted the best streetscape in the country in a Today programme poll and the new bridge won the Stirling prize. Newsweek magazine feted Newcastle-Gateshead as one of the world's eight most creative new regions. Oxford In its entry, Oxford made much of its vast number of new technology companies, internet connections and reputation as the science hub of Britain. But its bid is the most traditionally \"cultural\" of all 12 submitted. It traded on the city's worldwide reputation for heritage and learning, using language of enlightenment and sometimes romance. \"It's a magical multicultural citadel of energy, activity and enterprise,\" says the bid document. \"If culture is the force by which mankind seeks to civilise itself, Oxford is its embodiment.\" New arts complexes will be created in Didcot and Abingdon and \"a significant cultural hub\" created in Banbury. The bid is endorsed by three prominent writers. Philip Pullman insists culture is not elitist, PD James hymns the beauty of a city that \"buzzes with intellectual argument and laughter\", and Ian McEwan says Oxford \"often feels like a city out of a poem by Yeats\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2002/oct/31/art.artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-31T02:20:39Z","webTitle":"Shirin Neshat talks about her new work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/oct/31/art.artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2002/oct/31/art.artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"The exotic and the everyday","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Art galleries are normally places of private contemplation and reaction. When three of Shirin Neshat's short films were shown at the Serpentine Gallery two years ago, however, the response was very different. People lingered in front of the screens, transfixed by not just the austere beauty of the images but the intensity and directness of the emotional charge they conveyed and, for western viewers, the sudden insights they provided into the complexities of Islam's relationship with itself and with the modern world. \"That was one of the most satisfying experiences I've had,\" says the Iranian artist as she prepares to leave her New York home for the performances of a new work, Logic of the Birds, which opens a six-night run at London's Union Chapel next week. \"I've never had such a diverse public. I was there for a couple of weekends and you had Arabs coming in, artists coming in, people out walking in Hyde Park who came in - and their attention span was amazing. It made me feel that for my work, London is the best place.\" Although they required actors, singers and crew, the three films - Turbulent, Rapture and Fervour - seemed very clearly the work of a single controlling intelligence. But in Logic of the Birds, already seen this year in New York and Minneapolis, Neshat is joined at the top of the credits by three of her regular collaborators, all fellow Iranian exiles in New York: the singer Sussan Deyhim, the film-maker and cinematographer Ghasem Ebrahimian, and the writer and film-maker Shoja Azari, who is also Neshat's partner. \"This is four people's vision combined into one,\" Neshat says, \"and an experiment for all of us.\" Neshat left Iran in 1974, aged 17, to study art at the University of California in Berkeley. Most of her contemporaries were sent to Europe and were expected to get married before they could complete their studies. \"My father was a doctor, but he was what I would call an intellectual - very well-read and very interested in knowledge. He insisted that I get as much education as my brothers.\" The revolution meant that she was unable to return to Iran until 1990, and it was only then that her career as an artist began. \"Until then,\" she says, \"I felt I had nothing to contribute.\" Between 1993 and 1997 she produced a widely noticed series of black and white photographs called Women of Allah, in which she superimposed Farsi calligraphy on the hands and faces of her subjects, some of whom were carrying guns. Soon she transferred her concerns and her aesthetic sensibility to film, and her reputation was made in 1999 when Turbulent won the international prize at the Venice Biennale. British audiences first saw it installed in a church in the City of London before it became part of the Serpentine show. Her latest film, titled Tooba, received its premiere at the Documenta festival in Germany this summer before becoming the first of her pieces to be shown in her native country, at an exhibition in Tehran's Museum of Contemporary Art. Like Tooba, Logic of the Birds finds Neshat moving away from her familiar black and white into colour. Based on The Conference of the Birds, a fable by the 12th-century Sufi poet and philosopher Farid al'Din Attar, the hour-long piece incorporates film, music and live staging. \"We were interested in experimenting with the idea of bringing film-making and live performance closer together, to the point where the narrative is conveyed through the film but is also unfolded on the stage.\" In Attar's poem a female bird leads her sceptical fellows off in search of a mythical ruler of their kingdom. \"It's about reflection and self-discovery, and it's about looking within yourself to find leadership; it also has a feminist twist because the main bird is female. We wanted to make a piece that touched on some of the philosophical aspects of the story without attempting to make a literal translation of an epic text. Here, we're interested in the mystical aspect of the story, touching on the notion of this crowd looking for a saviour. They're travelling to look for a leader, but essentially they should be looking inside, not outside.\" The political and social condition of Iran is again the focus. \"You could relate this story to a country anywhere in the world, but in our country we're always waiting for a leader to come and save us, and there's a perpetual sense of betrayal. Ultimately, then, that's not where you should be looking. The story is about individuality, identity, uniqueness. The dynamic of the mass versus the individual is at the heart of the poem. In parts of the Islamic world today the notion of individuality has become very problematic.\" There are no birds in this version of the story, but the main character, leading a flock on a mysterious journey, is played on the screen and on the stage by Deyhim, whose extra- ordinary improvised ululations dominated Turbulent. Deyhim and Neshat began their collaboration only four years ago, but they had met many years earlier in California. \"She was a dancer then, and I was just mesmerised by her. I was pretty conventional in those days, a typical Californian-Iranian girl, but she was so radical in her work that I was like, wow. Many years later I was living in New York and I saw a poster advertising her concert. I went along and I was blown away by how she had transformed herself from a dancer into an improvisational singer. \"Once we found each other again, we somehow clicked. We've both spent many years outside Iran, we both had a pretty wild lifestyle, an independent life away from our families, and we had to go through all sorts of channels to survive. And yet we're so interested in where we come from, and proud of it, and we're looking for a language that's a hybrid of the traditional and the modern. \"When I met her again she had just moved to New York from London with Richard Horowitz, her collaborator. I was thinking about making Turbulent, and I got introduced to Shoja and Ghasem around the same time. The whole group came together in that project and since then we've been more or less inseparable. It wasn't just a question of bringing our different experiences to what we could create as a work of art, but also of the need that we had as Iranians to create a sense of community, a home. We wanted to be around each other and the art was an excuse to continue the relationship.\" Despite her involvement in the fate of her own people, two years ago Neshat was still able to say, in an interview with Time magazine: \"I'm an artist, so I'm not an activist. I don't have an agenda.\" But while she and her partners were preparing Logic of the Birds, September 11 happened a few hundred yards down the street from her SoHo loft. Since then the west's attitude to Islam has become rather more difficult, and her view of her own role has changed. \"I'm beginning to feel that activism isn't such a bad thing,\" she says now. \"I'm really interested in social justice, and if an artist has a certain power of being heard and voicing something important, it's right to do it. It could still be done in such a way that it's not aggressive or overly didactic. I'm trying to find that form.\" She regretted that the attacks had not raised America's consciousness. \"Instead we're faced with an increasing sense of ignorant, simplistic patriotism that reiterates a deep sense of arrogance. What has happened in Palestine in recent months, with the Americans giving carte blanche to Israel to destroy a nation, is unforgivable. If Palestine had oil, of course, they would have been worth defending, but they have nothing and therefore Americans feel no need of humanitarian justice. 'In Iraq we're faced once again with the hypocrisy of a government that misleads its people and the world in saying one thing but meaning another. Most of us know that the removal of Saddam Hussein is essentially not the aim, which is gaining access to the oil and Republicans winning an election. Of course I don't support corrupt Islamic governments but I care about the Muslims and how the economic and political pressures have created a volatile situation both inside and outside their countries. Ultimately, fundamentalism and terrorism breed in such an environment.\" It would be bound to affect her work, she says, even if the treatment remained at a symbolic level. \"It could be something very metaphoric, very abstract. I've been careful in all my exploration of this subject not to point fingers, but I feel it's almost come to the point where that lack of a position is itself taking a position. So I'll make work that may touch on the absurdity and hypocrisy at both ends and reveal how vulnerable yet powerful an individual may be in taking charge of their own destiny and refusing to be controlled spiritually, morally and politically.\" The westerner looking at her pieces will almost certainly not see what an Iranian sees. \"Sometimes it's almost as if they're totally opposite,\" she says. But no one could miss the real point. However abstracted and metaphoric the approach may be, however ravishingly exotic the sights and sounds, the struggle of individuals claiming the right to control their own destiny and identity is what compels the gaze.

And it says a problem with the Apache's main weapon, the Hellfire missile which can damage the aircraft's tail rotor when it is fired, has still not been solved though it was identified by the US two years ago. Moreover, it adds, it is doubtful whether there will be enough trained pilots to enable Apaches to provide a key role in Britain's main taskforce, the 16 Assault Brigade, by the planned date of 2005. The report, by the national audit office, says new helicopters are having to be stored, at a cost of £6m, until there are sufficient pilots to fly them. The Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, is spending nearly £14m fitting extra missiles on ageing Lynx helicopters to try to fill the gap. The delay in pilot training is the result of problems with flight simulators, part of a £1bn private finance initiative deal negotiated with Boeing, the US aircraft firm, and Westland, the British manufacturer of the Apache. The MoD has spent £37m \"for training courses which have not run\", says the audit office. The full Apache pilot training programme will not be completed until 2007. The report says Apache pilots will not be able to communicate securely with pilots of other helicopters, including the Lynx, Gazelle, Sea King and Puma. \"Nor will [the Apache] be able to exchange data securely with most of the United Kingdom's military aircraft or the other battlefield helicopters or with United Kingdom ground forces,\" it adds. It also points out that the MoD has yet to decide on the full range of missions on which the Apache will be used. The MoD has said it would cost an extra £30m to base the helicopter on ships. The report criticises the US for delaying the release of technical data about the Apache to Westland. The Conservative government in 1996 signed a contract for 64 Apaches at a current estimated total cost, including pilot training, of £4.1bn. · Building an Air Manoeuvre Capability: The Introduction of the Apache Helicopter, national audit office"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2002/oct/30/minutebyminute.sport1","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-30T22:46:05Z","webTitle":"Borussia Dortmund 2Arsenal 1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/30/minutebyminute.sport1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2002/oct/30/minutebyminute.sport1","fields":{"headline":"Borussia Dortmund 2Arsenal 1","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1 min: Greetings. The big news of the night: David Seaman has had a haircut. It's not a sensible short back and sides, but he's definitely had a good six inches off the end of his ponytail. Mighty oaks and small acorns etc. Oh yeah, and Robert Pires starts for the Gunners. Dortmund kick off and the ball goes to Christoph Metzelder, who is wearing a mask to protect a broken nose. He looks ridiculous. 2 mins: Lars Ricken bursts through a wide gap between Cygan and Campbell and smashes the ball of the foot of the left-hand post. He should have scored. 3 mins: After a big build-up, Pires and Henry conspire to get a probing ball into the Dortmund box. Lehmann gathers comfortably. 7 mins: Not much happening here at the moment. I think both teams have paused to draw breath after Ricken's horrific early miss. Arsenal get forward down the right flank and win a corner when Henry is forced out over the byline by Christian Woerns. 8 mins: Now that wasn't too clever, was it Thierry? Curling a corner straight out for a Borussia Dortmund goal-kick rarely is. 9 mins: Christoph Metzelder is forced into a good clearance when Ljungberg gets a good cross in. 11 mins: Another close shave for Arsenal. Rosicky shoots from distance, Seaman gets down early and the ball appears to bobble dangerously before being clutched safely to the big keeper's bosom like a new-born baby. Aah. 13 mins: Frings hits a great cross-field ball to Dede. He fires one in to Jan Koller who bashes an easy chance of the right-hand post. Miraculously, the ball stays out. That was an even easier chance than Ricken's. 15 mins: Arsenal's defence is a shambles so far. I don't really have the words to describe how bad Koller's miss was. A low header into an empty net from point-blank range and he managed to hit the post. Astonishing. 17 mins: GOAL: Borussia Dortmund 0 - 1 Arsenal The Gunners won a free outside the Dortmund box. Thierry Henry blasted it over the six-man wall and got ferocious dip on the ball to send it screaming past the utterly helpless Jens Lehmann. 22 mins: Cygan fouls Koller and Dortmund win a free outside the box but are unable to emulate Henry's effort. 23 mins: Dortmund win another free to the right of the Arsenal box. Rosicky swings it in and Christian Woerns gets his forehead to it under pressure. Wide. 25 mins: Lars Ricken swivels and shoots a scuffed effort low and narrowly wide past David Seaman's right-hand post. It wouldn't have gone in anyway as the big fella had it covered. One would hope. 26 mins: Patrick Vieira takes his turn to miss a sitter. Ljungberg cruised past Woerns, spotted his team-mate outside him, stroked the ball into his path and then watched in despair as the Frenchman somehow contrived to shoot across the face of the goal and wide. 29 mins: Rosicky wins a free with a blatant dive. Seconds later, Cygan brings down Koller again to concede a free just outside the Arsenal box, on the edge of the D. Dede dinks it harmlessly over the bar. 31 mins: This has been a great match so far. Three near-misses, one goal, a man with a short ponytail (Seaman) and a man who looks like a crow (Metzelder). It's real - cliche ahoy! - end to end stuff. But hard work for those of us who type things for living. 35 mins: Metzelder, who with his mask resembles Gonzo from The Muppet Show, very nearly makes a dog's breakfast of a backpass but gets away with it. Dortmund break and Ewerthon attempts to emulate his compatriot Ronaldinho (and everyone else in world football) by lobbing Seaman with a delicate chip hoisted up with the outside of his right foot. It's a great effort, but it's over the bar. 38 mins: GOAL Borussia Dortmund 1 - 1 Arsenal Stop me if you've heard this one before. A terrible mistake by Seaman. He totally misjudged the bounce of a long-range Rosicky free-kick from outside the box. Koller went to head it in, didn't get a touch and although it got a slight deflection off - I think - Giberto Silva, Seaman should really have had it covered. Sadly for him and for Arsenal, he didn't. It was exactly like Zola's freak-free for Chelsea against Arsenal a few weeks ago. Terrible defneding all round, resulting in david Seaman standing with his hands on his hips and looking very forlorn. 43 mins: Wiltord shoots just wide after having an opening presented by Vieira who had done well to chase a lost cause out by the corner flag. 44 mins: I can't remember any other game that's had me this busy before. It's being played at a thundering clip and there's been goals and near-misses aplenty. Both teams have looked good going forward, but decidedly ropey and fragile at the back. Wiltord brings the half to a spectacular close by stinging Lehmann's palms with a shot the Dortmund 'keeper does well to hold on to at the near post. Half-time 45 mins: Arsenal get the second half underway. Lots of mails flooding in, which unfortunately I've had very little time to look at. I had to dash out for a half-time smoke because I was so traumatised by the hectic pace of the first-half. Several thousand people want to know where Dennis Bergkamp came from, as I alluded to him earlier and he isn't playing. My apologies - it was Freddie Ljungberg ... you pedantic, nit-picking whiners. As for the assorted other questions from the inquisitive to the downright nosey (you know who you are): I'm not wearing anything, and I was in Dublin and Birr, Co. Offaly in Ireland for the weekend. As for the two sisters in 48 hours which everyone keeps talking about - I'm saying nothing. You might need to take that one up with my colleague Sean Ingle, who is doing the commentary on the Liverpool v Valencia game and will find it very hard to type with the broken fingers he's going to have if I find out he's been telling porkies about my social life in his match report. 48 mins: Vieira concedes a free just outside the Dortmund box for hauling Rosicky to the ground. 49 mins: \"I'm fairly desperate to get a mention today as I've a bet with one of the lads for a tenner. There's a curve off a pretzel in it for you,\" says Niall Crowley in New York. Sorry Niall, no gratuitous \"mentions\" tonight. I'm too busy. 50 mins: PSV are beating Auxerre 2-0 in the other match in this group. If it stays like that, Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund will both go through to the next phase. 52 mins: Dede crosses in from the left and despite being a giant lunk who's no good for anything else, Koller gets beaten in the air by Campbell. How did he manage to nail down a career as a footballer? He should be in a funfair getting prodded by inquisitive children with sticks. 53 mins: Freddie Ljungberg peels away from Metzelder, receives a pass from Henry and attempts to chip Lehmann. Close, but no cigar. 54 mins: Simon in Germany reckons the Dortmund goal wasn't Seaman's fault, because if Silva hadn't headed it in, Koller would have anyway. I take your point Simon, even though Koller couldn't head snow off a rope. 58 mins: A ball is hoofed out over the side line, and Mattias Sammer, the Dortmund coach, clips a deft back-heel volley over his head from the edge of the dugout. He gets a huge cheer from the home fans. It was the best piece of skill so far tonight. 60 mins: A penalty for Dortmund. Seaman brings down Koller in the box. 62 mins: Borussia Dortmund 2 - 1 Arsenal Tomas Rosicky strokes the penalty low, hard and to David Seaman's right. Good penalty. Amazingly, it was won by Jan Koller, who made up a couple of yards to outrun Pascal Cygan. Seaman came out of his goal, and Koller poked the ball past him, inviting the inevitable trip. It's typical. I call him a giant lunk and he beats somebody in a sprint for the first time in his career. 67 mins: Toures comes on for Arsenal to replace Pires, who's had a very quiet night. 68 mins:The attack from which Dortmund scored came about after Henry dilly-dallied over a cross at the far end of the field and was dispossessed by Woerns. Straight from the post-goal kick-off, Henry missed a good opportunity to equalise when he failed to get enough power on a half-chance. I wish everyone would calm down so I can try and catch up with what's going on and correct some of the thousands of embarrassing typos I'm certain are littering this report. A lull, a lull, my kingdom for a lull. Reuter replaces Kehl for Dortmund, and I haven't even had the opportunity to type: \"In the cut-throat world of the Champions League, it's Kehl or be Kehled\" yet. Bugger! 72 mins: Gilberto and Reuter go for a 50-50 ball just outside the box. Reuter is brought to ground and although there was no discernible foul, Dortmund win the free. Torsten Frings blasts the ball straight into the wall. In case he gets substituted too, I'll get this out of the way now ... Frings can only get better. 75 mins: Ashley Cole goes down and gets an accidental boot in the face from Lars Ricken. A quick squirt from the magic bottle sees him right as rain again. he's a hardy fella. 76 mins: Reuter gets booked for a clumsy challenge on Ljungberg. Naughty boy, no supper for you. 77 mins: Seaman scurries out of his goal and whips the ball out of the path of the onrushing Ewerthon. Kanu replaces Wiltord for the Gunners. 79 mins: Arsenal win a corner, and I type \"whips the ball out of the bath of the onrushing Emerton\". Kanu heads wide and I rectify my heinous but mildly amusing error. Edu replaces Gilberto Silva on the Arsenal team. 81 mins: Frings get(s) better. 82 mins: The flurry of late substitutions continues as Heinreich replaces Ricken for the Germans. Expect lame gags about \"Heinreich manoeuvres\" any second now. On the subject of bad puns, it occurs to me that if Dortmund's lumbering centre-forward was injured and had to have his groin massaged, I'd be able to type: \"Borussia Dortmund get their Koller felt.\" 85 mins: Freddie Ljungberg comes close, but the ball bobbles this much out of his reach and he can't make contact. Arsenal have four minutes to score or concede a goal, thereby ensuring they don't lose their fourth consecutive game 2-1. 87 mins: Ljungberg tees one up for Henry on the edge of the Dortmund box. He attempts to kung-fu kick it into the box but his effort goes horribly, horribly wrong and ends up resembling a feeble, poorly placed back pass. 89 mins: Another substitution: Rosicky is replaced by the Moroccan-born French defender Madouni. 90 mins: Heinrich wins a free after coming out second best from a tussle with Cygan. It's floated into the box and Arsenal clear. 90 +1 mins: Ewerthon piles forward and passes to Dede, who promptly wins a corner off Lauren. Frings takes, but nowt comes of it. 90 +3 mins: Arsenal win a corner, it's swung in and Lehmann catches brilliantly. The referee blows his whistle and it's full-time. Amazingly, Arsenal lose their fourth consecutive game 2-1. It doesn't really matter, however, as both they and Borussia Dortmund go through to the next phase anyway. That, I don't mind saying, was a cracking game of football. If I didn't have to do a minute-by-minute report on it, I might even have enjoyed it! Many thanks for all the e-mails, which I haven't had a chance to read yet. The few I have seen are derogatory, or pointing out my myriad typographical errors. So thanks for them. In my defence I'd like to point out that I'm a lover, not a typer. Anyway, I'd better go and correct them all now. G'night.

No real surprises in the team news with the lumbering-but-willing Emile Heskey back to partner Michael Owen for Liverpool, and useless galoot John Carew up front on his own for Valencia. OK, I'm off to place some bets, I'll be back in a second. 1 min: We're off! And already the emails are flooding in. \"Are you as funny as Barry Glendenning?\" asks Karaca Mestci from over the pond. Of course not Karaca - and neither have I pulled two sisters in 48 hours like my colleague either. \"I actually cannot believe that any sane person would be reading the commentary instead of watching the game live,\" she adds, \"but hey, some people prefer cyber sex to real sex so, I am sure some wackos out there would also rather read the game than watch!\" Well, if you want wackos, you've come to the right place, Mestci. Rolf Harris from Sweden's bound to be emailing in before too long. 4 min: It's been a decent start so far, Liverpool doing the pressing and Owen looking dangerous. \"Am following this at work in Washington DC, now happily sniper free,\" says Amit Gupta. \"Who do you think is the bigger stiff, Carew or Carsten Jancker?\" It's got to be Jancker, a man who moves with all of the subtlety of a tank crashing its way through the Bavarian countryside. 7 min: Liverpool win a corner. Valencia pull all 11 men back into the area but Diao is still given a free header about eight yards out. Sadly for the in-full-voice Kop, it drifts wide. \"Surely a bit Brit-o-centric the opening line of 'rather than enjoying England's great nightlife'? says TrUlster (who's writing from Norway and not the Reverend Ian Paisley's bedroom). \"In this oh-so-globalised internet world I bet you have plenty of non-English readers, who are unable to sample the potential delights of English nightlife.\" Delights such as the smashed bottle in the face, perhaps? 9 min: Hamman goes in on Aimar and suddenly it kicks off. Cue lots of pushing and shoving but, surprisingly, no yellow card for the Liverpool midfielder. \"I'm not out enjoying the nightlife as I'm being held in work against my will,\" says Ian Manders. \"Please help me escape! Oh, and come on the Reds!\" 11 min: Valencia nearly score! Aimar's cross takes a slight deflection and thwacks the top of the crossbar with Dudek swinging and missing. 15 min: Lots of huff and puff but not much cutting edge so far. Baraja's just hit the wall from a 30-yard free kick. Last season these two sides were so defensive-minded I'd have lumped on the under 2.5 goals option big-time, but tonight I'm staying well clear. My colleague Glendenning, however, has boldly predicted three or more goals for tonight's match. And he's usually right... 17 min: After a sloppy piece of play, Liverpool up the tempo and only a great sliding tackle from Carbone stops Owen being clean through. \"If Ian Manders wasn't being held at work against his will, he would be able to go out in lovely Derby,\" says his colleague Alex Davis. \"Work wins, I think...\" 20 min: Valencia win another free kick, 20 yards out. The Kop boos and spits fury, Baraja steps over the ball and Aimar curls it over. \"Watching the game live in Washington DC costs $10 to enter the bar, requires you to sneak out of work, and quite possibly means that you get drunk in the middle of the day,\" says Sandip Sukhtankar. And what's so wrong with that, Sandip? 22 min: Superb play from Diao who makes 30 yards before reversing it to Owen, about 25 yards out. He's lining up a curler, he's lining up a curler... which goes miles over. Arsenal are 1-0 up against Dortmund, by the way. 25 min: Computer problems. Sorry. You haven't missed much though - Aimar's just stamped on Diao but no one spotted it and that's about it. Grrr - where are the techies when you need them? Playing War Hammer and eating Monster Munch, that's where.... 29 min: Nice play from Carew, who holds off Traore and wins a corner. From it Aimar sets up Baraja who somehow shoots over from six yards. Incredible. What a miss! Incidentally, the Kop are booing and taunting Carew like nobodies business after he slagged Liverpool off yesterday. 33 min: Valencia are beginning to have the better of it now, while Liverpool are passing it around with all the confidence of the England team under Graham Taylor. \"I am sitting in San Diego, California, sipping a cocktail and basking in the sunshine,\" says Dominic Lyons, who's in no way smug about his situation. \"Less than two months ago I was watching the Reds in a pub on Merseyside, losing two goals in the last ten minutes to Newcastle. Are Liverpool better, worse, or the same since then? Incline, decline, or static? Er, I think they're about the same Dominic: they've rode their luck a little bit this season and, to be honest, their unbeaten run in the Premiership flatters them. 34 min: GOAL! - Liverpool 0 - 1 Valencia Carew sets up Rufete, who's shot from 15 yards cannons off Hyppia's heel and deflects wickedly past Dudek. It was coming to be honest... 37 min: Valencia are looking as confident as John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever at the moment. They're strutting their stuff in midfield while Liverpool are chasing shadows. My Dad - no really - has just emailed in to say: \"Just started to read your stuff on the net.Your Mother has thrown me off ITV2 so she can watch her precious Bill!\" Some things never change, do they Dad? 39 min: Best chance of the night for Liverpool: Heskey flicks it on for Owen, who slips it to Gerrard about ten yards out. He should score but he blasts it straight at Canizares. Dortmund have made it 1-1 against Arsenal - another Seaman ricket apparently... 42 min: A brilliant save from Dudek keeps Liverpool in the match. Baraja finds Carew, whose shot from a tight angle is fingertipped wide. 43 min: Possession stats: Liverpool 31% Valencia 59% 45 min: Who said Heskey was willing-but-lumbering? (OK, it was me) Because at the moment the man's a gazelle, cutting inside nicely before setting up Owen, who headers a half-chance well wide. \"While I am decidedly un-techie-like, sitting here in Indianapolis, Indiana, I could murder a packet of Monster Munch,\" says Simon Gaunt. \"Sadly, America has failed to embrace vinegar as a snack flavouring.\" One day perhaps, Simon, one day... Half-time: After one minute of added time, the referee blows up. Valencia are ahead and deservedly so. \"You are quite funny as it happens,\" says Samantha Lundigran from New Zealand. \"I'm in New Zealand sitting in my nightie and my die-hard red fan husband Anthony is sitting at work (not in a nightie) down the road and we're both following the match with you. Bloody Valencia. Bloody typical. Could you make my day (as Liverpool are unlikely to) and tell us a few jokes.\" Er, all mine are too rude, Samantha. But I'm willing to open this to the floor (god help us all). Anyone know any good jokes? 46 min: We're off again. Before I go on, thanks to everyone who pointed out that the possession stats I mentioned earlier added up to 90% rather than 100%. \"I'm wondering who had the other 10% of possession. The ref? The crowd?\" says Alex Till, echoing the views of hundreds of you. Sorry. 48 min: No subs at half-time, and - despite a rousing cheer from the Kop as they came out - no obvious change in Liverpool yet. Meanwhile the jokes are coming in think and fast. \"What's the difference between pink and purple?\" asks Karaca Mestci. \"YOUR GRIP! Come on that's bloody funny now.\" Oh dear, it's started... 49 min: What a miss from Michael Owen! A lovely pass from Gerrard sets up Heskey, who storms into the box before cutting back to Owen. He's eight yards out and must score. But no: he dillies and dallies and Canizares smothers. Great save - but Owen should have put it away. Incidentally, Andy in Hamilton, Bermuda says: \"Please let Simon Gaunt (he of the Monster Munch cravings) know that I've managed to find Marmite flavoured crisps over here in Bermuda.... so anything must be possible.\" More of your jokes are coming soon (when I can find a clean one). 52 min: Baraja's running the game at the moment - Valencia have settled down after a slow start to the second half. Thanks to Aaron Miller for this. \"A plane was about to crash and there were five people on board and only four parachutes. The first person said. \" I am Michael Owen, one of the best footballers in the world. I am worth a lot of money and my fans need me so I think I should be saved.\"The others agreed and gave him one of the parachutes and off he went. The second person said \"I am Gerry Adams, a radical Irish politician who can really help my country and I think I should be saved.\" The others said.\" OK\" and gave him a parachute. The third person said \"I am David Beckham, captain of the English national squad. I have a wife and two sons. Everyone knows I am a really nice guy and everyone thinks I am stupid, but I'm not, so I am taking a parachute.\" and off he went. There were two folk left, the Pope and a 10-year-old schoolgirl. The Pope said, \"child I am old and frail and have lived my life while you are young with everything before you. You take the parachute and I will stay with the aircraft and take my chances\" \"It's OK\", said the girl, \"there are still two parachutes. David Beckham picked up my schoolbag.\" 55 min: Liverpool nearly score again - Gerrard's inswinging corner is missed by Heskey before skidding off the turf towards the back post. In the end it takes a good save by Canizares to keep it out. Hamann nearly seizes on the rebound, but his header is blocked. Is the tide beginning to turn? 58 min: Liverpool are having more of the possession now but they're still offering very little width. \"What do you call a striker that doesn't score goals?\" asks Peter Bosiak. \"Heskey.\" Now you're just being mean, Peter... 60 min: Heskey, who after an anonymous first 40 minutes is playing well, has just gone narrowly wide with a 20-yard shot. Meanwhile Mick from Boston says that www.britdepot.com sells \"Monster Munch and a whole lot more British goods in the US and around the world. And no, I don't get a percentage of the profits.\" Hmmm, if you say so Mick. 61 min Liverpool subs: Baros on for Heskey, Smicer on for Murphy. 64 min: The Kop are still giving Liverpool bombastic support, but Valencia are still looking mighty comfortable. Still, like in the first game, the Spanish champions are taking every opportunity to delay the game. \"Why don't the Chicago Bears have a website?\" asks Simon Willsmer. \"Because they can't put three W's in a row.\" Having spent a year in Wisconsin, I appreciate that joke more than most Simon. 67 min: Valencia sub: Aimar off for Angulo. 70 min: A quiet period in the game. Liverpool still aren't really putting it together, their play is very bitty. Valencia, meanwhile, are sitting back, happy to hit with pace on the break. \"I have the office TV on, the Guardian webpage open and its a beautiful spring evening here in Buenos Aires,\" says a contented Dave Bruck. \"Here's my joke: why was the broom late? Because he overswept! Broom Broom etc.\" Oh dear, oh dear. Surely they can't get much worse than that? 74 min: Unlike the likes of Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on Sky, we don't have to say a game's great when it's not. Which is a good thing, because this game is firing on zero cylinders at the moment. \"Hey again,\" says Andrew Moore. \"Please convey my thanks to Mick from Boston for the britdepot.com link, your, er, viewers, lets call them, may be interested to know the top 10 things expats order...1. Walkers Crisps, 2. Heinz Baked Beans, 3. Heinz Spaghetti Hoops, 4. Cadburys Buttons, 5. Irn Bru, 6. McVities Mini Cheddars, 7. Tunnock's Tea Cakes, 8. Colmans Mint Sauce, 9. HP Brown Sauce, 10. Chocolate Expat Box.\" Crisps and chocolate are much better in the UK than US, discuss. 77 min: At last, a rare moment of quality amid the tedium: Angulo, who's about 25 yards out unleashes a howitzer and it takes an excellent save from Dudek to stop it flying into the roof of the net. Incidentally to answer your question Guy Parker, yes I did spend a year in Milwaukee. 79 min: Valencia sub: Nista on for Carew. The Giant Norwegian very nearly scored just before he was taken off, by the way - the ball pinballed around the Liverpool box for about 30 seconds before finally being cleared. 80 min: The first yellow card of the evening: Albelda for going through on Smicer. Meanwhile your jokes have - incredibly - got worse. \"A man walks into a newsagent and says \"Can I have a packet of helicopter flavoured crisps?\" says Harinder Braich. \"The shopkeeper replies \"Sorry, we only serve plane.\" 82 min: Liverpool sub: Cheyrou on for Carragher. 84 min: Albelda hacks down Cheyrou but doesn't pick up his second yellow card. If I was the referee I'd have sent him off - it was a terrible challenge. Meanwhile Marcus Foley says: \"Chocolate may be better in the UK compared to US but there is a reason why there are many many fat Bavarians. OK, the beer helps but the chocolate is great.\" And there was I (cue terrible national stereotype) thinking it had something to do with lying on sunbeds all day... 85 min: At last some Liverpool pressure: Hamann's deflected free-kick is easily saved by Canizares then Hyppia heads over the bar. 87 min: Valencia sub: Vicente on, Gonzalez off. Typical Valencia, they're taking ages to make it (Gonzalez even tries to shake the ref's hand). Let's hope the ref adds on another couple of minutes. 88 min: Yellow card for Nista for time-wasting. 89 min: So close from Milan Baros! His left-foot shot from 10 yards is scrambled clear by Canizares. Meanwhile Thomas Nolan says: \"Crisps in Pennsylvania are a disastrously bland affair - the authorities probably believe something like prawn cocktail flavour would inflame the locals and cause vast orgies and even - god forbid - somebody to curse on TV. Irish crisps are the best - Tayto cheese and onion - mmm, ask your mate Barry about them: my Kingdom for a Tayto Cheese &amp; Onion.\" 90 min: Three minutes of added time, can Liverpool snatch an equaliser? \"I'm flabbergasted that marmite wasn't on the top ten orders from britdepot.com,\" says a flabbergasted Sowjana from NYC. \"Americans cannot begin to fathom why we Brits would consider boiled yeast to be suitable for breakfast consumption. They have so much to learn. I proudly display a bottle next to my PC at work.\" 90+2 min: More time-wasting antics from Valencia, who seem to have taken gamesmanship to a new level. Trust me, the Italians have nothing on this lot. By the time the referee has sorted out all the pushing and shoving in the penalty box injury time is nearly over. No wonder the Kop are chanting: \"Cheats, cheats, cheats\". FULL TIME: It's over. Valencia have done the double over Liverpool, who now need to get something at Basle in two weeks time. The Reds had a few chances but they were poor: they hardly strung a pass together all night. To round up your emails: no I did not go to the \"prestigious Marquette University,\" Midifix; Tayto crisps are fantastic say all of our Irish readers, and Dan from Washington DC has made me all nostalgic about Wisconsin by taking about deep fried cheese curds and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Oh, those were the days! Thanks for all your emails and sorry I couldn't use them all, cheers Sean."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2002/oct/30/religion.uk14","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-30T13:00:20Z","webTitle":"Seventh-Day Adventist Church","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/30/religion.uk14","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/oct/30/religion.uk14","fields":{"headline":"Seventh-Day Adventist Church","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Background and beliefs: Established in the United States largely through the preaching of William Miller (1782-1849).

No sooner had the credits rolled on Jeremy Clarkson's profile of Isambard Kingdom Brunel but there you were, dialling to cast your vote for the great engineer in the poll of Great Britons (BBC2). Then, along came Andrew Marr trumpeting Charles Darwin. Propelled by Mr Marr's gesticulations - the frenzy of which suggested he was doing magic tricks with invisible props - you were diving for the red button on your remote and hoping evolution would run its course. And then Rosie Boycott appeared with her coolly persuasive case championing Diana, Princess of Wales. This only confused matters further. Every time, you found yourself emphatically agreeing with the last person to express an opinion. Now you know what it's like to be Tony Blair. Diana might not have invented, discovered or constructed anything but, Rosie maintained, she added to the sum of human happiness. Not just by working for charities and by breaking taboos surrounding HIV and Aids, but also by being unafraid to admit vulnerability, show emotion and hug her sons in public, the first royal to do so. \"Progress isn't all it's cracked up to be,\" Rosie said, apparently dismissing advancements in science, technology, medicine, engineering and the arts in favour of a cuddle. Love, it seems, is all we need. While Alan Davies, who is putting forward John Lennon's case, might be miffed that one of his finest lines has been appropriated, Rosie was on a roll and, such was her passion, she carried us on. The only slightly distracting aspect of the film was the extended metaphor to which Rosie returned repeatedly. Diana was a fairy tale princess, she explained, and her story enchanted the world. It was this enchantment, ergo, that made Diana a great Briton. If she was a fairy tale princess, Diana lived in a Grimm world rather than a Disney land. After their parents' divorce, Diana and brother Charles were like Hansel and Gretel lost in the woods. While she was as quiet and dowdy as her sisters were vivacious, Diana became Cinders and then, when she got her Prince, Charles had a secret that was never to be discussed and so assumed the mantle of Bluebeard. Camilla, we can only assume, was an old dragon. By the end of the hour, I half expected Prince Andrew to be referred to as the muffin man who lives on Drury Lane. This minor irk notwithstanding - for it came accompanied by some lovely fairy tale animation - Great Britons: Diana was a winning and thoughtful examination of the Princess of Wales's legacy. She may have been forgotten by many of her celebrity friends, who have now transferred their affections to Charles and Camilla, but there can be little doubt that she had a considerable effect on the British public imagination. Lists only ever tell you about those who compile them, so along with the bridge-builders and biologists, it's only fitting that there should be someone to represent the emotional life of Britain, even if that someone is a kohl-eyed member of the landed gentry. Whether Diana is the greatest Briton or merely a great one (and whether her presence on the list demonstrates our enduring need for stories or our capacity for hysterical self-delusion) depends entirely on your definition of greatness. There was very little love in the room when it came to Understanding John Birt (BBC4). In fact, there was vitriol running down the walls as the former BBC director general was not so much profiled as had his character assassinated and his legacy slashed and burned. It was hardly an unprovoked attack. If the designer suits, management consultants, abrasive manner and lack of social skills weren't justification enough, there was also - almost everyone in this little nugget packed with loathing agreed - his seemingly complete lack of creative vision. Hell hath no fury. In The Secret Life of Us (E4), meanwhile, aspiring novelist Evan was passing judgement on journalism. It isn't really writing, he maintained, but just stuff in the papers. \"It's churned out. You have to fill a space on a page. And there's this bullshit formula you have to follow. And you've got deadlines.\" Everyone's got an opinion, haven't they."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2002/oct/30/theatre.artsfeatures1","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-30T02:41:09Z","webTitle":"SeZaR, Stranmillis College Theatre, Belfast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/oct/30/theatre.artsfeatures1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2002/oct/30/theatre.artsfeatures1","fields":{"headline":"SeZaR","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"South Africanised stagings of classic stories are hot business on UK stages these days.

She becomes the Soothsayer. The opening scene stages SeZaR's triumphant return to the fictional kingdom of Azania from victory in north Africa. The action is glossed here and throughout by recorded, European-accented news broadcasts - a reminder of the role the Euro-American media plays in globalising local conflicts. Loud music blasts as SeZar (Hope Sprinter Sekgobela) dances with amazing intensity, surrounded by his followers. There is a sense of religious fervour coursing through this civil celebration, and the atmosphere is electric. The eight-strong black South African cast are wonderfully talented. But then the text kicks in - and the problems start. Though she has pared it back, Farber follows the narrative line closely; she has combined English with the South African language of Setswana; sometimes the actors switch languages mid-line. This is thrilling and works to defamiliarise what is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays. But Shakespeare holds this production down. The energy dissipates when the text is performed in the original; the English verse simply isn't as powerful, spoken by these actors, as the African language. Why did we need the pentameter at all? This question might be perceived as heresy in Johannesburg. An Observer article by Anthony Sampson excerpted in the programme argues that \"the Bard was bigger than the Bible and Marx in the struggle for freedom from apartheid\". Mandela read Julius Caesar for solace on Robben Island. But performing this production in Shakespeare's homeland shifts the context considerably; what might have felt like a liberating mix of classic and native here brings with it a troubling whiff of neo-colonialism. A non-British culture uses a \"classic\" British text to contextualise its own relevant and timely tale of greed, intrigue, and betrayal - and then exports it back to Britain, reassuring us, perhaps, that we westerners still have the answers, and the power. · At the Playhouse, Nottingham (0115-941 9419), until November 2.

Harris, who died from Hodgkin's disease on Friday after falling ill two months ago, has already picked up a best actor nomination at the British independent film awards (Bifa) for his role as a Learesque gangster in My Kingdom. The film, which had its world premiere at the recent Toronto film festival, is a modern British gangster story set in Liverpool and modelled on Shakespeare's tale of an ageing, tormented monarch. As in the Bard's play, a powerful dynasty headed by a charismatic, manipulative father falls when he decides to hand over his criminal empire to his three corrupt and power-hungry daughters. Directed by Don Boyd, perhaps best known for his Patsy Kensit vehicle Twenty-One more than a decade ago, the film also stars Lynn Redgrave, Paul McGann and Jimi Mistry. Harris was twice nominated for a best actor Oscar during his lifetime, for 1963's This Sporting Life and 1990's The Field. The Bifa ceremony takes place tonight, with Harris going up against Timothy Spall for All or Nothing, Bill Nighy for Lawless Heart and James Nesbitt for Bloody Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2002/oct/29/healthandwellbeing.health","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-29T16:24:43Z","webTitle":"Confessions of a Diet Coke addict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/oct/29/healthandwellbeing.health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2002/oct/29/healthandwellbeing.health","fields":{"headline":"Confessions of a Diet Coke addict","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For someone who has never been on a diet, I drink an enormous amount of Diet Coke. It is usually the first thing to pass my lips in the morning and, often, the last thing I taste at night. There's no sound more satisfying than the hiss and pop of a can being opened and, a few minutes after my first sip, I feel my heart flutter. I blame late nights spent studying for university exams when I needed regular swigs from a two-litre bottle to prevent me slumping over my desk. That was a decade ago and I still guzzle four or more cans of the stuff every day. (I only buy cans. Plastic bottles don't keep it cold. Glass bottles can be difficult to find.) That means that in the past 10 years, I've drunk about 14,500 330ml cans or almost 5,000 litres of the stuff. I figure that by the time I'm 60, I would have consumed the equivalent of a backyard swimming pool of bubbly, black liquid. It is not that I particularly like the taste. In truth, Diet Coke doesn't really taste like anything to me anymore. It almost tastes neutral, like water or milk. I don't drink it because I want to lose weight, but I always figured that I might as well save calories on fizzy drinks so I can splurge on chocolate and cakes. And since I don't drink coffee, I crave - really crave - the caffeine hit I get from a Coke. At best, I'm grumpy in the mornings before I've had my fix. At worst, boyfriends have been dispatched late at night in sheeting rain to find me a cold, silver can. I get irritable and distracted in foreign countries when I don't have a steady supply, and I once paid £5 for a single glass in a cafe in Florence. There's nothing natural about caramel-coloured carbonated water - and you almost need a chemistry degree to read the ingredients on the label - so even the most devoted Diet Coke drinker is unlikely to argue it's good for you. On the side of the can under \"nutritional information per 100ml\", there is the following list: \"carbohydrates 0.g; protein 0.g, fat 0.g energy, 0.4 cal\". There's no mention of vitamins. Small wonder. The aim of the exercise seems to be to carefully balance the ledger: you won't get anything of any nutritional value from this shiny can but, hey, you won't get any of those nasty calories either. But is Diet Coke actually bad for you? Once, a science reporter on a newspaper where I worked showed me a medical journal that said some diet drinks caused holes in the brains of lab rats. I drank mineral water that day, but soon resumed my ritual. I was 21. The obsession with liver cleansing diets, yoga and wheatgrass shots was still a few years off. And I needed to stay alert during late-night shifts. A few years ago an email doing the rounds claimed that aspartame - the sweetener used in many diet drinks - was responsible for a host of horrors including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and brain tumours. The email was signed by someone called Betty Martini and it claimed she had lectured at \"The World Environmental Conference\". That struck me as strange at the time, since I wouldn't have thought diet drinks were exactly an environmental issue. Still, I began to worry. Maybe those headaches are a brain tumour. Type \"aspartame\" into the Google internet search engine and you get 113,000 results, including links to an aspartame victims' support group and an official-sounding Aspartame Toxicity Centre. Earnest-sounding teenagers log on to chatrooms to describe walking three kilometres in a blizzard to get a can or being diagnosed with a stomach ulcer after drinking six litres of diet cola a day. The fanatics at aspartamekills.com claim the sweetener causes multiple sclerosis, lupus, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome and Gulf war syndrome. Bizarrely, the site also suggests that OJ Simpson was suffering from aspartame poisoning at the time of his wife's murder. Hardly compelling evidence. According to the folks at Coca-Cola this is all an unfortunate misunderstanding. For whatever reason, Diet Coke is the favourite target of conspiracy theorists, and Coca-Cola seems hurt by the suggestion it is peddling cancer in a can. Coke is, after all, \"life\" according to the company's marketing. Every reliable piece of available scientific information tells us that aspartame is a safe and suitable sweetener,\" its site says. \"Prior to its approval aspartame underwent one of the most thorough scientific reviews ever conducted.\" So what is the truth? Aspartame, found in NutraSweet and Equal brands, is made up of two amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. We consume these same amino acids in foods every day - from milk and fruits to vegetables - and, regardless of the source, the body digests them the same way. (There are some people who lack the necessary enzyme to process phenylalanine, and all babies born in the United Kingdom after 1969 were tested for this disorder at birth. For the one in 10,000 people born with this condition - phenylketonuria or PKU - foods with phenylalanine can cause mental retardation and seizures. All foods or beverages containing aspartame are required to bear warning labels.) There is no shortage of reputable medical organisations that say aspartame is safe. They include the Scientific Committee on Food in Brussels, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the American Medical Association. Aspartame was first used in the early 1970s (it was approved for use in the UK in 1982) and since then has been the subject of more than 200 studies. The Food Standards Agency, an independent food safety watchdog set up by the government in 2000, says that there is no reliable scientific evidence to back up claims that aspartame causes any of the serious disorders with which it has been linked. Experts have dismissed a 1996 study that suggested aspartame was responsible for a 10% rise in brain tumours in the US as \"flawed\", noting that among other things that the number of tumours had not increased. However, almost everyone who has had anything to do with aspartame controversy is awaiting the results of a three-year study at King's College in London into whether there is any link between aspartame and brain cancer. The authors of that study have been at pains to point out that it is not their intention to \"rubbish\" aspartame and, indeed, NutraSweet has said that it is confident the study, due to completed soon, will vindicate its product once and for all. Catherine Collins, the chief dietician at St George's Hospital and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says that despite the screeds of alarming information about aspartame on the internet she is comfortable about the sweetener precisely because it is made up of amino acids found naturally in other foods. Of much greater concern, Collins says, is saccharine - a sweetener that is used in other low-calorie foods and drinks that has caused bladder cancer in laboratory rats. While not exactly supporting chain drinking, Collins says that Diet Coke in moderation won't kill you. \"I wouldn't push soft diet drinks as healthy drinks, but I wouldn't be too worried about the aspartame either,\" she says. So does that mean I can drink as much Diet Coke as like? Not exactly. There is the small matter of caffeine; undoubtedly that's what I'm addicted to. It turns out that one cup of drip coffee has about 140mg of caffeine, whereas a diet drink usually has about 45. So, even if I drink five cans, I'll probably still be getting less caffeine than if I had two cups of coffee. But, like many foods containing artificial additives, there is a safe daily limit. An average adult should consume no more than 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight per day. To exceed the limit, most people would need to drink at least 14 cans of diet drinks a day. All of which makes my four-can-a-day habit seem quite pathetic. Fourteen cans a day? Now that's an addiction.

The book, a collection of aphorisms, memories and reflections on the past, is the first book in Quignard's trilogy of literary fragments, Dernier Royaume (Last Kingdom). Quignard reportedly said that he hadn't thought he would win because his book could not be easily defined. He told LCI television: \"It's a sequence of beginnings of novels, stories, landscapes, autobiographical fragments. It's not a novel or an essay.\" Quignard is perhaps best known for Tous les matins du monde (All the Mornings of the World), his book about an 18th century viola de gamba player which was made into a 1991 movie starring Gérard Depardieu. Other works include Le Salon de Wurtemberg (The Salon in Wurtemberg) and Terrasse à Rome (Terrasse in Rome), which received the French Academy prize in 2000. The Wandering Shadows was pitted against Oliver Rolin's Tigre en papier (Paper Tiger) and Gérard de Cortanze's Assam. In the third round of voting, the Goncourt jury members gave Quignard six votes, while Rolin and de Cortanze got two each. De Cortanze's novel, a historical adventure about a young man who sets off for the Assam tea growing region of India, won another top literary prize on Monday, the Renaudot.

Orders were laid before parliament to proscribe four organisations believed to be linked to al-Qaida, including the militant Indonesian group Jemaah Islamiyah. Mr Blunkett wants to add the four groups to a list of 21 international organisations already proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Also on today's list were the Abu Sayyaf group of Islamic extremists, responsible for a wave of kidnappings in the Philippines, Lebanon's Asbat Al-Ansar and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. British banks were last week ordered to freeze the assets of Jemaah Islamiyah while intelligence agencies attempt to establish the extent of its links with al-Qaida. Indonesian police today took the organisation's spiritual leader Abu Bakar Bashir from hospital for questioning about a string of church bombings in the south-east Asian state. Suspicions continue to surround Jemaah Islamiyah's possible involvement in the October 12 blasts in the holiday resort of Bali, which killed around 180 people. Sixteen Britons are now confirmed to have died in the blasts, with a further nine still missing, said the Foreign Office today. Mr Blunkett said: \"Recent events have served as a stark reminder that the danger posed by global terrorism has not gone away. Since the Terrorism Act 2000 came into force, just over 18 months ago, we have witnessed the devastating attacks in America and, only this month, atrocities in Bali and other parts of that region. \"Proscription is not a power to be used lightly. The government has always kept the list of proscribed organisations under constant review and after taking all the relevant factors into account, I am satisfied that these four groups should now be added to it. \"I believe this will send a clear message that the United Kingdom is committed to playing a leading role in the international campaign against terrorists and their supporters - whether operating here or broad.\" The order will be debated by MPs and peers later this week and will be subject to approval by both houses of parliament. The Terrorism Act 2000 makes membership, funding or support of a proscribed organisation a criminal offence. Jemaah Islamiyah wants to create a unified Islamic state in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern Philippines and is estimated to have around 200 members. In December 2001, 13 members were arrested in Singapore suspected of planning attacks against targets there, including the British Council and High Commission,and the US, Israeli, and Australian embassies. The Abu Sayyaf group appears to be aiming to establish an autonomous Islamic state in the southern Philippines island of Mindanao. It was formed in 1991 and has around 1,200 members. The group has been accused of being involved in a series of kidnappings of foreigners and last year conducted an armed raid on a holiday resort, taking 20 people hostage and killing two Americans. It is also suspected of bombing two department stores in Zamboanga in the Philippines earlier this month, killing seven and wounding 150. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan wants to establish a Taliban-style Islamic state. In February 1999 it launched a bombing campaign in Tashkent and is widely reported to have been given money and training by Osama bin Laden. Asbat Al-Ansar - the League of Partisans or Band of Helpers - was formed in 1985. It is a Sunni Muslim terrorist organisation, based primarily in the Lebanese Palestinian refugee camp Ain Al Hilweh and terrorist action has so far been limited to small-scale bombings and assassinations, always within Lebanon. The groups will be proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 that bans activities in the UK intended to aid terrorist actions overseas. The act has been criticised by civil liberties campaigners for potentially criminalising exiles fighting to topple a dictatorial regime in their homeland. But Britain has been criticised by governments abroad, including Saudi Arabia, for allowing London to be a haven for organisations regarded by the ruling regimes of their homelands as terrorists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2002/oct/28/usa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-28T12:12:14Z","webTitle":"US diplomat shot dead in Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/28/usa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/oct/28/usa","fields":{"headline":"US diplomat shot dead in Jordan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Gunmen killed a US diplomat today as he walked to his car at his home in a middle class neighbourhood in the Jordanian capital, Amman. The diplomat, identified by Jordanian security officials as Laurence Foley, had responsibilities in aid matters. The attack took place at about 7:30am local time (5.30am GMT). Jordan's information minister, Mohammed Affash Adwan, said: \"Gunmen sprayed the diplomat with several shots, killing him instantly.\" Mr Adwan declined to speculate on whether the attack was a terrorist incident but he said: \"This attack, regardless of its motives and reasons, is an aggression on Jordan and its national security ... we will not tolerate that at all.\" US embassy officials were not answering telephone calls but security officials said Mr Foley's wife had alerted police after the attack outside his home on Abdullah Ghosheh street, which is in a well-off district of Amman. Mr Foley, an official at the US agency for international development, was apparently shot as he headed for his car, a red Mercedes 300, parked in front of the two-storey, white stone house. There were blood stains on the ground near the driver's side door, but no broken glass, indicating he had not managed to get into the car. Police were searching the scene for fingerprints and other evidence. Jordan is known for tight security, but several attacks have been directed against Israelis in Amman and along the Jordanian-Israel border. Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab states that have peace treaties with Israel. The killing comes at a tense time in the Middle East, with many in the Arab world enraged with the US because of its push for a war to topple the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, and for what Arabs regard as biased support for Israel at the expense of the Palestinians. On September 27, the US government said it had received uncorroborated information indicating that, as of this summer, a member of the al-Qaida organisation was considering a plan to kidnap US citizens in Jordan. Richard Boucher, a US state department spokesman, said the government had no information to determine the credibility of the threat or any indication of the timing. However, he added that the US embassy in Jordan had notified Americans resident in the Arab kingdom about the report. Jordan's alliance with the US and the peace treaty signed with Israel in 1994 have made it a target for Muslim militants. Two years ago, a group of 28 Arab men plotted to use poisonous gas and explosives in attacks against Americans and Israelis in hotels and tourist sites during new year celebrations in Jordan. The plot was uncovered and foiled in November 1999. There were also reports that al-Qaida had planned to target King Abdullah II and his family as they holidayed on a yacht in the Mediterranean. Jordanian security evacuated the royal family after receiving a tipoff that a motorboat with explosives was to slam into the yacht in a plan similar to the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, in which 17 US sailors were killed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/oct/28/londonreviewofbooks","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-28T11:29:04Z","webTitle":"Sick as a parrot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/28/londonreviewofbooks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/oct/28/londonreviewofbooks","fields":{"headline":"Sick as a parrot","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spix's Macaw: The Race to Save the World's Rarest Bird by Tony Juniper. Fourth Estate, 296 pp., £16.99, 2 September, 1 84115 650 7 'Any form represented by few individuals,' Darwin wrote in The Origin of Species, 'will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction.' That both these words need qualifying should give us pause. Darwin could see the appeal of extinction; or rather, something about extinction appealed to him. When he describes the all-consuming struggle of species to survive and reproduce there is occasionally, lurking in his sentences, something about the all too human option of giving up. We are, after all, the animals that are making the seasons fluctuate and the animals with a genius for creating enemies. All our self-destructive behaviour, whatever else we think it is, may be an attempt to put a stop to the struggle. And if we begin to hate our own struggle for survival, we may want to suppress it in others. Clearly, our capacity to destroy other species - not to mention others that belong to our own species - was the most staggering fact of the last century. It is not surprising that it occurred to some people that there might be a secret struggle not to survive, that utter extinction might be our best chance. We have certainly had to come up with some very good stories to make the struggle for survival - and, indeed, struggle itself - seem worth it. The most compelling have tried to persuade us either that in some way or other the struggle is rewarded or that 'struggle' is not quite the right word for what we are doing. So we prefer to think of ourselves as pleasure-seeking, or exploring, or competing, or achieving (over or under) rather than merely struggling for a future that can never belong to us. As the only animals that have (articulated) reservations about the struggle we are, by the same token, the keenest and most ingenious at ending, once and for all, the struggle of other species to survive and reproduce. Our reckless, overreaching predatoriness - ourselves as the enemies of our own and only possible environment - is now something we take for granted about (modern) human nature. Putting the planet out of its misery has become the contemporary project, with money and religious beliefs the only things left worth conserving. So Spix's Macaw, which is many things - a detective story, a love story and a jeremiad - should be read as a sign of the times. What is so disturbing about it - and this is not news, but the way the story is told might make it news that stays news - is how hard people are prepared to struggle, in the name of profit and prestige, to kill what they claim to value, especially when it is rare. As Juniper so starkly shows, it is a mixed blessing to prize rarity: it makes people create rarity in order to prize it. Darwin helped us to take the extinction of species for granted. But his account of how and why it happens - without 'plan' or intelligence behind it - made it easier for us to wonder whether extinction mattered. We obviously don't want a world without lions or elephants or (some of) ourselves, but we could probably do without the odd wader. In this situation the species we choose to protect, to care about, must reveal something to us about the kind of animal we have ourselves become. If it isn't the case that everything that lives is holy or that all of the species we share the planet with - more than a hundred million of them - are enemies, then choosing to become the animals that conserve other species is itself an interesting piece of evolution. Extinction is one of the things that seems to happen in nature - in the tropical rainforests alone, according to E.O. Wilson, the number of species doomed each year is 27,000; each day it is 74, and each hour three - but there are things that can be done to offset it. So what is it about us that would make us bother to do something, as opposed to what is it about us that makes us carelessly and carefully destroy everything that gets in our way? This is not as clear as it should be. We are far more forthcoming about what we call our greed. Indeed, stories about our rapaciousness, both gleeful and guilty, are everywhere available; stories about the alternatives to greed have been poor in comparison. Greed may be a despair about appetite, but it has replaced original sin as the enemy within. So greed is now being blamed for the wholesale destruction of the environment when, as Tony Juniper shows, there are also individuals, and groups of individuals, making choices that have a bearing on the matter. There can be no life without a sustaining environment; but when people are perplexed about what sustains them, their choices about their environment become less and less intelligible. Spix's Macaw is about a group of people who, in the name of protecting and conserving a rare species of parrot, made it extinct in what is still called the wild. Like all such stories it either makes you wonder how people can do such terrible things, or it makes you wonder what else people might be up to in the doing of such things. It is big business to make resources scarce; and the so-called rare bird trade, as Juniper shows, tells you rather more about trade than it does about rare birds. There were often 'exotic birds' for sale in markets in the 1960s, and if you wanted something a bit special - hummingbirds or parrots, say, from South America, or tanagers from Africa - you could usually get them. And the people who could get these birds did not, on the whole, talk about saving the planet; but they were, the ones I knew, fascinated by just how beautiful and unusual the birds were - bulletins from a less drab world. The bird dealers were interested in birds in a way that drug dealers tend not to be interested in drugs. When I kept what were then called 'tropical birds' as a boy, well over thirty years ago, the trade was clearly illicit, but the dealers were people you could happily introduce to your middle-class parents. The rough-trade side of it all was very occasionally reported in the press - the stealing of young birds from nests, the huge losses involved in every shipment of birds from abroad - but most of the people I came across called themselves bird-lovers. Enthusiasts, not pale criminals or connoisseurs, tended to collect these birds. It couldn't have been as shady-genteel as I remember it, but it wasn't the viciously self-serving world that Juniper describes. In the 1980s, everything became dispensable. 'The last Spix's Macaw had been alone for 13 years; he had become,' Juniper writes, 'globally famous as the world's loneliest bird.' On 1 December 2000 the Brazilian government agency responsible for its protection put out a statement announcing that the Spix's Macaw was officially extinct in its natural environment. After 13 years the world's loneliest bird had finally disappeared. Celebrities are supposed to be lonely; and writing about other creatures - all the non-human nature that so outnumbers us - has traditionally consoled us by suggesting that 'they' are very like us, rather than the other way round. The other way round has always been a problem because it could only be described in (human) language. Asking what animals are like if and when they are not like us is also a way of asking what we are like if we are not as we describe ourselves. The animal kingdom has long been a device for our own self-reflection. And now we know that we are not like animals, but that we are animals, what animals are like has become an ever increasing concern, though observing nature for clues about who or what we are only results at best in more words. Indeed one reason parrots have been prized, as Juniper explains, is that like us, but unlike us, they speak (another is that they can be extraordinarily beautiful). Parrots talk but they only tell us what we have told them. This, apparently, has been making them irresistible for centuries. The many 'qualities' parrots have - 'a reputation for devotion, faithfulness and affection', 'an instinct for loyalty', a talent for mimicry, 'their astonishing and vivid beauty' - make them sound like versions of 'perfect partners', which good pets often are (and good partners usually aren't). And yet, as Juniper says in a chapter devoted to the history of their charms, 'the range and depth of their attractions... has paradoxically proved a curse... Parrots are today part of an illegal trade in wildlife that ranks third in value only to the multibillion-dollar clandestine drugs and arms markets.' Unsurprisingly, perhaps, 'the driving force behind the demand for the birds was rarity in captivity.' And when it came to parrots in particular, because they were such familiar exotic creatures, no one connected rarity in captivity to rarity in the wild. It wasn't merely that some species were difficult to locate and to catch (Spix's Macaw is appropriately and unsensationally horrifying in its accounts of the trapping and transporting of the birds): some were dying out because their environments were being destroyed in order to be 'developed', making the birds even more valuable commodities. By 1988, 71 of the 350 known species of parrots were officially listed as being at risk of extinction. The rarer the bird, the greater its price; wittingly, or unwittingly, the traders and the collectors have a vested interest in risking the extinction of the species they want. The parrots closest to extinction were the four species of blue macaw, of which Spix's was the rarest. 'Outstanding even among the parrots,' Juniper writes, 'for charisma, charm and visual impact the blue macaws... have been doomed by their unique qualities to become one of humanity's most prized possessions.' Not just punished for their virtues, the blue macaws were doomed. We have never been quite puzzled enough by the fact that we kill the things we love; that prizing things usually means prising them away. For Spix's Macaw there were, Juniper writes without undue melodrama, and on behalf of all the remaining parrots, 'just a few last moves... left as a final prelude to more than fifty million years of evolutionary memory being wiped away for good'. Juniper's phrase suggests that evolution is worth remembering; and that it is part of our own evolution to have acquired memory. So what we choose to conserve about ourselves and our environment tells us something about the nature of our contemporary needs. It seems obvious, in crude economic terms, why people continue to destroy environments to profit from raw materials; why corporate enterprise tries to persuade us with creation myths - myths about the creation of wealth and jobs - though destruction is what is actually happening; and why the poorer people in a given place want to make large sums of money from what is for them the local flora and fauna (Hyacinth Macaws, one of the four blues, have a retail value of more than $15,000). What has become increasingly difficult is to give an effective account of the reasons the so-called natural world is worth conserving. Business and government have been notably unimpressed by science or sentiment on this particular issue. What would 'natural resources' be for - how would we describe them - if they were not commodities, or commodities in the making? This is the difficulty that Juniper and his colleagues keep coming up against in their nearly failed attempt to keep the rarest of parrots in circulation, and not merely in economic circulation. That the natural world could be there for anything other than our gain, material or otherwise, has always been difficult to imagine. We tend to think of ourselves, whether we are 'nature lovers' or not, as getting something from it, if we can. When Dr Johan Baptist Ritter von Spix, a Bavarian polymath, set out for Rio de Janeiro in 1817 to study and collect the native fauna, he was sponsored by his King: Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria was, Juniper tells us, 'a bird collector in his own right' and hoped that Spix 'would bring him novel and unique prizes' from the expedition. Rare birds, and especially parrots, had been kept, at least since the Romans, as what we would now call status symbols ('so valuable did they become,' Juniper notes, 'that they were often sold for more than the price of a human slave... Noblemen carried the birds through the streets of Rome as a colourful accessory'). Plumage and empires are inextricable. In his apparently benign plunder, undertaken in the interests of science and his King, Spix managed, despite the incredible hardships of his expedition, to bring back a vast array of creatures, dead and alive. Among them was 'a magnificent long-tailed blue parrot', shot for the collection. 'It lives,' Spix wrote in his journal, 'in flocks, although very rare, near Juazeiro in the region bordering the Sao Francisco, and is notable for its thin voice.' What this unusual bird, with its thin voice unlike that of other macaws, got was Spix's name, and the beginning of its end. Spix, Juniper writes, 'didn't realise that he had just taken the very first specimen of a bird that would one day symbolise how human greed and ignorance were wiping countless life-forms from the record of creation'. There would never be such innocence again. To be named and officially recorded proved to be what Juniper calls, rather mildly, 'a mixed blessing': 'It intrigued not only scientists but also conservationists and collectors, the former seeking to save the species, the latter to own and possess the most sought-after of all birds.' Recognition was very nearly the prelude to extinction for Spix's obscure object of desire. The question is: in what way would it have been better for us if it had never been seen at all? As it happened, it wasn't seen at all for 84 years after Spix had first seen and shot one. In 1903 Othmar Reiser saw several during an Austrian Academy of Sciences expedition to north-eastern Brazil. Though they were extremely rare in Brazil they were, as Juniper puts it, 'certainly leaving Brazil for a life in captivity overseas'. After Reiser's sighting there was only one other, in 1938, and 'the species was not heard from again in the wild until the 1970s.' The bird was leading a double life, privately in the wild, and publicly as a special acquisition in a few zoos and private collections. And it was during the 1970s that demand for the birds increased, and 'the openness with which collectors declared the ownership of such rare creatures sharply declined.' Despite national and international legislation banning the export of wildlife, the flow of macaws out of the country couldn't be controlled by the Brazilian authorities: 'the trafficking was increasingly secret, the volume of commerce and the final destinations for birds being captured was unknown to anyone but a few dealers, trappers and rare-parrot collectors.' The only hope, apart from wholehearted government protection, was collaboration and co-operation among the wealthy collectors. As Juniper remarks in passing, people don't tend to get that rich by being flexible, accommodating and disinterested. These wealthy individuals were unusually free to 'determine their own \"conservation\" priorities': 'conservation' in quotation marks because most of the wealthy rare-bird collectors referred to here were interested only in conserving their own eccentric independence and prestige. 'The deathblow for Spix's Macaw was the result,' as Juniper shows in unsparing detail, 'of the disastrous clash of human styles, egos, pride and vested interests.' Spix's Macaw is compelling partly because Juniper can be passionate about the birds and what their story represents without needing to demonise the villains of the piece - his concerns about conservation are not the usual secularised religiosity - so it is of some interest that the shady characters in the book, and there are many, become too dark even for him. He is mindful of the fact that only money can save the species that are dying out (though not money alone) and that by the same token it is the rich, with all their freedom to be contradictory, who are collecting and collecting up the rarest species. Perhaps the most devastating paragraphs in Spix's Macaw are Juniper's straightforward accounts of the words and actions of the 'elite' bird collectors. Declaring that 'Brazilian bird protection is a joke,' one of these men casually reveals a recent offer made to him of 50 Hyacinth Macaw chicks taken from the wild. Although he laments that Hyacinth Macaws are 'well on their way to being extinct', he evidently sees no contradiction between that thought and his personal ownership of the rarest blue macaws. He also showed no sense of irony when he suggested that those smuggling rare parrots should face 'the stiffest penalties'. There are three ways of protecting endangered species. One is to protect them in and with their environment; the second is to breed them in captivity in newly created artificial environments; the third, which combines the other two, is to breed them in captivity and reintroduce them into the wild. Money is the constraining factor, once a plausible rationale has been provided for the conservation project. But the second two options are also constrained by genetics, because the rarer the species the greater the likelihood of inbreeding. Hamsters, as Juniper tells us, have been our inspiration here; all the Golden Hamsters in the world come from three siblings, two brothers and a sister, taken from a wild nest in Syria in 1930. There are now millions of them. With Spix's Macaws, though, the stud books were mishandled and that, combined with sabotage on the part of collectors, had the effect of thwarting a well-worked out and internationally co-ordinated project to breed the birds in captivity and reintroduce them into their natural habitat. The narrowing gene pool was not in itself an insurmountable obstacle. The obstacle, in Juniper's view, was 'the people who are obsessed by owning blue macaws. The men who have so consistently and ruthlessly sought to cage and control these creatures have between them ultimately destroyed the object of their desires. Although it appears this was not their intention, it has nonetheless been the result.' It must, though, have been their intention, because it was the predictable and inevitable outcome of their actions: unless the breeding programme for rare birds was supported, all the birds would die out. Blaming people may not be the most morally impressive thing we do, but it keeps alive the sense in which people can be held responsible for at least some of their actions. The challenge left by Juniper's book is how one would go about persuading someone who didn't already take it for granted of the importance of conservation; of valuing a time before and after one's own time; of respecting rather than disowning one's affinity for other living creatures. To be the only creatures that are concerned about all the other creatures in the world sounds unnatural; but to describe ourselves as that part of nature that is intent on destroying nature sounds a little too theological. Spix's Macaw suggests that a private collection, at least of wildlife, may turn out to be a contradiction in terms, a dangerous nonsense akin to the idea of a private language. Rich and rare rare-bird collectors turn their birds into extinct currency. In Juniper's account the unscrupulous ingenuity, the boastfully good intentions of these people seem, knowingly or unknowingly, to be a form of hatred, given that the result of their tenaciousness is that beautiful rare creatures are forbidden to exist. Besides, if, as this grim tale suggests, part of the pleasure of collecting rare objects is the pleasure of depriving others of the pleasure they might take in them, then depriving all others, for ever, must be among the pleasures of collecting rare species of wildlife. Spix's Macaw, in other words, is as much about desire as it is about parrots. It is fortunate for us that parrots cannot really talk. The increasing demand for rare species and the way rarity increases demand looks like a zero-sum game. It will be called investing in extinction, and it will be the only thing left to invest in. Rare parrots - the dead parrot sketch - are, as Juniper's book makes abundantly clear, emblematic victims of a terrible project. · Adam Phillips has edited the new Penguin Freud. · To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

The step change in programme investment - an extra £25m into this year's schedule and another £60m next year - is welcome proof that shareholders' hearts and minds are back focused on the core business of free-to-air television. The Carlton-Granada merger, when it happens, will move ITV on and up. A competitive autumn schedule, Nigel Pickard's imaginative appointment as director of programmes at the network, and a confident new on-screen identity launched today, complete the picture of an ITV back fighting. Good news as this all is, it is only the start of a long haul. Everyone agrees that ITV's fractured ownership and management structure has kept it back from operating at full strength to give viewers and advertisers best value. Single-minded focus has to replace the multiple and often conflicting shareholder agendas of the past. The fatal distraction of ITV Digital cost a great deal more than money. ITV1 paid dearly for lack of schedule investment and the absence of a united front to meet the encroaching competition. Not least of the tasks ahead is convincing competition regulators that the new, improved ITV won't also be an unfriendly giant in the marketplace, fleecing advertisers and squeezing smaller channels. (Advertisers love strong, distinctive and successful programmes but they love strong, successful broadcasters less. The trouble is they come as a package.) Squaring the competition authorities may be the front-of-mind task, but there are a couple of other issues bubbling under the surface that deserve quality management time if ITV is to stay on the right track as it moves towards final consolidation. One is structural, the other is cultural, but they both amount to the same thing in the end. The ongoing challenge is to make sense of the ITV paradox: the structural dysfunction we're all desperate to sweep away is also ITV's glorious heritage and its unique selling proposition in the public service ecology. Centralise management and production under one owner and you dislodge the regional dynamic that has been ITV for the best part of 50 years. From today, we're replacing regional on-screen \"idents\" in all the English regions with new integrated ITV1 branding around all but regional programmes. For those who still mourn the passing of the Anglia knight and for whom Meridian will be forever Southern, this is an act of metropolitan vandalism that proves ITV has already merged into a broadcasting super-state. But these are only the ghostly symbols of the past. What really matter are the programmes and the personalities in the regions that viewers regard highly and rely on. There is no reason why, with proper investment, these programmes and the talent that gets them to the screen can't thrive within a strong, unified ITV. And, just as important to the network, why talent based outside London can't continue to break through the magic M25 circle to get their work seen everywhere in the UK. This has always been part of ITV's unstuffy, anti-metrocentric appeal and can be still. But to make it work in future we have to think about the twin functions of ITV - network and regional - in a more joined-up way. This has to come from within ITV itself and won't be solved by grafting on a new layer of regional quotas. Back in its rich dysfunctional past, ITV was never short of charismatic leaders who came up through the creative side of the business. There were committees full of them and they were invariably at each other's throats, defending to the death the right of their regional baronies to get their programmes the best slots on the network. These regular punch-ups didn't aid clear strategic vision or even, from time to time, make the most commercially effective schedule, but this didn't matter because in a monopoly the revenue pretty much took care of itself. Creative people were in charge, regional plurality reigned supreme and the test of your worth in the market was your programme metal not your share price. ITV is a different country these days and consolidation can only push it further towards the goal of business perfection. But television has a purpose beyond profits and it calls for a special kind of vision and leadership that not only maximises shareholder value but also delivers cultural value. As ITV becomes more like any other business, I hope Michael Green and Charles Allen will keep the cultural as well as the commercial end in their sights. Both of these are down to the programmes and the people who make them. All the more so if those programmes tap into the tremendous creative energy that flows as vitally throughout all parts of the United Kingdom as it does in London.

That, at least, is the claim the people at UK History in their wisdom are making, to boost the launch of their TV channel on Wednesday. Oh dear. First brown was the new black, then (correct me if I'm wrong) purple, then white; later it was (confusingly) black and now (even more confusingly) it's history. This is nutty stuff - about as bonkers as the claim a few years ago that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. It wasn't. But still. History is hip, sexy and on-message. Last year, history books outsold cookery books for the first time. Three Hollywood studios are currently battling over the rights to make a movie about Alexander the Great. Gladiator, a film that revived Hollywood's 40-year-old fetish for stout-thighed Romans in short skirts, was an Oscar-soaked success. The UK History press pack suggestively claims that the decline in the study of history at both A-Level and beyond has been dramatically reversed recently. Why are these things happening? According to Simon Schama, who has been roped in by the channel to help promote its launch, history has become fashionable partly because \"it's a kind of antidote to the kind of wobbly indeterminacy of cyberspace\". What does that mean? \"Everything's so fast-fast - people moving jobs, run the computer faster, give me the fastest possible cheeseburger I can possibly get. History is slow-slow. It's about slowing down, finding where we are in the bigger scheme of things, a bit more thoughtful, making connections with people who came before.\" This, though, doesn't explain all the appeal of a TV history series like A History of Britain. It makes history sound rather earnest, and that was one thing Schama's series - for good or ill - was not. He's nearer to the mark in appreciating its appeal, surely, when he says this: \"People have been waiting for a big epic - I won't say pageant - but something that was unapologetically epic about our national identity. There was a tremendous craving for the big sense of where we came from.\" If some critics had misgivings about this way of doing history, those concerns have been rather lost in the critical enthusiasm for programmes, like Schama's and David Starkey's, that make history into a series of arc light-tinted spectacles. In the new sexy world of TV history, though, there is no space for disputes between historians. Given a choice between a series in which historians argue about the merits of the British Empire, and one about why George IV became so fat, narrated by Carol Vorderman with tips on how he should have dieted, no TV producer would choose the former. Instead, for the most part on TV, one man's narrative (and it overwhelmingly is a man's) goes uncontested. And that's why Schama and Starkey have become such stars. Their way of doing history - focusing on dramatic incident, relating the lives of the rich and powerful - translates readily to television. Were EP Thompson or EH Carr alive today, they wouldn't be such prime-time darlings. No matter. A History of Britain and Starkey's series The Six Wives of Henry VIII, it seems, arrived on our screens at an ideal moment. Matt Tombs, launch director of UK History, says that \"the turn of the new millennium naturally fostered a period of reappraisal\". After an introspective 90s, a contemplative millennium and the new seriousness allegedly brought about by September 11, an appreciation of history became more important. At the same time, he claims, the United Kingdom has a growing need to define and express its sense of national identity at a time when, thanks to globalisation, devolution and increasing European integration, that identity risked disappearing altogether. These currents converged at a time when history on TV was becoming a very different beast. \"History programming anticipated that surge in interest,\" says Tombs, \"and historians raised their game as a result.\" But the popularity of TV history programmes was the broadcasting shock of the new millennium, particularly as it happened at a time when the medium increasingly privileged thick exhibitionists and fatuous makeover shows, and intelligent people despaired of it. \"Simon Schama and David Starkey have shaken up the genre on television with their enthusiasm and gravitas,\" says the UK History press pack, \"engaging the viewer through storytelling and dramatic reconstruction.\" A History of Britain, they point out, was a media sensation - 3.3 million people watched it, and it was also a merchandising goldmine for the BBC - thousands bought the spin-off books and spoken-word tapes. It is succeeded by the rise of that sub-genre called \"experiential history\" - such programmes as The Ship and The Trench that purportedly gave their 21st-century participants and viewers a sense of what it was like to sail on Captain Cook's Endeavour or live in a first world war trench. \"Programmes like these\", says Tombs, \"are connecting with a new audience for history.\" This new audience, he believes, includes children hitherto \"disenfranchised\" from history in schools. Tombs reckons school history has amounted to \"learning facts and regurgitating them. What TV history is doing is opening up those worlds, enthusing them about history, making them realise the magic of history and the great stories that are there that they didn't get at school.\" But will these new audiences watch a dedicated history channel, broadasting 18 hours a day, seven days a week, to digital, cable and satellite viewers? \"I think it's great,\" says Schama, \"there's a custom-built station for people who can't get enough history.\" Well, yes, but there's a problem with that - there already is such a station. It's called The History Channel, has been running in Britain for seven years and the people who run it are furious. UK History is part of the UK TV family, a clutch of channels including UK Gold, UK Horizons, UK Food and UK Style. It is a commerical joint venture between the BBC and Flextech Television, which is a division of Telewest Communications. Geoff Metzger, managing director of the History Channel in the UK, says: \"In the 70s and 80s there was a concern that the BBC had to be protected from the market. Now, though, we're concerned that the market has to be protected from the BBC, which is behaving in a very predatory manner.\" What upsets Metzger is not just that he fears UK History will be directly competing against his own channel, but that the competition is unfair. \"We're worried that they will drive up the prices for TV rights, while at the same time the BBC will give them exclusive access to its product.\" He is particularly concerned that UK History will bid for an exclusive rights package for history series from the Channel 4 library, such as those by David Starkey, in a deal that would extend Channel 4's brand. Is there a parallel here with the impact of BBC4 on the independent Artsworld channel, where the launch of the former spelled the doom of the latter, not least because BBC4 was backed by a vast corporation, funded overwhelmingly from the licence fee? Geoff Metzger hopes not. \"It's not quite the same as the Artsworld scenario. They got burned with a licence-fee-funded channel. It's tough to argue against that. If the BBC wants to create licence-fee-funded channels, that's part of their remit. But when the BBC creates exclusive access for its product as it is with UK History, that skews the market and is to the detriment of everybody else.\" But how different will UK History be from the History Channel? Matt Tombs says that UK History will chiefly target a 30-plus ABC1 male audience, people who are \"not heavy viewers of factual TV\". To grab this demographic, Tombs aims to have cunningly devised schedules - if it's Thursday, it must be Hitler. It will also have week-long specials tied into historically significant events - this month there will be a Kennedy week linked to the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Missile crisis, next month there will be a Tutankhamun week to mark the 80th anniversary of Howard Carter's discovery of the ancient Egyptian's tomb. Over at the History Channel, Metzger says that he doesn't intend to tamper with his schedules in response to UK History's launch. \"We're going to keep doing what we do well. And we'll be doing a lot of things they won't. One thing is involving the viewers. We have taken great pains and gone to a lot of expense to encourage our viewers to participate, whether it be by developing an archive of 12,000 photographs from people around the UK, an oral history project, working the with the Royal British Legion, having viewer events, or helping history students with revision questions on our website.\" UK History so far does not have such commitments, still less can it afford to promise that it will produce new programmes itself. Instead, it will chiefly be about creating cleverly arranged thematic schedules. But if history is to remain the new black, ie to stay popular and fashionable, it will have to be about more than tinkering with the schedules. Otherwise, on TV at least, history will be doomed to repeat itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2002/oct/28/weather.climatechange2","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-28T01:43:50Z","webTitle":"Peril on land and sea as Atlantic storm takes country by surprise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2002/oct/28/weather.climatechange2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2002/oct/28/weather.climatechange2","fields":{"headline":"Peril on land and sea as Atlantic storm takes country by surprise","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Met Office may have issued severe weather warnings but the impact of the Atlantic storm which blasted across Britain, claiming six lives, caught most of the country by surprise and caused widespread disruption to transport yesterday. In terms of wind speeds and damage inflicted, the weather system was comparable to the severe gale which lashed southern counties two years ago and was then said to have been one of the worst to strike the United Kingdom since the great storm of 1987. A phlegmatic forecaster from the Met Office at Bracknell yesterday described it as the \"sort of thing you get every couple of years in southern England\". He denied they were becoming more frequent. But the death toll, the large number of uprooted trees and thousands of homes without electricity made it seem anything but commonplace. Adding ignominy to injury, the Royal Navy's most up to date warship, HMS St Albans, was holed above the waterline in Portsmouth harbour. The type 23 frigate, due to have sailed today for final preparations before sea trials, was rammed by a P&amp;O ferry, the Pride of Portsmouth, as it manoeuvred to dock. No one was hurt. A navy spokesman said the frigate suffered \"significant damage to its superstructure\" and a gash to its bows. In the western approaches, fierce winds whipped up heavy seas. Two RAF helicopter crews battled 80mph winds to lift an unconscious fisherman from the deck of a Spanish trawler, the Playa de Samil, 170 miles south-west of the Isles of Scilly. The sailor, who regained consciousness, was suffering from internal bleeding and was carried to the Trelisk hospital in Truro, Cornwall, following a seven-hour rescue mission. Dover Port closed its harbour and the fourth Clipper 2002 round the world yacht race, due to start from the River Mersey in Liverpool yesterday, was postponed for 24 hours to let the storm blow over. On land, the highest wind speed was recorded at 96.6mph at Mumbles, in south Wales, at around 7am. By way of comparison, the strongest gust in the 1987 storm, which killed 18 people and felled 15m trees, was measured at 122mph at Gorleston in Norfolk. The Association of British Insurers estimated that the cost to the industry of the weekend's weather would be heavy. \"We are talking tens of millions of pounds in the level of claims,\" a spokesman said, \"up to £50m, rather than hundreds of millions\". By comparison, insurance companies paid out more than £1bn compensation for the October 1987 storm and nearly £2bn after the storm of January 1990. For much of yesterday, the wind sustained speeds of 40 to 60mph, equivalent to between force eight and 10 on the Beaufort scale, as low clouds scudded across the sky, delivering showers and bursts of sunshine. Force 10 winds, once described as a storm but now redefined as a \"whole gale\", are capable of causing considerable structural damage, breaking off large branches and uprooting some trees. Transport systems were severely disrupted. The police, fire brigades and coastguard services in southern England, Wales, East Anglia and the Midlands warned people not to venture out unless their journey was absolutely necessary. British Airways cancelled 39 flights from Heathrow and Gatwick; another 30 were grounded at Stansted airport. High winds forced police to close the M48 Severn Bridge, leaving the second crossing reduced to one lane only with a 30mph speed limit. GNER and Virgin Trains, the mainline train operators on the east coast and west coast routes, cancelled all their services because of damage to overhead electricity lines and debris on the tracks. No replacement bus services were made available because of police advice about the safety of travel on the roads. Wales experienced some of the most severe weather. A church roof was blown off in Powys, a caravan with its owner inside was tumbled on to a railway line near Aberystwyth and roads were closed near the BT tower in Cardiff after panels on the upper floors were blown out. On the M4, traffic was diverted off at the Swansea bridge. The Snowdonia marathon was cancelled for the first time in its 21-year history. More than 1,000 runners from all over the world were due to take part. Power cuts were reported in Gloucestershire after falling trees cut cables. Several theme parks, including Alton Towers in Staffordshire, Chessington World of Adventures and Thorpe Park in Surrey, were closed for safety reasons. Scheduled ferry sailings in the Irish and North seas were cancelled. In London, parts of the Central underground line and the Docklands Light Railway were closed. The race meeting at Aintree in Liverpool did not take place because of high winds. In Northern Ireland, where some areas had up to an inch of rain overnight, the main coast road between Larne and Glenarm in east Antrim and the Newry road out of Kilkeel, Co Down, were blocked by fallen trees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2002/oct/28/tvandradio.television","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-28T01:43:21Z","webTitle":"Postmortem Pat investigates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/oct/28/tvandradio.television","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2002/oct/28/tvandradio.television","fields":{"headline":"Postmortem Pat investigates","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arts programmes have always been expected to have a more supportive attitude to their subjects than, say, the relationship between news shows and politicians. The title of an ITV cultural round-up - Celebration - captured the frequent tone. So it's rather bracing to find Omnibus (Wednesday, 10.35pm, BBC1) accusing a great artist of being a serial killer. Walter Sickert has been fingered as Jack the Ripper before because their dates broadly match, he liked to paint naked women in a state near death or sleep, and was possessed of an imagination which led him to change his name to Richard so that he could sign himself \"Dick Sick\". But, until now, his investigators have largely been well-mannered English art historians. In this Omnibus, Dick Sick comes up against the woman affectionately nicknamed, in English publishing, Postmortem Pat: the best-selling writer of forensic thrillers, Patricia Cornwell. Taking a hiatus from her books about the pathologist Dr Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell decided to investigate the Jack the Ripper murders. Such is the income of an American best-seller - we see Cornwell in her personal helicopter, private jet, red Ferrari and monogram-bottomed swimming pool - that Cornwell was able to spend $6m on reopening the case the Whitechapel plods never solved. Cornwell's money comes from having a populist touch, and she brings an entirely new approach to arts documentary. If Melvyn Bragg remarked on Ted Hughes's view of nature, you wouldn't expect him to cut open a sheep. But here was Postmortem Pat, lugging bags of offal into her kitchen and draping them with women's clothes. She then frenziedly stabbed the cardiganned kidneys to show what the victims of the Ripper/Sickert had endured. At this point, Francis Whately's film threatened to invite comparison with offal, but Cornwell's subsequent thrusts were more subtle and made me feel much less liverish about the film. Beginning with the prejudice that the Sickert suspicion was old and discredited, I was gradually swayed by what Cornwell's vast expenditure revealed: a partial DNA connection and a convincing graphic connection between a doodle on a Ripper letter and a Sickert picture. The revelation that the artist was himself mutilated - providing motivation for the slicings which gave the Ripper his name - also challenged my scepticism. Cornwell's early books about Scarpetta carried more intelligence and darkness than most popular crime novels, and her documentary also kept transcending its mass-audience ambitions. You wouldn't want too many arts programmes on these lines - The South Bank Show should not shift across London to become The Scotland Yard Show - but this one was an appealing experiment. Any Britons still convinced that Americans have the lock on television comedy should watch The Office (Monday, 10pm, BBC2) which, in this fifth episode of the second series, confirms that Ricky Gervais has gone beyond sitcom to create a new genre which can only be called sit-trag. Though one of the central jokes is the repetition of bureacracy, The Office has always been impressive in its ability to find slight variations on the daily sameness. Setting this one during Comic Relief Day - with the boss in a red nose and Gareth being sponsored to hop everywhere - was inspired. It maximised Brent's chief delusion - that he should be at the Palladium rather than on a payroll - at the very moment that he suffered his worst professional humiliation. Gervais likes to claim in interviews that he's never read a book, but the final scenes are a middle-management Twelfth Night: even to the extent that Brent happens to be wearing a ridiculous yellow costume. Next week, the Malvolio of Slough goes lower even than that into a sitcom King Lear as Brent's kingdom slips from him. It's also fitting that a walk-on part this week allows a bow to be taken by Stephen Merchant, Gervais's co-writer and co-director, who has tended to be overlooked by critics. Moving from a fictional joke about observational documentary to a real-life gag about reality TV, The Osbournes (Friday, 9.30pm, Channel 4) - which puts us at home with the family behind Black Sabbath - finally transfers to a mainstream channel from MTV, where it had the remarkable status of a show which few could see but which millions could read about because of the ecstatic coverage from the press. Lucky enough to have had an MTV preview tape in the programme's underground months, I watched the one now sent out by Channel 4, and can report that The Osbournes is among those shows which pass the test of second viewing. In fact, it may even improve, because you pick up on the oddities you missed. In common with many current hit American shows (The West Wing, Frasier, Six Feet Under), the narrative drive of The Osbournes is the gap between public and private behaviour. It was always quite funny that rock's self-styled Prince of Darkness was a Brummie, and it's even more amusing to discover him as a put-upon dad and bumbling husband in Beverly Hills. Ozzy, almost deaf from decades of heavy-metal gigs and befuddled from his drug and drink years, is a Homeric (as in Simpson) hero. The only problem for viewers joining the party this late is that our knowledge that Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy's wife, was later diagnosed with cancer overshadows the joyful daffiness of the show. It's a reminder that, while real-life drama may be cheaper than the acted kind, the drawback is that the characters are less controllable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2002/oct/27/highereducation.news","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-27T02:02:44Z","webTitle":"Television: Great pretenders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/oct/27/highereducation.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2002/oct/27/highereducation.news","fields":{"headline":"Great pretenders","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Great Britons: The Top 100 BBC2 Great Britons: Brunel BBC2 Great Britons: Darwin BBC2 Fame and Fashion: Inside Versace C4 Back in the days when she presented Points of View, Anne Robinson displayed a sure talent for raising a quizzical eyebrow. Time passed and Anne, a small woman who nurtured large ambitions, went on to develop other talents. Now she can raise two quizzical eyebrows at the same time. The question that both seemed to pose in Great Britons: The Top 100 was: Will they ever come down again? Located a good couple of inches above where you might expect to see a pair of eyebrows, they appeared stranded mid-forehead, unable to find their way home. There will be those who will claim this unorthodox positioning was simply a reaction to discovering that Michael Crawford had been voted the seventeenth greatest Briton of all time. Not me. First of all, Crawford's work in Some Mothers Do Have 'Em, not to mention Phantom of the Opera (in which he had to wear a good deal of troublesome make-up), plainly earned him his position above such chancers as Charles Dickens and Michael Faraday. And, second, Anne wore the same expression from the start of the programme, a whole two hours before she got to Crawford. If the idea was to look even scarier than usual, it worked a treat, or a trick or treat. There was something lupine, almost werewolfish, about this new-look Anne. At any rate, she made you want to howl. The show was one of the better programmes of its kind, with sharper celebrity pundits than we are used to on, say, The Top Ten Kitsch Things of The Seventies. Best of all were the responses of the handful of people on the list who were interviewed. They had, at least, to attempt not to take their presence seriously, and some attempts were less successful than others. The DJ John Peel (forty-third greatest Briton since chronicles began) trotted out the trademark self-deprecation that seems more like self-appreciation with each passing year. Richard Branson could not bring himself, despite the performance of his trains, to say that his placing at number 85 was undeserved. David Attenborough (63) got it about right. 'I am famous, that's all,' he said. 'And fame is really the most trivial quality.' In Great Britons: Brunel, I expected to see one of the greatest feats of engineering ever achieved in this country. But, alas, the presenter Jeremy Clarkson was not wearing his jeans. That, however, was the programme's single disappointment. Clarkson was on top form, showing what a first-rate broadcaster he can be when he resists the call of self-parody. There are 10 nominees for greatest Briton, and Clarkson's job was to argue the case for Isambard Kingdom Brunel, engineer, architect, shipbuilder, visionary. He did so not only with magnificent passion but also magnified perception. Getting down to the nuts and bolts of the subject, Clarkson made vivid the epic scale of Brunel's endeavours. Handsome photography, a cogent thesis, and trenchant wit did full justice to the engineer's cause and no harm to presenter's either. 'Darwin had told the world where we had come from,' said Clarkson, in summary, 'but Brunel had done something much more important: he took us to where we were going.' Over to you, Andrew Marr. In Great Britons: Darwin, Marr defended his man by pointing out that real greatness was about 'intellectual courage', and that the British Isles had produced 'many local heroes [but] only one world-changer'. The more I thought about that statement, the less true it sounded. In fact, the whole programme rang a little hollow. We've grown used to Marr, drenched and bedraggled outside the Houses of Parliament, gesticulating like a racecourse bookie, so one cannot overestimate the disorienting effect of seeing the wee Scotsman striding about beneath the brilliant sunshine of the Galapagos Islands in a pair of Bermuda shorts. Yet the problems in this documentary lay more with its failure to reveal Charles Darwin's genius than its success in exposing Marr's legs. Surprisingly, given the wealth of material available, there was no visual representation of natural selection that served to explain the idea. And an actor's dramatisation of the great man's life was, like so many such dramatisations, false and clumsy. Would a Victorian of Darwin's education really have said 'less' when he meant 'fewer'? Marr is an inspired political correspondent and, as he demonstrates on his BBC4 show, no slouch as an intellect, but he never really came across here and neither, as a result, did Darwin. I kept thinking about Rosie Boycott during both programmes. The poor woman will try to persuade us that Diana is the most important individual in British history. Personally, I'd sooner back Michael Crawford. I also thought about her during Fame and Fashion: Inside Versace, in which the late princess made an appearance, along with her nemesis, Camilla Parker Bowles. Is it too late for Boycott to pull out? This was not a production that shared Attenborough's outlook on fame. It was written and presented by David Furnish, otherwise known as Elton John's boyfriend, and featured a lot of celebrities competing to pay the most insincere compliment to Donatella Versace, the head of the Italian fashion house. There was a strong international field, including Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Lopez and Puff Daddy, but no clear winner, although Griffith did gush something that called into question the very concept of evolution. Amoebae have made more sense. The most precious line came from J-Lo. 'It's not so much about what she has as how she gives it,' she said of Versace, who seemed to have had a couple of golf balls inserted in her upper cheeks. 'And that to me is a very beautiful thing.' J-Lo, of course, is a connoisseur of others' generosity. The multimillionaire singer and actress tends not to function unless she and her entourage are bathed in freebies. Why it should be that extremely wealthy people get a kick out of receiving free goods was not a topic Furnish saw fit to explore. That may have been related to the fact that he and his boyfriend are regular beneficiaries of Versace's largesse. A less resilient interviewee than Donatella would have squirmed under Furnish's interrogation. Say what you like about this woman, she showed not a flicker of discomfort as her interviewer figuratively probed her bottom with his tongue. Here is a typical example of his questioning technique: 'If actresses and celebrities and models want to go out and make an impact and get noticed, there's no clothing that does that better than Versace.' (Note the absence of a question.) Donatella's response: 'Thank you for telling me that, but it's true.' Jeremy Paxman need live in no fear of his job. Furnish had only one insight to offer. Fashion houses, he explained eight or nine times, want celebrities to wear their clothes because it brings media attention and therefore greater sales. Who would have thought it? This was not an examination of the mutually profitable relationship between corporate brands and famous profiles so much as an example of it. Directed like an inflight infommercial, it had far less integrity than the adverts that interrupted it. At least they did not dress themselves up as something they were not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
