In countries like Nigeria diesel-powered generators are the default back-up for chronic, daily national power cuts. Tesla’s Powerwall battery works as a back-up that is not reliant on fossil fuels. It stores renewable energy like solar and wind and can last more than 24 hours. All this at no cost other than the upfront cost of the Powerwall itself. For Africa’s energy consumers and low-income groups, affordability is the main hurdle for the Powerwall’s adoption. Tesla’s 7-kilowatt-hours (kWh) capacity battery costs $3,000 upfront, excluding installation. Average per-capita incomes across sub-Saharan Africa mostly fall below $3,000, and it costs Africans much more to access energy than in many parts of the developing world. The continent remains hugely dependent on expensive fossil fuel sources for primary energy consumption, while renewable energy still accounts for only 20% of installed generation capacity, despite recent progress. Other new energy solutions have proved cost-effective, for instance, mobile pay-as-you-go solar power services. Under the model, pioneered by companies like Azuri Technologies, users pay a one-off installation fee of around $10 for a solar panel that can power two LED lights. The pack also includes a phone-charging device. The total weekly cost is about $1.50, which is at least 50% lower than fossil fuel alternatives such as kerosene. Users also get up to eight hours a day of energy. It would take 18 months to pay for the Azuri unit, bringing the total cost to around $108. Compare this to the $3,000 price tag of the Powerwall pack. But Tesla’s storage solution could help accelerate Africa’s permanent transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, thus aiding the continent’s fight against environmentally destructive greenhouse gas emissions. At least 40% of the African communities that use solar energy still rely on fossil fuel energy sources as a backup. Existing small-scale solar battery devices can’t compete with Tesla’s Powerwall battery, which can supply 1,000 watts for at least 10 hours and possibly more. The impact on everyday life, from tasks such as cooking to study-lighting for school children in urban, semi-urban and rural Africa, could be monumental. Already, Africa’s off-grid communities that have moved from wood-burning to solar power lanterns have enjoyed health and economic benefits. The average urban African household only needs six hours of energy a day to run productively – rural households require much less. Since the Powerwall can offer more than 24 hours of uninterrupted power supply there may be ways to deliver the Tesla solution in a corporate pool to rural communities, rather than to individual households, for whom costs would be prohibitive. Shared utilities such as water, light, and heat still form part of the cultural fabric of many African communities. In order to do this, however, the policy environment for renewable energy – particularly solar and wind – needs to be favourable. Even if Tesla plans to introduce a grant element or cheaper version of the Powerwall battery pack to off-grid African markets, a communal platform for Tesla batteries in Africa may still require a government subsidy scheme. But subsidies could undermine the move towards cleaner energy sources on the continent, and place a huge economic burden on countries. Global experts are awed by the low costs of Tesla’s Powerwall batteries, since competing technologies cost twice as much. The introduction of the technology has clearly reinforced the merits of energy storage systems and could create momentum for the development of cheaper sustainable energy solutions for Africa’s low-income off-grid communities. Tesla is already designing a battery pack for large utility companies in the US, suggesting the possibility of tailored options for specific markets. Africa is grappling with the challenge of transitioning to clean energy systems such as solar. That transition would be smoother if countries’ grid-reliant communities – and not just off-grid ones – formed a core constituency for solar technology. While Africa’s rural poor are often viewed as the main protagonists in the energy access and energy-poverty discourse, the continent’s middle, and largely urban class, are probably the most crucial link in cementing the shift to green energy. It will be primarily this middle-class demographic than can afford the type of solar technology that will force this shift. In the short-term, at least, this demographic could also be the most viable target market in Africa for Tesla’s ground-breaking energy storage.

As pounding bass-filled music booms out of the PA, a great mass of the young, the middle-aged and the old are all glazed with submission as they appear to seek the meaning of the universe in the transformative process of ultraviolet radiation. A few yards away in a darkened auditorium beneath a strange mock pinkish pyramid the Starmus festival is under way. Dedicated to celebrating a synthesis between astronomy and music that is of a more transcendent kind than that practised around the Mediterranean Palace pool, it has drawn hundreds of people focused on very different but no less familiar stars: Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins, Brian May and, the greatest scientific supernova of them all, Stephen Hawking. These, along with 11 Nobel laureates, are some of the leading speakers at the third Starmus festival at the Pirámide de Arona, an island of vaulting intellectual aspiration surrounded by tourist hotels with armies of sunbathers fastened to their poolside loungers as if by superglue. Starmus is an unusual affair, but not necessarily for its setting. It’s not a typical science conference for academics at which new papers are presented. Nor is it a typical public talk designed to popularise established academic theories. Instead it’s a sort of hybrid – at once specialist and popularising, openly public, and yet sufficiently off-circuit to feel discreetly private. It also seeks to bridge the separate worlds of science and the arts or, more specifically, music and cosmology. The brainchild of a bearded Armenian astrophysicist, Garik Israelian, Starmus was first held in 2011. Israelian’s original idea was to do a concert at La Palma observatory, which features the world’s largest optical and infrared telescope. A disarming 53-year-old with a scattershot charm, Israelian had been working at Nasa “trying to get acoustic sound waves in stellar atmospheres” and wondered if musicians might be able to use his collection. He approached Jean-Michel Jarre, who was keen on the idea, only for the concert to be cancelled when the Canary Islands government withdrew funding. Undeterred, Israelian decided to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s first space flight with a festival in 2011. That was the first Starmus. In one sense it was a tremendous success because the keynote speaker was Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon and someone whose public appearances were so rare as to raise suspicion of their authenticity. “When we announced Neil Armstrong was coming,” Israelian recalls, “we completely lost our credibility because no one believed he was going to be there. People said we were crazy. It was the worst thing we could do. And then he came!” Armstrong’s fellow crew member Buzz Aldrin was also there, as well as Jim Lovell, commander of the ill-fated Apollo 13 who was played by Tom Hanks in the eponymous film. In addition there was the progressive electronic band Tangerine Dream. However, in financial terms it was a disaster. Admission was free for most visitors, there was no sponsorship, and Israelian and his co-producers were left to pick up a hefty bill. But that didn’t stop them holding a second Starmus, again on Tenerife. This time Stephen Hawking came. He was a massive draw, but once again the festival lost money. Israelian talks darkly of broken promises by the Canary Islands government and the disappointing lack of sponsorship. They say that one definition of madness is to keep doing the same thing and to expect different results. If so, then Israelian is mad in the best tradition of mad professors, because he came back for a third time with a cast list that was starrier than ever. Not until you’ve seen Brian Cox at a gathering of science buffs can you appreciate how much the awe-filled physicist and TV personality is adored by his public. To walk alongside him though the Pirámide de Arona is to be submerged by a sea of autograph hunters and selfie-takers. Unlike Dawkins, who looks as if he can’t wait to get to the green room, Cox seems to relish the attention. What did he think of his first Starmus? “It’s brilliant,” he says, tucking into an ice-cream. “There’s a lot of time to talk to the speakers. And you don’t normally get people like Brian Eno, Brian May and Hans Zimmer in the same room as Stephen Hawking and Joe Stiglitz.” We talk about Eno’s lecture in which he discussed the intimate relationship between science and art, one the legendary music producer and former Roxy Music synthesiser player characterised as “science discovers and art digests”. “He’s right,” says Cox. “If you look at the history of astronomy, these ideas of finding our place in the universe have had a massive social impact. The obvious one is the relegation of the Earth from the centre of it. That battle to define whether or not we’re special was one of the defining battles of the 17th century onward. Our physical demotion is now widely accepted, but what of the emotional impact if you start talking as Brian Greene and Martin Rees [two other speakers] did about the multiverse. What does it mean if there are an infinite number of these pocket universes? If that’s the case, we’re not geographically significant. We’re not even lucky. We’re just inevitable. Does that matter?” Good question, but I’m not sure that I’ve fully mastered the concept of an infinite number of pocket universes, so I silently nod with as much sagacity as I can muster. “The fact that we’re in an insignificant physical speck in a possibly infinite universe,” he continues, “is as easy or difficult to accept as that we are a very tiny temporal speck in a possibly infinite time span. We know how to deal with that, with death and a finite life time. There is an interesting parallel to be drawn. But it’s a conversation that won’t be had by physicists. It’s a conversation that’s best had in art, philosophy, literature and theology. That’s where the meaning of the things we discover about the universe is teased out.” Back in the darkened auditorium with its decorative scattering of fairy lights – to suggest the stellar illuminations of the cosmos? – Hawking is wheeled on stage. Hawking, as Cox says, is “iconic”, but as the presenter of Forces of Nature also noted, his extraordinary image, the great brain trapped inside the paralysed body, has tended to overshadow his achievements, at least in the mind of the general public. “He’s up there with the best,” says Cox. “Several of the things we take for granted – black holes, Big Bang, singularity – those are his contributions.” Like everyone, Hawking pre-writes his speech – entitled A Brief History of Mine – in his case by selecting the appropriate letters on his computer by moving a keyboard sensor with his cheek. But unlike everyone else, he records the speech, which is then issued one sentence at a time by another movement of his cheek. The speech is a bit like an audio version of the film The Theory of Everything, with a gallop through Hawking’s life story plus key moments of scientific breakthroughs. Interestingly, he estimates that as a lazy Oxford undergraduate, he worked for 1,000 hours in his three years – so much for Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour theory as the basis for genius. Several times there are long pauses, and a cosmic silence pervades the auditorium, until an assistant comes on stage to reboot Hawking’s computer. At the end of a funny, moving and profound speech there is a standing ovation. A little while later there is a comedy musical tribute to Hawking by the American musician and web developer Ken Lawrence, who goes by the stage name of MC Hawking. He performs rap and hip-hop employing gangsta-style slang mixed in with the esteemed scientist’s quotes. It’s sort of clever, even impressive in a way, but painfully unfunny, though that doesn’t stop people laughing. Among the most conspicuously entertained during a chorus of “Black hole yo!” is the Queen guitarist and doctoral astrophysicist Brian May, sitting in the front row. With his long frizz of white hair, May looks how Isaac Newton might have looked if he’d had the opportunity to ram his wet fingers into an electric plug socket. “That was what Starmus is all about,” says Cox afterwards. The session closes with an inspirational talk by the astronaut Chris Hadfield, who had a big hit on YouTube with his rendition of David Bowie’s Space Oddity, recorded during his five-month spell up in the International Space Station. He argues that peopled space travel is a vital part of humanity’s fundamental desire to explore. Before that, though, there’s a discussion between Dawkins and the astrophysicist Steven Balbus about life on other planets. If it exists, says Dawkins, he believes that it’s governed by the laws of evolution. Dawkins has appeared at every Starmus, but he doesn’t look any more comfortable for the experience. Perhaps it’s because – I’m told – he’s staying at the Mediterranean Palace. That thumping bass could get to the most relaxed of people, and not even his most devoted fans would describe him as relaxed. The following day there is a round-table event at the observatory in La Palma. It lasts 108 minutes – the time taken for Gagarin’s first trip into space – and features eight great minds discussing various aspects of space exploration, global issues such as climate change and public communication. Seven of them are men – all white and middle aged or older – and one is a woman. Of the 39 speakers listed for the whole week, only four are women. There are more men called Brian – five of them. And there is one solitary non-white face (the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson). I asked Israelian if the lack of diversity was an issue for him. “No, no. I don’t think about such things,” he says, irritated by the question. “I invited many female scientists and they couldn’t come. I’ve got limited time – I cannot keep inviting people to get 50%. That’s not my problem.” The round table debate turns out to be quite dull, with everyone speaking in optimistic platitudes or pessimistic generalities. It’s not a forum for deep expertise but strong opinion and it turns out that in a group debate the sum is less than its parts. The debate is streamed live on the internet and also into the auditorium beneath the pyramid in Tenerife, which is about half full. As the crowd files out I take a good look at them. They’re much younger on average than the speakers and, in terms of gender at least, much more representative of the outside world. I speak to a 40-year-old physics student called Raquel Rodriguez. If you were looking for a stereotype of an astro-nerd, then Rodriguez is not where you’d start. She looks like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct and tells me her favourite area of discussion is “dark matter and quantum physics”. Then there’s a 32-year-old Norwegian nurse called Guro Nygård. Her brother brought her here for the week as a birthday present. She’s fascinated by astronomy, she says, though this is the first time she’s been to such an event. Her personal highlight from the week was seeing Hawking. “He’s unbelievable,” she says. “His personal history is truly amazing.” Both women noticed the imbalance between men and women but both believed the key thing was to get the best people and that gender, in the short term, was a secondary issue. I find 36-year-old Sam Alexandroni talking to a neuroscientist, a brain surgeon and a rocket scientist. He used to be a journalist at the New Statesman, he says, but now he’s writing a novel. “My teachers did a miserable job at school of communicating the wonder of science. Having discovered it later in life, events like this are brilliant for communicating ideas,” he says. As for combining the sciences and the arts, Alexandroni is all for it, though he says he’s “yet to experience the synergy” at Starmus. The much-anticipated synergy is due to occur the following day at the closing Sonic Universe concert, featuring the woman who lost her heart to a starship trooper, Sarah Brightman, along with the Tenerife Symphony Orchestra, Chris Hadfield and Rick Wakeman doing some Bowie, Hans Zimmer the Hollywood composer, and guest artist Brian May. But sadly I won’t be there. It’s time to pick up my things from the Mediterranean Palace and take to the skies back to London. As I leave, the prostate worshippers of solar energy are still pursuing melanogenesis to the accompaniment of a bludgeoning Eurobeat. Science never stops. And nor, alas, does the music. Chris Hadfield Q&amp;A Chris Hadfield, 56, is a retired Canadian astronaut who served as commander of the International Space Station and became a viral sensation on the internet with his rendition of David Bowie’s Space Oddity. Did you ever get to have any communication with David Bowie? Yeah, I did. I never met him in person. I wish I had, but in order to do what we did, of course we needed his blessing and he was gracious enough to give us very heavily the thumbs-up. He loved the result and said it was the most poignant version ever. Everything I did with him he just came across as a thoughtful, funny, original gentleman of a guy. How did you come to Starmus? I got to know Brian May. I forget how. I think we were conversing from space actually. Then I spent some time with him in Australia and we just hit it off. So I think it was initially Brian who sent a note to me saying, “Hey, this is going on. You should come if you can.” How has being in space change you as a person? Really, it did two things. It gave me a different perspective, and it gave me a level of public voice that I didn’t have before. So then the eternal question is, what do you do with what you are? Do I sell soap or do I buy a yacht? I mean I can’t afford to buy a yacht, but I’m just saying, what do I decide to do with fame? For me, the internal change that came from space flight clarified an understanding of what the world truly is. I think somewhere in my 2,600 orbits, you start to get a completely unfettered understanding of the world. You start to understand what four and a half billion years means. There’s also the commonality of the human experience. If you come to Tenerife you’ll kind of focus on the differences – how is this place different than where I am, or where I grew up, or they’re stupid here because it’s different to the way I do it. But if you go over Tenerife, and a few seconds later over the Cape Verde, and then you cross Africa and then you cross Madagascar, then you come across Perth and then you’re coming around to Sydney and that happens over and over and over again – it’s the similarities of the human experience that predominate. And therefore, obviously pretty quickly, the shared nature of life and the fact that our objectives, no matter what political or religious system we were raised with, have a lot more in common than they do apart. Did you ever find that overwhelming? I mean, how do you not crack up with the weight of that perspective? The people who have had epiphanies of various sorts or have cracked up, almost all of them were in the previous generation of space explorers. Because at that time we threw people into space with a purely technical purpose and almost no human preparation. This was the cold war and we gotta win it, so details be damned. So guys came back from the moon, and some of the cosmonauts... some of them came back alcoholic, depressed or with a religious epiphany. And no one ever treated them the same again. Neil came back a recluse because that was the only way he could deal with it; Buzz came back an alcoholic, but he turned that around. I don’t know anyone in the latter-day era who has had an epiphany. I think it’s spiritual and immensely contemplative, but we prepare for it psychologically. We have a whole team of support people and psychiatrists. They put the guitar on the space station, and a movie library. They build us psychological support equipment. You’re a believer in a peopled mission to Mars. Well, it’s not a belief system. That misrepresents the fundamental question which is: should human exploration stop? That’s a ridiculous expectation because human exploration is innate. We learn to walk way before we learn to talk. You have to be able to explore in order to develop as a human being. A little toddler making odd decisions that are enabled by mobility is how we discovered everything. It took a long time to be able to see what’s over the ocean or even across the Red Sea. It took even longer to cross the Tasman Strait, or all the way down to Antarctica, and even longer to fly – and then even longer to fly above the atmosphere. But it’s all the same. There is nothing magic about space exploration. Space is just an adjective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2015/feb/04/google-data-farm-john-gerrard-internet-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-04T18:09:30Z","webTitle":"Where the internet lives: the artist who snooped on Google’s data farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/04/google-data-farm-john-gerrard-internet-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/04/google-data-farm-john-gerrard-internet-art","fields":{"headline":"Where the internet lives: the artist who snooped on Google’s data farm","bodyText":"Well, they started it. Google Street View allows people to crawl virtually along your street and look at your house. Google Earth offers global intrusion from above. The web giant has done its bit to abolish privacy. Now an artist has out-Googled Google, offering a sneak peek at its less than beautiful underbelly. The joy of the internet is that it is always moving. We experience it as speed, mobility, freedom, flux – as an ethereal superhighway we visualise, if we do at all, as lines of light or pulses of pure energy. Irish digital artist John Gerrard brings this myth crashing down to earth in his new projected installation Farm. A camera very slowly pans around a vaguely sinister industrial complex in the middle of nowhere – well, Oklahoma. Cooling towers, pipes, blank walls, and a lonely basketball court are revealed in the silence and cruel sunlight. This is one of Google’s eight vast data farms where your emails and searches are sorted and remembered. The information superhighway ends here. The internet, says Gerrard, “doesn’t not exist. It is physical. There is a great cable running under the Atlantic ocean from Ireland to America. There’s a new set of infrastructures which are great information railways being put into place. I became interested in asking: what does the internet look like?” Google did not want his answer to that question to be seen. When he enquired about picturing the outside of its Oklahoma “farm” the answer was polite but firm. “I wrote to Google and asked them if I could make a portrait of this place. They said, ‘There is no way that is going to happen.’” Like artists from Giorgio de Chirico to Hilla and Bernd Becher, Gerrard is fascinated by industrial architecture and its place in the landscape. In his show at Thomas Dane Gallery in London he also shows a dizzying satellite perspective on a vast solar energy array and a very Marcel Duchamp-like image of an oil pump penetrating the earth. He first became interested in Google’s data farm after looking at pig farming in Oklahoma. The Google complex reminded him of a pork production plant. Google does allow seductive images of the whizz-bang interiors of its data centres to circulate – all flashing lights and sci-fi wonder. “It’s quite fantastical inside,” says Gerrard. “I think we’ve had quite enough of that – the allure of technology.” The dreary exterior was off limits, however. Gerrard did not give up. He asked the Oklahoma police what the legal situation really was and if Google could actually stop him “portraying” their plant. “The police said, ‘All we can say is, the air is free.’ So we hired a helicopter.” The first time you look at his Google art work, you are captivated by the slow, steady camera sweep that takes in detail after detail of the motionless building as it moves in an unblinking and shake-free 360-degree orbit. Then you realise: this is not real. The camera is “a virtual camera”, explains the artist. “It has an absolutely seamless drift.” The image he has created is a hyperrealistic virtual portrait. It is a digital sculpture mapped out in three dimensions and shown in real time, so the sun moves across the sky and shadows change on the digital landscape at exactly the same time they do on the real data farm in Oklahoma. Gerrard’s unflattering image of our technological world is itself a miracle of technology. His helicopter took 2,500 photographs, which were sent to his workshop in Vienna. “We spent a year hand-building a digital model of the building in Vienna. We’re not filming anything. We are representing reality within this medium.” The simulation he has created of Google’s anonymous industrial “farm” is powered by a game engine that generates and erases images second by second. “We purchased a game engine which is designed for massive military simulations.” Eerily beautiful and intellectually disconcerting, this is a virtual representation of a real, solid place that holds and exchanges virtual information. Gerrard’s monumental projection is a new kind of art. It is also an old kind of art – he calls his works “portraits” and was delighted with the simple pleasure passersby took in his solar energy plant when it was shown on a giant screen outside Lincoln Center in New York last year. He also loved peoples’ surprise when they realised it was a digital simulation. Digital art is obviously going to be a big part of the cultural future, but only a very few artists have so far done anything very impressive with it. John Gerrard is one. The reason his art can answer Google on its own terms and seriously address the strangeness of the new world we are making is, of course, that he actually understands computers and works at the digital cutting edge instead of just messing about with “GIF art” or other stuff that is parasitic on the surface of the internet. Only if you understand the digital from the inside can you make art that examines the structure of our time. Farm inspects Google with the coolness of a 17th-century scientist looking at a bug through a microscope. Yet if there is an obvious biographical connection between Gerrard and his surveys of pig and data farms it is their rural setting. He grew up not in Silicon Valley but on “a small farm” in Tipperary. He comes from a village called Coolbawn, which sounds like it could be the title of a poem by Seamus Heaney. All his adult life, Gerrard has been interested in technology. “I felt even when I was 20 that the computer was the most important artistic medium of the time. Artists always respond to their times. Take the great bourgeois explosion of the 19th century that the impressionists responded to.” Farm is a stately and hypnotic portrait of our time that gradually becomes more disturbing and melancholic as you watch. It is as if the internet has congealed into metal and concrete, our delusions of technological liberation brought, literally, to earth. For Gerrard, all our beautiful gadgets create a “distractive dynamic”. But distraction from what? “Maybe it distracts us from just how dilapidated the natural world is becoming.” I look up from my screen. I get ready to send this story. To you ... Via the farm. A farm, suggests Gerrard, “which is eating us as we eat it”. • John Gerrard: Farm is at Thomas Dane Gallery, London, from 7 February to 21 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/apr/13/divestment-colleges-universities-finance-fossil-fuels-investments","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-13T18:18:01Z","webTitle":"Life after divestment: how to spend the money saved from fossil fuel investments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/13/divestment-colleges-universities-finance-fossil-fuels-investments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/13/divestment-colleges-universities-finance-fossil-fuels-investments","fields":{"headline":"Life after divestment: how to spend the money saved from fossil fuel investments","bodyText":"It began in 2012 with Unity College in Maine. Then Stanford joined in, followed by Syracuse. Now, more than 20 US colleges have divested from fossil fuel companies. A month ago, Swarthmore students stepped up pressure for their administration to divest by occupying a campus building, a move mirrored by students at University of Mary Washington, Harvard and Yale. Why? As the divestment advocate Go Fossil Fuel Free puts it: “If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.” But once an institution has divested, the question arises: what to do with the money? When the Rockefellers, The Gates Foundation, Warren Buffett and George Soros all sold Exxon, you know they didn’t just put the proceeds under the mattress. Whether they ultimately divest or not, colleges have a great option: they can invest in themselves. Last year, Swarthmore’s board of managers rejected divestment, for example, but committed millions of dollars to enhancing energy efficiency at the college. Option 1: invest in energy efficiency This January, Swarthmore asked a group of experts – including myself; environmental educator David Orr; former JP Morgan managing director John Fullerton; Nikki Silvestri, executive director at nonprofit Green for All; and green building experts Bill Browning, Kevin Hydes and Greg Kats – to help the college figure out the best way to move forward. We advised it on which boilers to use, ways to embed sustainability into its curriculum, better investment strategies, and how to engage with underserved members of the local community. One campus publication asserted that the college was nearing the limit of energy efficiency. We disabused college officials of that notion. One building on campus had leaded glass windows. Beautiful, but leaky, single panes squandered the heat rising from the registers immediately below them. Many campus buildings had enough little cracks around their windows to amount to leaving a window open all year long. One potential solution comes from companies like Aether, which will now come to a university or corporate campus and implement comprehensive efficiency measures at no cost to the institution, taking their pay by splitting the savings that result. Numerous studies have found that green buildings can deliver better productivity, higher student performance and guaranteed returns. Swarthmore’s commitment to improving its efficiency is smart business, and will likely earn enough returns to pay several faculty salaries, garnering a far more secure return than a stock portfolio. The US Green Building Council reports that owners of existing buildings enjoyed a 19.2% return on investment for efficiency improvements. One conservative report calculated that investing $400,000 on efficiency in a 100,000 square-foot building would deliver $1.50 per square foot in reduced energy costs over a similar building without the efficiency. That $150,000 per year savings would pay back the extra costs in little over two and a half years. Thereafter, the savings stay with the college. The University of Hawaii at Manoa spends $24.5m each year on energy. Facing a $34m shortfall in 2016 and 2017 from rising energy costs, it plans to spend $66m on energy efficiency and renewable generation projects. Its projected return will be $7.7m per year, doubling the $3.4m it saved in 2014 from the efficiency measures it has already put in place. These are big numbers, but research by Gregory Kats, president of clean energy consultant and venture capital firm Capital-E, found a 3.3% increase in occupant productivity after energy efficiency improvements that also boost indoor air quality; 5.5% from efficiency that improves temperature control; and 3.2% from the installation of high-performance lighting systems. Given that worker salaries cost roughly 100 times the energy bill, this makes efficiency worthwhile even if you don’t care about saving on your utility bill or the impact on the climate. Option 2: invest in renewables Years ago, Swarthmore students began raising money so the college could buy wind power. By 2007, the school was 40% powered by wind. But the administration has preferred to buy renewable energy credits to offset the school’s use of fossil fuels, which is noble but costly. Such offsets pay to build renewable energy somewhere on the planet, but not necessarily near campus. Meanwhile, companies like Sun Edison will, for no money down, install solar at a school or business, charging a monthly fee that’s usually less than the amount the customer was previously paying in utility bills. A school such as Swarthmore, with an almost $2bn endowment, could also just buy its own system. Butte College became the first “grid positive” campus, generating more than 100% of the energy it needs after investing $27.3m in solar energy on campus roofs, walkways and parking lots. That may sound like a lot, but the college expects to save between $50m and $75m over the next 15 years by eliminating its electricity bill, getting paid for excess electricity production, and avoiding future electricity rate increases. It hopes to use the savings to improve student offerings and increase enrollment. Investments in renewables grew 12% globally last year, according to a report released in January by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Globally, 2014 was the year of the renewable energy installation juggernaut,” said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance at the institute. “With the notable exception of Australia, where policy uncertainty served as an effective hand-brake, wherever you look around the globe, be it China, India, Europe or the US, the trend of a rapidly-expanding renewable energy industry is the same. 2015 will inevitably see this gather pace.” A study by Cambridge and PricewaterhouseCoopers, conducted for the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, found that solar energy is on track to achieve grid parity in 80% of countries within next two years. It’s time to divest Students with Swarthmore Mountain Justice appreciate the school’s interest in good housekeeping, but are continuing their sit-in at the administration’s building. I agree that divestment is a good idea. As I told Swarthmore administration members attending a workshop: “Even if you create savings with infrastructure investments, your portfolio will remain at risk as long as it continues to invest in fossil fuels. We’re watching you. You think your fossil-laden portfolios are a good investment. When that becomes clear that they are not, you will have to explain your lapse of fiduciary responsibility.” Pax World Management, a socially responsible fund, argues against the belief that fossil investments are necessary to underwrite education, saying that: “Several studies over the past three years, since the beginning of the Divest Fossil Fuel campaign, that have found that fossil fuel-free or low-carbon portfolios either outperformed or performed similarly to benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis.” FTSE’s North American fossil fuel-free index has consistently outperformed the conventional benchmark index. In an analysis earlier this month, stock market index company MSCI found that fossil-free funds have earned a higher return than conventional ones in the last five years. Conversely, coal stocks are an increasingly risky investment. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that coal stocks have lost 50-90% of their value since 2005. Peabody, one of the worlds biggest coal companies, lost $787m in 2014, and its shares plunged 84% in five years. Oil has done little better. A Financial Times article from 2013 described the performance of international oil and gas companies as “lamentable from a shareholder perspective” over the last decade. Since June 2014, big oil has lost $200bn. There’s no question finance is a potent force. College divestment from South African companies, after all, played a role in ending apartheid. (Swarthmore divested in 1990, decades after students began calling for divestment in 1965.) In 1990, on Nelson Mandela’s first trip to the US after being released from prison, he spoke at the Oakland Coliseum, acknowledging the Campaign Against Apartheid – one of the leading campus divestment organizations – and thanking the American students who had held firm in the divestment campaign. As John Fullerton puts it, how money is invested – whether by companies, by colleges or by you – influences whether we trash the planet or save it. His description of the risk of carbon bubbles and stranded assets sets forth fundamentals that should guide investors in the age of climate crisis. The activism has only begun. Divestment does matter. Oxford’s Stranded Assets Programme report concluded that “divestment outflows, even when relatively meagre in the first wave of divestment, can significantly and permanently depress stock price of a target firm if they trigger a change in market norms”. Peabody Coal, in its 27 January filing with the SEC, warned: “Divestment could significantly affect demand for our product.” This comes on the tail of an International Energy Agency report which found that the world’s efforts to limit carbon emissions is working. For the first time in 40 years, global carbon emissions from the energy sector stalled and began to decline. We can save the planet from the scourge of climate chaos, but only if we act.

Located at the heart of King’s Cross, Europe’s largest regeneration project, 5 Pancras Square is one of the first buildings of its kind to be honoured with an “outstanding” rating by world-leading assessment body BREEAM. Officially unveiled in July 2014, the £123m development combines four levels of offices with public entrance, two swimming pools, a library, café and gym with ten floors of council offices. This integration is helping to reduce the council’s environmental footprint, foster improved ways of working among employees and better serve the local community. 5 Pancras Square is one of the main projects of Camden council’s “green action for change” strategy. The council aims to achieve a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020 and an 80% reduction by 2050. In partnership with Bennetts Associates Architects and a developer, Argent, the council stuck closely to the tenets of its environmental policy when designing the new building and sold £130m of council property to fund the project. The council adopted simple, robust design techniques that maximised the use of renewable energy, reduced energy use and optimised comfort. The building is highly insulated, well ventilated and captures solar energy through roof-mounted solar panels. Natural light is maximised, while motion-sensitive LED lights are fitted throughout the building to save energy. Under-floor ventilation recovers heat from the leisure centre and the building is also connected to King’s Cross’s combined heat and power system, further reducing CO2 emissions. The building features a modular chiller system – the first of its kind in the UK – to help maintain energy efficiency as the seasons change. A green roof helps to control storm water run-off and prevent localised flooding. All taps, showers and toilets have also been fitted with water-saving measures. Camden council and its partners rigorously assessed the environmental and ethical credentials of construction materials and techniques, sourcing 90% of materials from sustainable sources. BREAAM gave 5 Pancras Square a score of 93.05% for its design, and the project appears to be on track for a record-breaking post-completion score of 97.12%. The building has also attained a non-domestic energy performance certificate “A” rating. By moving 76% of the council’s office staff to the new building, the council has shrunk its office carbon footprint by an estimated 64% and will generate energy efficiency cost savings of approximately £500,000 a year. Within a few months of opening the building, it had achieved a 46% reduction in the number of vehicles making deliveries to council buildings, particularly 5 Pancras Square. With the majority of the council’s employees under one roof, Camden has taken the opportunity to create an improved working culture. The building’s diverse, modern work spaces are intended to foster improved communication and collaboration. Meanwhile, a transition from desktop computers to laptops with instant messaging, and a new digital filing system, are helping to further reduce carbon emissions. Employees can cycle to work, with cycle racks for 20% of staff nearby and Kings Cross is a public transport hub. Around 3,000 employees made the move in just eight weeks. Camden consulted local residents and community groups about new services and leisure facilities. This resulted in a swimming pool with a movable floor that can be turned into a community space, and gym equipment designed for those with impaired mobility. The leisure centre has so far attracted more than 4,000 members and 100,000 visits. The highly visible customer service centre, which provides information about council services, is receiving 1,500 customers a week. The Guardian judges considered 5 Pancras Square to be an example of Camden council “putting its money where its mouth is”, and recognised Bennetts Associates Architects as an “unsung hero” for its efforts to help clients push the boundaries of sustainability. Bennetts took the design of 5 Pancras Square as far as possible, the judges agreed. Bennetts Associates Architects is the 2015 winner of the impact award in the built environment category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/21/are-solar-farms-really-hitting-british-food-production","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-21T10:24:22Z","webTitle":"Are solar farms really hitting British food production?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/21/are-solar-farms-really-hitting-british-food-production","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/21/are-solar-farms-really-hitting-british-food-production","fields":{"headline":"Are solar farms really hitting British food production?","bodyText":"The environment secretary, Liz Truss, has stripped farmers of subsidies for solar farms, saying they are a “blight” that was pushing food production overseas. But the new minister has fundamentally misunderstood the way solar farms operate, according to the solar industry and farmers. Truss revealed on Monday new rules on payments under the Common Agriculture Policy that will see agricultural subsidies removed from solar farms. She said: “I am committed to food production in this country and it makes my heart sink to see row upon row of solar panels where once there was a field of wheat or grassland for livestock to graze.” Truss told the Mail on Sunday that 10,000 football pitches of panels were “in the pipeline”. She said solar farms were “ugly, a blight on the countryside, and villages are pushing production of meat and other traditional British produce overseas”. But farmers who run solar farms said Truss’s justification for removing the subsidies was flawed. First, almost all solar farms in the UK continue to produce food. Second, solar farms provide farmers with a way to diversify their income – helping them to stay in business. “It seems a shame that people aren’t becoming informed before they make judgments,” said Clive Sage, who has a 4.8MW solar farm on his property in West Dorset and continues to produce prime lamb from beneath the panels. “As times have moved on, as a small family farm, we’ve had to diversify to survive.” He said this government had originally encouraged farmers to diversify their income streams through solar farming. But Truss’s move showed that the government did not understand the issue. “It’s nonsense for anyone to say that you can’t use land for solar production and agricultural production. The sheep compliment the solar really well. For them to pull the rug out, I don’t really think this government understands the word sustainability.” “It definitely helped us to survive,” says Andrew Hawkey of his 5MW solar farm in North Cornwall. Hawkey’s family have been farming his land for four generations. “We are committed farmers, we are Cornish farmers and we want to stay farming.” For the Hawkeys, there was never a choice between farming food and farming sun. His solar fields are also still used to produce lamb. “There is virtually no loss [of production] at all. We could almost say we are farming double on the same land,” he said. Originally the land had seen a rotation between crops and pasture. The only change was that now the land was solely used for sheep grazing. He said the solar panels had offered an unexpected benefit as they provided shelter for animals during the winter months. Farmer Edward Packe-Drury-Lowe’s property currently houses the largest solar farm in the UK at Wymeswold. The disused airfield was previously used for grazing sheep and cattle and growing oilseed rape. Packe-Drury-Lowe said the sheep remained an essential part of his farm. He said there is anecdotal evidence from some farms that solar can actually provide a boost to the production of lamb because of the shelter provided by the panels. He says stopping crops that use pesticides also had an immediate effect. “If you look at the biodiversity, the bees, insect life, the gain is almost instant.” This boost has a knock-on benefit to all farmers in the area. Former energy secretary, Chris Huhne, told Newsnight on Monday that Truss’s prioritisation of food production over energy made little sense. “We import our energy and we import our food, so frankly, saying that we should make less energy so that we don’t have to import apples seems to me to be nuts.” Whether a net loss of food production occurs depends largely on what was being farmed before. This is governed by the government’s planning guidance, which already stipulates that land for solar farms should preference “previously developed land, and if a proposal does involve greenfield land, that it allows for continued agricultural use and/or encourages biodiversity improvements around arrays”. Communities minister Kris Hopkins said planning provisions were already in place to ensure productive farmland remained unadulterated. “The guidance is clear that councils must protect good-quality farmland and consider the effective use of brownfield land.” The solar trade association’s advice goes further, recommending highly productive crop land be avoided and only land graded 3b, 4 or 5 be developed for solar farms. It appears that some farms, including Hawkey’s which was built before the guidance came in around 18 months ago, have been placed on higher grade agricultural land. But the Solar Trade Association (STA) says this no longer happens at any of the projects they manage. Solar farms do limit what can be grown on the land. In some cases, sheep alone have replaced a rotation of sheep, cattle and crops. But it is unclear whether this reduces the overall productivity of low grade land. Conversely, there are examples, such as the 14 MW solar array at Marsh Farm, where a solar farm on previously unused land is now running livestock for the first time. The solar industry, whose farms were consistently attacked by the Consevative MP and former climate minister Greg Barker, were incensed by another Tory minister coming out in opposition to solar farms. Leonie Greene, from the STA, said Truss’s comments were “damaging and incorrect”. Greene said: “The land is still available for farming – the solar fixings only take up 5% of the land. This means plenty of room for continued agricultural practices such as sheep, geese or chicken farming. As far as farm payments are concerned, solar should really be treated in the same way as orchards or fields with trees, where animals continue to graze the land in between.” Toddington Harper, from solar operators Belectric, said: “I think [Truss] has completely misunderstood the benefits. She’s said we are taking land out of food production, which we are not. What else would you expect from a [former] oil executive?” Harper said all 10 of Belectric’s solar farms are still farmed for food and that the planning advice simply needed to be enforced. “She should be saying that every solar farm must continue agricultural use. It’s happening most of the time but if it happens all of the time time that would be marvellous.” London Greens councillor Jenny Jones said Truss’s suggestion to the Mail on Sunday that orchards were being replaced by solar farms was “total nonsense”. Jones said: “This misguided attack by the environmentsecretary deliberately ignores the fact that the planning system is already there to prevent unsightly and overly dominant solar farms or their deployment on high-quality productive agricultural land. Where they do go ahead on poorer grade soils, planning conditions should ensure that they boost biodiversity and revert back to their original use when appropriate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/mar/18/tesla-new-jersey-direct-sale-law","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-18T21:41:12Z","webTitle":"Tesla 'open for business' in New Jersey again as law enables direct sale to public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/18/tesla-new-jersey-direct-sale-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/mar/18/tesla-new-jersey-direct-sale-law","fields":{"headline":"Tesla 'open for business' in New Jersey again as law enables direct sale to public","bodyText":"Electric cars may now be sold in outlets in New Jersey again, following a year in legal limbo, after state governor Chris Christie signed a law on Wednesday that will allow the zero-emissions luxury cars made by Tesla Motors to go on sale there. “We heard about a minute ago on Twitter, we are pretty excited,” a salesman at one of the two Tesla branches in the state told the Guardian, while declining to be named, saying only staff at the manufacturer’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, are allowed to comment officially. “We are proud to tell New Jersey that we are open for business,” said Diarmuid O’Connell, vice-president of corporate business development for Tesla Motors. If there is an immediate rush from the public, Tesla might find itself challenged as the sales room in question had only two cars in stock – having not been allowed to sell any to the public for almost 12 months. Christie signed into law a bill passed by the state senate just two days ago that allows the company to sell its cars directly to the public without going through traditional dealerships. Under the law, Tesla is permitted to have four outlets in New Jersey. It currently has two, one in Paramus and one in Short Hills. But potential customers have only been able to take a demonstration drive and poke and prod the vehicles in the two showrooms in the state for the past year – not buy them or even discuss the price, which starts at a hefty $69,000, with staff at the site. The hiatus followed a row that entangled Christie, the New Jersey state legislature, the state’s Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC), car dealers, Tesla Motors and, ultimately, the motoring public. A year ago, the MVC blocked sales of Tesla cars from the company’s outlets in New Jersey, claiming the manufacturer would be breaking state law if it bypassed the traditional dealership model to sell directly to the public. Christie said his hands were tied until state lawmakers would sign the relevant legislation. Tesla’s high-profile chief executive, engineering, solar energy and space rocket impresario Elon Musk, blew a gasket. In a statement to “the people of New Jersey”, he accused the auto dealer lobby of cutting “a backroom deal with the governor” to circumvent the legislative process by persuading the MVC, which he said was “composed of political appointees of the governor”, to end the public’s right to buy cars at a manufacturer store within the state. Tesla Motors took to Twitter to accuse the state’s auto dealer community of being “bad for innovation” by supporting a regulation to block the sale of the cars. The New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers fired back in remarks in Newsweek that it was Tesla that was “stifling innovation” with its “petulant” response to the ban. Enough hot air was generated to increase New Jersey’s already relatively poor record on pollution, which Tesla Motors’ products attempt to go some way to addressing. For the past year, consumers in New Jersey have been able to buy a Tesla vehicle there only by ordering online and going through an awkward process for delivery and registration. “I said last year that if the legislature changed the law, I would sign new legislation put on my desk, and that is exactly what I’m doing. We’re pleased that manufacturers like Tesla will now have the opportunity to establish direct sales operations for consumers in a manner lawfully in New Jersey,” Christie said on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-13T14:54:47Z","webTitle":"Wind power is cheapest energy, EU analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds","fields":{"headline":"Wind power is cheapest energy, EU analysis finds","bodyText":"Onshore wind is cheaper than coal, gas or nuclear energy when the costs of ‘external’ factors like air quality, human toxicity and climate change are taken into account, according to an EU analysis. The report says that for every megawatt hour (MW/h) of electricity generated, onshore wind costs roughly €105 (£83) per MW/h, compared to gas and coal which can cost up to around €164 and €233 per MW/h, respectively. Nuclear power, offshore wind and solar energy are all comparably inexpensive generators, at roughly €125 per MW/h. “This report highlights the true cost of Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels,” said Justin Wilkes, the deputy CEO of the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA). “Renewables are regularly denigrated for being too expensive and a drain on the taxpayer. Not only does the commission’s report show the alarming cost of coal but it also presents onshore wind as both cheaper and more environmentally-friendly.” The paper, which was written for the European commission by the Ecofys consultancy, suggests that the Conservative party plan of restricting new onshore windfarms will mean blocking out the cheapest source of energy when environmental and health facts are taken into consideration. It has been suggested the Tory plan could be done through a cap on onshore wind turbines’ output, lower subsidies or tighter planning restrictions. “Any plans to change policy for onshore wind must be looked at in the context of this report,” said Oliver Joy a spokesman for EWEA. “Investors need long-term visibility. ‘Stop-start’ policies as well as harsh retroactive changes can blindside investors, driving up the risk premium and cost of capital.” The documents’ contents may also be unwelcome in some quarters of the commission, which early today published selective results from it that did not include external health and pollution costs. These showed that renewable energy took €38.3bn of public subsidies in 2012, compared to €22.3bn for gas, coal and nuclear. The EU did however note that if free carbon allowances to polluters were included in the data, it “would reduce the gap between support for renewables and other power generation technologies.” The Ecofys paper’s nuanced evaluation of historical subsidies for coal and nuclear was also not mentioned in the EU press release, which renewable energy associations linked to a fossil fuel lobbying effort ahead of the report’s publication. “Despite decades of heavy subsidies, mature coal and nuclear energy technologies are still dependent on similar levels of public support as innovative solar energy is receiving today,” Frauke Thies, the policy director for the European Photovoltaic Industry Association told the Guardian. “The difference is that costs of solar continue to decrease rapidly. If the unaccounted external costs to society are included, the report demonstrates that support to fossil fuels and nuclear even by far exceeds that to solar.” The EU’s energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, said that the report was only “a first step” to filling gaps in knowledge about the nature of energy subsidies and more reports are likely in the months ahead. The figures for the energy sources in the report are all approximate, as the bar chart listing them is counted in units of €25 MW/h. Last year, a row broke out in Brussels after the German newspaper Suddeutche Zeitung reported that Oettinger had tried to delete figures cited in a commission report showing that in 2011, fossil fuels took €26bn in public subsidies, compared to €35bn for nuclear power and €30bn for renewables."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/08/solar-wind-energy-sources-huge-majority-australians-poll-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-08T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Solar and wind energy backed by huge majority of Australians, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/08/solar-wind-energy-sources-huge-majority-australians-poll-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/08/solar-wind-energy-sources-huge-majority-australians-poll-shows","fields":{"headline":"Solar and wind energy backed by huge majority of Australians, poll shows","bodyText":"Solar and wind energy enjoy strong support from the Australian public, with 80% of people putting them both among their top three energy choices in a poll for the Australia Institute. By contrast, coal and coal seam gas were chosen by 35% and 38% of those polled as being among the best three future energy sources. A separate review of medical literature by the Australia Institute debunked the fear that wind power damaged people’s health, finding “no credible evidence” directly linking exposure to turbines with negative health effects. The poll of more than 1,400 people showed that solar was the popular energy choice of the future, cited by 63% of respondents. Nine out of 10 people said they wanted more solar energy. Six in 10 people said they were concerned about the impact of coal and coal seam gas on the landscape. Despite this apparent desire for renewables – as well as the country’s vast capacity for such energy – the Australia Institute report states that Australia now produces “only the world average level” of solar energy. While the production of solar PV panels is relatively energy intensive, the report concedes, solar’s output of greenhouse gases, and its impact on air quality, is completely overshadowed by the burning of coal. Wind has the potential to supply 40% of Australia’s energy needs, the report says, but the industry has been blighted by the “considerable attention” placed on the perceived health effects of wind turbines. The Australia Institute points out that the National Health and Medical Research Council recently conducted a review of the scientific literature on the connection between windfarms and health and found there was “no consistent association between adverse health effects and estimated noise from wind turbines”. The Australia Institute report states: “Perceived high levels of opposition have been linked to a vocal minority, with many surveys suggesting reasonably high levels of support, especially in community-owned wind operations. “Wind turbines do cause bird and bat deaths, however rates are well below deaths from many other causes including climate change, and technological advances are likely to mediate these further.” A Senate inquiry, established by crossbench and Liberal senators, is set to take yet another look at the health impact of windfarms. The construction of wind turbines has virtually ground to a halt nationally due to uncertainty over the renewable energy target. In Victoria they are banned from being put up within 2km of a dwelling without written consent. “There has been fairly consistent support for renewables, which will only increase as people realise what’s about to happen with climate change,” Dr Jeremy Moss, co-author of the reports, told Guardian Australia. “Australia is at a crossroads. Coal is on the way out and we’re choosing between gas, wind and solar. The health implications are fundamental, both direct and indirect,” he said. “Gas contributes to global warming and so that’s the big reason not to do it, given that the World Health Organisation says climate change is killing around 150,000 people a year. That’s a clear indirect impact.” Moss said he rejected the idea that gas and nuclear power, which are both lower in emissions than coal, should be used as a “bridging fuel” until renewables were online. “You don’t build a gas plant for one or two years, you build them for 10 or 20 years so you get a return on them,” he said. “Also, most of our gas is being exported and it’s only better than coal if it’s replacing coal here.” Moss said Tony Abbott was “very out of touch” with public opinion on energy. The prime minister has said coal is “good for humanity” and that he would like to see coal production go “up and up and up”. Moss said: “Australia, despite Tony Abbott’s claims, can’t hold out much longer in doing something meaningful on climate change. We are completely out of step with the rest of the world. “The government needs to acknowledge there is a climate change problem and commit to very deep emissions cuts. From those deep cuts we need to put a heavy focus on how we produce our energy and also look at the kinds of things we export.” International climate change talks are being held in Lima, with the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the trade minister, Andrew Robb, representing Australia. The talks are seen as a crucial precursor to a UN summit held in Paris next year, where countries will look to strike a new deal to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. On Monday the government was accused of trying to set up those talks for failure by insisting any agreement clinched in Paris must include legally binding emissions targets. A separate report released by the Climate Council on Tuesday raised the bushfire season outlook from “above normal” to “major” in Victoria, owing to dry conditions. The organisation estimated the bushfire season would cost the state more than $172m in the coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T04:01:07Z","webTitle":"Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal","bodyText":"A plan to tackle climate change by emulating the race to put a man on the moon is launched on Tuesday, aiming to channel billions of dollars in research that will give renewable energy commercial lift off. The Global Apollo Programme aims to make the cost of clean electricity lower than that from coal-fired power stations across the world within 10 years. It calls for £15bn a year of spending on research, development and demonstration of green energy and energy storage, the same funding in today’s money that the US Apollo programme spent in putting astronauts on the moon. The plan is the brainchild of a group of eminent UK scientists, economists and businessmen including Sir David King, currently the UK’s climate change envoy, Lord Nicholas Stern, Lord Adair Turner and ex-BP chief Lord John Browne. King said green energy already had advantages over fossil fuel power in cutting deadly air pollution and reducing the carbon emissions that drive global warming. But he said making clean energy cheaper was important too: “Once we get to that point, we are winning in all the battles.” King, who has visited 60 countries in his climate diplomacy role, said many countries were interested in the Apollo plan, including the UK, US, Japan, China, Korea, Mexico and the UAE. In particular, King said Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister and solar energy enthusiast, was keen. The plan has been discussed by G7 energy ministers and is on the agenda for the G7 heads of state meeting in Germany on 7 June. King said he hoped the Apollo project would launch in November, just ahead of the crunch UN climate change summit in Paris which nations have set a deadline for a global deal. “Nasa showed how a stupendous goal could be achieved, amazingly fast, if the will and the resources are there,” said Professor Martin Rees, former head of the Royal Society and another member of the Apollo group. The moon landings were spurred by cold war rivalries and Rees said the energy challenge would provide its own motivation: “I find it hard to imagine anything more inspiring for engineers than to provide clean energy for the world.” The Apollo programme aims to double the money being spent globally on research and development of renewable energy, energy storage and smart grids from the current 2% of the world’s R&amp;D budget. Nations joining the programme would commit to spending 0.02% of GDP on the R&amp;D and would get a place on a global commission that would coordinate and direct the research to avoid duplication. A similar, though smaller, commission already exists to coordinate R&amp;D on semiconductors and has resulted in continuous falls in computer chip costs. There would be no central Apollo fund and nations would still control how to spend their own money. The UK already spends 0.02% of its GDP on clean energy, as do some other developed nations, but other countries do not and there is no international cooperation to maximise the results. Lord Richard Layard, an economist at the London School of Economics and member of the Apollo group, said it was barely believable that the world only spent 2% of its R&amp;D money on its “most pressing problem” of climate change and clean energy. He said: “We do not think this problem can be conquered unless we reduce the cost of renewable energy below the cost of dirty energy.” Stern said that electricity from coal-fired power stations only appeared cheaper because the costs of air pollution and climate change were not included. He noted that the IMF recently calculated that fossil fuels benefit from subsidies of $5.3 tn a year, or $10m a minute, half of which derives from the polluters not paying the costs of health damage from air pollution. Improving technologies for energy storage is a particular focus as this tackle to problem of intermittency of renewable energy that relies on the sun to shine or wind to blow. Current levels of renewables can be accommodated on national grids, the Apollo group said. But making electricity 100% renewable by 2050 would require affordable energy storage, both on the domestic scale and national scale. Storage technologies being targeted include better batteries, heat storage in water, soil or molten salt, compressed air, flywheels and hydrogen. Sir David Attenborough, who recently discussed climate change in a meeting with US president Barack Obama, said: “I have been involved in arguments about the despoilation of the natural world for many years. The exciting thing about the [Apollo] report is that it is a positive report – at last someone is saying there is a way we can do things.” Prof John Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and former adviser to German chancellor Angela Merkel called the Apollo plan “truly ingenious” and said it “could well be a tipping point” in tackling climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/22/earth-day-scientists-warning-fossil-fuels-","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-22T06:11:24Z","webTitle":"Earth day: leading scientists say 75% of known fossil fuels must stay underground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/22/earth-day-scientists-warning-fossil-fuels-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/22/earth-day-scientists-warning-fossil-fuels-","fields":{"headline":"Earth Day: scientists say 75% of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in ground","bodyText":"Three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground if humanity is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a group of leading scientists and economists have said in a statement timed to coincide with Earth Day. The Earth League, which includes Nicholas Stern, the author of several influential reports on the economics of climate change; Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and adviser to Angela Merkel; and the US economist Jeffrey Sachs, urged world leaders to follow up on their commitments to avoid dangerous global warming. Spelling out what a global deal at the UN climate summit in Paris later this year should include, the group demanded governments adopt a goal of reducing economies’ carbon emissions to zero by mid-century, put a price on carbon and that the richest take the lead with the most aggressive cuts. In its “Earth statement”, the group said that three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground if warming was not to breach a rise of 2C, the “safety limit” agreed to by governments. Johan Rockström, the statement’s lead author, said: “From a scientific perspective, 2015 is a decisive moment. The window to navigate ourselves free from a ‘beyond 2C future’ is barely open. It’s the last chance to navigate ourselves towards a desired future. “It’s so frustrating, because it’s the choice of moving down a business-as-usual route with devastating outcomes for humanity and, at the same time, we have this almost unprecedented opportunity, we can transform the world economy to a fossil fuel-free one and moreover do it in a way that is security and health-wise more attractive.” The statement says that failure by the world to act on climate change would bring is a one in 10 chance of temperatures rising by more than 6C by 2100, a level of risk that would be comparable with accepting 10,000 plane crashes daily worldwide. Rockström said there was now enough scientific evidence that the world was approaching irreversible tipping points where the Earth’s system begins to accelerate the warming that man has already caused. Methane being released as permafrost thaws and melting ice meaning less solar energy reflected back into space are two examples. “That’s the scientific nightmare,” Rockström said. “You don’t want the Earth to go from friend to foe … this could happen quite soon; we need to bend the curve on emissions over the next 10 to 15 years.” He admitted, however, that there was a significant gap between the group’s demands and what might be achieved at the Paris conference, COP21, with several significant players already playing down expectations. “We’re not at all where we need to be,” Rockström said. Sachs said: “COP21 is the moment of truth, the last chance to stay within the 2C upper limit.” The statement called for developed countries to help scale up financial aid for developing countries to deal with climate change, and for Paris to agree the beginnings of a strategy to make countries more resilient to the extreme weather a warming world is expected to bring. Brian Hoskins, one of the Earth statement signatories and the director of the Grantham institute for climate change at Imperial College London, said that given the importance of the Paris summit, the attention given to climate change in the UK general election campaign was “pathetic” and “extremely disappointing”. “The contrast between the importance of this year and our election is just stark,” he said. “It seems we go towards the lowest common denominator in such a discussion of this, instead of stepping back and saying what do we want, what is our vision for the country, what is our vision for the world, we’re saying, are we going to get a pack of butter for 20p rather than 30p? It’s a shopping list rather than a vision.” This year’s Earth Day was marked by Barack Obama in his weekly video address. He said he would be visiting the Florida Everglades on Wednesday to see how the environment is at risk from rising sea levels there: “Climate change can no longer be denied or ignored,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/feb/22/3d-printing-solar-energy-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-22T12:06:03Z","webTitle":"How 3D printing could revolutionise the solar energy industry | John J Licata","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/feb/22/3d-printing-solar-energy-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/feb/22/3d-printing-solar-energy-industry","fields":{"headline":"How 3D printing could revolutionise the solar energy industry","bodyText":"During President Obama's recent state of the union address, I was particularly drawn to one specific comment he made. The statement by the president I'm referring to was, \"A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionise the way we make almost everything.\" 3D printing has been increasingly used to produce jewellery, dental work, prototyping and even creating human organs. However, as an energy strategist, I'm most excited about the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise solar panel and photovoltaic (PV) cell manufacturing. For starters, for those not familiar with 3D printing, it's the ability to make a three-dimensional \"solid\" object from digital design specifications. In other words, 3D printing is really a smart printer that creates objects layer by layer through additive manufacturing or the deposits of materials such as glass, silicon, plastic, resin and ceramic by following a virtual blueprint or animated software. You may be asking why I'm so positive on its relationship to solar power. Well, that's easy. Right now there is a huge lack of energy storage, which, coupled with known manufacturing inefficiencies, have damaged solar industry sentiment. Therefore future production of solar cells must be more sustainable. This has me intrigued by the potential 3D printing can have on the solar sector. I believe this new printing medium could be a game-changer as 3D solar cells, despite advances in energy storage, can capture more sunlight than conventional PV models. How? They are more precise (using copper, indium, gallium, selenide: CIGS), less complex and weigh less. Greater efficiency in lieu of not having direct sunlight overhead is something I believe is extremely encouraging for 3D solar considering many pessimists who continue to question the longevity of solar power produced in a day by ordinary flat PV cells. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe 3D solar panels could be roughly 20% more efficient than flat solar panels. 3D printing can extend the amount of solar absorbed into cells, which may turn some haters of solar power into believers. Another benefit is cost. While installation is the dominate cost for solar power, it is estimated that precision 3D printing could drop production costs by 50% by eliminating many of the inefficiencies associating with the waste of costly materials such as glass, polysilicon or even indium. The ability to control the material inputs of your finished solar product would further turn traditional manufacturing of PV on its head by creating more of an on-demand model that doesn't require fabrication at distant warehouses. The fact 3D printing can take place just about anywhere should mitigate the lofty shipping costs which also deters positive views toward traditional flat PV. Then there's the lower weight and size. Most people think of solar as a power source for homes and that's fine. However, its my view 3D printing can produce extremely thin solar cells which can be printed on untreated paper, plastic or fabric rather than expensive glass. Therefore the advanced ability to create flexible solar panels at a lighter weight could have bigger positive implications for wearable hi-tech clothing, radios and future electronics. This gives 3D solar more mass appeal I believe. This could even bode well for some rather unique future opportunities for 3D solar in areas such as automotive paint and commercial/residential buildings which may incorporate a thin \"solar spray\", something that is far less of an eyesore than PV panels on the roof. 3D printing looks set to become a hot topic in coming years as the US tries to meet 2020 carbon goals while also further exploring ways to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil. That may ultimately mean 3D printing could turn the solar market on its edge sooner than later. • John J Licata is the chief energy strategist of Blue Phoenix, an independent research and consulting company focused on next generation energy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/06/caribbean-paradise-for-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-06T10:45:52Z","webTitle":"Is the Caribbean a paradise for renewable energy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/06/caribbean-paradise-for-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/06/caribbean-paradise-for-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Is the Caribbean a paradise for renewable energy?","bodyText":"Derek’s one-door shop selling cakes, sweets and soft drinks in Barbados appears at first glance to be just like any other, until you lift your eyes upward. On the roof is an array of solar panels arranged in a less-than textbook design, but the aesthetics don’t matter. What’s important is that it produces usable energy. What motivated Derek to get into solar power? Was it a desire to be green or combat climate change? “Climate change? I don’t even know what that is,” he says. “I just didn’t want to depend on the power company.” Electricity is expensive in Barbados. Derek bought a solar kit including one panel for $100 (£64). Derek is a mechanic by trade and is using his system to charge car batteries. He has found a way to integrate his solar system into his business. This is entrepreneurship in its truest sense. A viable business venture for Derek and a chance for wider environmental benefits for the country are the win-wins, but neither of these was the prime driver for Derek. He was essentially a tinkerer with an idea and wanted to try it out in the hope of paying less for power. If Derek can make it to such a level of self-sufficiency starting from small beginnings, does this mean that individuals and businesses with greater means have gone even further? Well, more Dereks are gradually popping up throughout the Caribbean, but generally the answer is no. The Caribbean appears to be the ideal location for renewable energy development. Petroleum resources are scarce and renewable resources such as solar, wind and geothermal are plentiful. Energy prices are high as there is no opportunity for economy of scale benefits that large land masses enjoy. Added to that, climate change impacts pose a major threat to the region’s small-island economies that are largely dependent on tourism and agriculture. Despite this, most Caribbean nations still use imported diesel or oil to generate 90-100% of their energy. So what has been the barrier to using renewables? Many people have pointed to the cost factor. Small economies mean that in most cases countries have difficulty in financing renewable energy projects that require high upfront capital. Also, regulations have been slow in setting clear rules for grid interconnection. These factors have led some international investors and developers to be cautious about entering the Caribbean market. We can learn from Derek’s example and build on local talent. Indigenous grassroots knowledge paired with the experience and access to capital of larger local and international companies would be a winning combination. The advantage of building on local interest and indigenous talent can be seen in Jamaica. The late Raymond Wright was trained as a petroleum geologist and was head of the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ) in the 1970s. His interest in wind energy was piqued while searching for areas with suitable geological characteristics for petroleum development. It soon became evident that Jamaica had a significant wind resource. Over time Wright shifted the focus of his energy development to renewables and PCJ took on a leading role in the establishment of the Wigton Wind Farm, which now generates about 0.1 % of Jamaica’s energy. Jamaica is keen to build on Wright’s legacy. Expansion of the wind farm is under way and Jamaica plans to increase renewable energy use further, with a goal to reach 20% by 2030, as part of its Vision 2030 policy. There are plans for 20 MW of PV solar to be installed to compliment the wind farm. In addition, Jamaica is offering benefits for any company or individual selling electricity to the grid from a renewable source. Back in Derek’s home island of Barbados, there is a story of another pioneer, the late Professor Oliver Headley. An organic chemist by training, he became a leading international voice for solar energy development. He got into developing renewable energy in the 1960s after a PhD student colleague challenged him to put the sun that was beating down on them daily to productive use. His pioneering efforts helped propel Barbados to a leader in solar water heater use in the western hemisphere. There are three solar water heater companies in Barbados and more than half of households have heaters installed, which can be written off against income tax. This policy has been in place since 1974. The story goes that the then prime minister installed a solar water heater on his house and was so impressed with the results that he put the economic incentives in place. Barbados is keen to expand the success of solar water heaters to solar photovoltaic with the introduction of the “renewable energy rider”. This allows people installing solar photovoltaics to sell their power back to the grid at 1.6 times the usual charge. As a result of this incentive, there are now more than 300 house-top PV systems in the island, and that is expanding. There is every possibility now that we will see more Dereks by 2020 and beyond, Barbados has set itself an ambitious goal of 29% of energy to be produced from renewable sources by 2029. A few other Caribbean countries have seen success with renewable energy. The Dutch Caribbean has led the way in terms of wind energy, with Curacao, Bonaire and Aruba all having significant generation capacity. The political connection to the Netherlands has helped with technical expertise and there has been economic support from the Dutch government. Jamaica has been able to build on the know-how of Dutch Caribbean countries in their own wind development. Nevis, St Lucia and Dominica have all sought to develop geothermal energy projects, which is another source of renewable energy that has potential in the Caribbean. The Organisation of American States and the World Bank have provided capacity and financing support. It is encouraging to see developments such as these. The groundwork has been laid through efforts of pioneers such as Wright and Headley and there are more grassroots leaders like Derek emerging. But the efforts of individual champions cannot be successful without policies, legislation and economic incentives, which governments are slowly but surely putting in place. Having these policies on the books without recognising and supporting local businesses or providing an environment through which champions can come to the fore is likely to impede the progress of this spectacularly beautiful but vulnerable region in developing a flourishing green economy.

The intensive water use in the coal, oil, gas and nuclear industries is well-documented, but if we want to encourage a faster transition to renewables we must also contemplate the water use of the alternatives. It is a great challenge to limit the drain on land and water resources now the transition has taken off. Bioenergy, hydropower, and wind, solar and geothermal energy all require substantial amounts of land and water resources. Given limitations to the availability of land and water, what energy scenarios are feasible in the long run? With fossil fuels we have learned to worry about energy scarcity as a major concern for economic development and national security. In contrast, renewable energy seems inexhaustible: incoming solar radiation, for example, is far beyond what we need. The fact that renewable energy is available into infinity reinforces this idea of limitlessness. This, however, is a misunderstanding: we will replace energy scarcity by land and water scarcity. Biofuels Bioenergy production in particular requires vast amounts of land and water. Besides, with current energy-intensive agricultural practices, net energy output is far lower than gross energy production, sometimes even near zero. If only 10% of fossil fuels in the global transport sector were replaced by bioethanol from relatively efficient crops, global water demand would increase by 6-7%. The production of biofuels at the rate we are used to consuming fossil fuels will require more land and water than sustainably available. Already today we have land and water footprints beyond maximum sustainable levels and bioenergy increasingly competing with food. Hydropower and the dam debate Hydropower, accounting for 16% of the world’s electricity supply, is regarded as a clean form of energy. However, we cannot simply increase hydroelectric capacity. Dams can heavily impact on riparian ecosystems and societies, and any further damming of rivers should be subject to careful consideration. Building new dams and reservoirs is often difficult because the required land is generally already in use for other purposes. For the Three Gorges Dam in China, over one million people were displaced. Besides, hydropower can be a large water consumer because of the additional evaporation from the reservoir created, which affects downstream water availability for other purposes. Damming rivers has therefore become a contentious topic. Solar, wind and geothermal energy Per unit of energy, the water footprint of bioenergy and hydroelectricity is two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of fossil fuels and nuclear. The water footprint of photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy is one to two orders of magnitude smaller. Electricity from concentrated solar power has a similar water footprint to fossil fuels, while geothermal can be an order of magnitude smaller or even less. From a water consumption and scarcity perspective, it matters greatly whether we shift from fossil energy to bio and hydro or to solar, wind and geothermal energy. All existing “green” energy scenarios, called “green” because of their considerable fractions of renewable energy, are based on considerable growth of bio and hydro in the mix, which means that the water footprint of the energy sector will grow sky-high if we follow such scenarios. True green scenarios, with a declining rather than increasing water footprint, must be primarily based on solar, wind and geothermal energy. The transition to electricity Solar energy is more efficient than biomass from a land use perspective because PV panels and concentrated solar power systems are more efficient at capturing incoming solar radiation than photosynthesis, thus generating more energy per square metre. Photosynthesis, however, has the advantage that it results in storable bioenergy and can be turned into energy-dense biofuels, while PV results in non-storable electricity. Concentrated solar power systems can store energy by use of thermal energy storage, but the final product will still be electricity, not fuel. Since substantial growth of bioenergy – beyond using rest streams of organic material – is impossible, our economies need to be further electrified: electric transport, but also electric heating, at least where surplus heat from industrial processes or geothermal energy doesn’t offer a solution. We need to find ways to store energy and design electrical grids that can handle the large variability of both electricity demand and supply. Solar and wind power and earth’s heat offer possibilities to achieve energy self-sufficiency at much smaller scales than we are used to in our globalised fossil fuel economy. The time is ripe for a transition away from fossil fuels. Let’s be smart enough to invest in real sustainable solutions, which excludes biofuels that have been so much at the centre of attention in government policies. Decarbonising our economy can be combined with lowering our water footprint, let’s go for that choice. The water hub is funded by Grundfos.

The report analysed a decade of money going into nine national and two international funds set up to tackle climate change. Of the $7.6bn in funding that the ODI looked at, half of it was going to just ten countries. The chart below shows how much each country received in financing and how much of that was for mitigating the effects of climate change. However, the figures also shows that many countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change are missing out on financing. Countries such as Namibia, El Salvador and Guatemala all received less than $5m each (fewer than 1/100th of what the top countries get). Some of the projects benefitting from the funds included a massive increase in Mexico’s renewable energy capacity in a system previously powered by fossil fuels; the development of Morocco’s solar energy resources and Brazil reforesting 3,000 hectares of land. Of the funds that they looked at, the UK pledged the most contributions of any country at $2.5bn, with the US giving $2.4bn. ODI research fellow and report author, Smita Nakhooda said: These start-up climate funds were pioneering in their approach, and a huge amount has been learnt from their experience. There are now too many small climate funding ‘pots’ with substantial overlap and finance is spread too thinly between them, creating an urgent need to learn from experience and improve the system. The lives of millions of people in poor countries affected by climate change depend on getting this right. Next year will see the roll out of a new green climate fund, which has already raised almost $10bn in seven months. This is more than these other schemes raised in a decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/across-the-universe/2015/mar/14/esas-solar-orbiter-mission-crucial-milestone","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-14T17:05:22Z","webTitle":"Esa’s Solar Orbiter mission passes crucial milestone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/mar/14/esas-solar-orbiter-mission-crucial-milestone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/mar/14/esas-solar-orbiter-mission-crucial-milestone","fields":{"headline":"Esa’s Solar Orbiter mission passes crucial milestone","bodyText":"It is hard not to be impressed with the spacecraft standing in the clean room at Airbus Defence and Space, Stevenage. It is a test model for a spacecraft that will travel closer to the Sun than any mission yet flown. Called Solar Orbiter, it will have to contend with almost 13 times more solar energy than we receive on Earth. This will cause the temperature of its sunward-facing side to soar to 600°C. The heat must be radiated away or it will destroy the spacecraft. “Thermal management is always difficult on a spacecraft, but on this mission it’s epic,” says Tim Horbury at Imperial College, London, who is the principal investigator on the spacecraft’s magnetometer instrument. Protecting the spacecraft from the burning glare of the Sun is a high-tech parasol made of layers of titanium and insulating material. It is just 40 centimetres thick, yet it will channel most of the heat away to the side of the spacecraft. Instruments will peep through trap doors in the sunshield to make the scientific observations. If a lens cracks under the heat, opening an unprotected channel for the sunlight into the spacecraft, the trapdoor will shut and protect the interior. Airbus have now completed the Structural and Thermal Model of the spacecraft. This will be shipped for testing to the Esa’s test facilities in the Netherlands to see whether the spacecraft can handle the extreme heat. Once these tests are passed, Airbus will build the Flight Model to be blasted into space in 2017. Solar Orbiter will cross the orbit of Mercury, drawing to within 42m km of the Sun. “This is the closest that we can go and still point instruments at the Sun,” says Christopher Owen, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Surrey. Owen is in charge of three sensors that will measure the composition of the solar wind. The current record holder is Nasa’s Helios 2 spacecraft, which approached to within 43.5m km of the Sun on 17 April 1976. Earth orbits at 150m km from the Sun. Nasa are currently building a solar mission of their own called Solar Probe Plus. It will blast off just after Solar Orbiter but will get to the Sun more quickly and go much closer, travelling to just 6 million kilometres above the solar surface. Here it will be too close to look at the Sun directly. Instead it will study the gases and the magnetic field emanating from the star. These data will be compared with those from the more distant Solar Orbiter to see exactly how these disturbances travel through space. “The missions are complimentary. There is a strong crossover in personnel between the two,” says Horbury. “It shows how compelling this science is. We’ve managed to persuade both agencies (Esa and Nasa) that this is worthwhile.” The spacecraft will be studying how the Sun generates “space weather” through the interaction of its atmospheric gases with its magnetic field. Space weather events, sometimes called solar storms, have the power to disrupt electronics and communications on Earth. Solar Orbiter is designed to unlock the science of these events so that better monitoring and forecasting can be possible in the future. Solar Orbiter is the second Esa science spacecraft to be delivered by Airbus in as many weeks. Pure science missions are the lifeblood of a strong industrial space sector, according to Chris Castelli, director of programmes at the UK Space Agency. He said that the exacting demands of frontier science provided strong technological challenges to industry, which helped the industry maintain a skilled workforce and provide inspiration for the next generation of engineers.

In his day, fossil fuel was a liberating force – it literally changed the face of the earth, freeing many people from toil. The family business is now philanthropy; at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which I chair, we use the money made from Standard Oil to advance social change that contributes to a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world. But the key phrase in the encomium above is “in his day”. Consider the words of my great-great grandfather’s rough contemporary, the poet James Russell Lowell, which he wrote about slavery and would later become a resounding hymn: “New occasions teach new duties; time makes ancient good uncouth; they must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.” The new occasion in this case comes from chemistry and physics; in our great universities, scientists have shown that by burning fossil fuel we are overheating the planet. They have made it clear that roughly 80% of the fossil fuel reserves already identified on this planet must remain underground. We’re not talking about radicals here: recently, for instance, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said “the vast majority” of the planet’s coal, oil, and gas reserves simply can’t be burned if the world is to meet its target of keeping temperature rise below two degrees. The science leads to two conclusions, both of which prompted the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a foundation led by both family and non-family trustees, to begin divesting its holdings in fossil fuels. The first is that it’s immoral to continue down the fossil fuel path. We know that alternatives exist – indeed, late last year the International Energy Agency said that for the poorest people on earth, solar energy was a better path even than cheap coal for getting the energy they desperately need. We also know that the poorest among us will pay the heaviest price for unchecked climate change. As Desmond Tutu has declared, climate change is the human rights challenge of our time. The second conclusion is that it’s financially imprudent to stay invested in companies whose profits depend on defying both physics and the international effort to restrain climate change. HSBC, for instance, has noted that if the world moves to meet its 2C target, the valuations of many fossil fuel companies would fall by half or more. Some of my family members and other notable partners have made this case with the executives of Exxon, the company our family founded. Many have urged them to turn their great pools of capital, and wealth of technical expertise toward becoming an energy company, not a fossil fuel company. But these attempts at engagement have not sufficed. Thus, although we will hold on to a few shares to have the right to continue to try to influence company policy, we have begun to divest, and to look for ways to invest that money into the energy of the future. We applaud others who have taken the same steps: we were inspired by organizations like the World Council of Churches, and by renowned institutions like Stanford University. We’re glad that the same movement has spread to Europe, where Glasgow University has begun the same process, and to Australia where first-rate institutions, including the University of Sydney and the Australian National University have taken steps along the same path. We know that they will all encounter opposition from those with a vested interest in the status quo, but we know too that young people in particular will thank them for their efforts. Young people, of course, are the ones who must live with the world we are building now. We all must work together, however, around the world as well as across generations. Times change – what was right once, is now wrong – and new innovations beckon.

Iran and the western powers reached a landmark agreement on circumscribing Tehran’s controversial nuclear programme. Israel was unhappy, as were Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states – but most of the rest of the world breathed a deep sigh of relief. The year brought signs of progress – at long last – on the global effort to fight climate change, after negotiators from nearly 200 countries signed up to an ambitious deal to limit temperature rise. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel inspired many across Europe by opening her country’s borders to Middle Eastern refugees, at considerable cost to her personal political position. From Argentina to Myanmar, where Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi led an opposition landslide election victory ending absolute army rule, several countries enjoyed an overdue fresh start. In China, the Communist party finally revoked its oppressive one-child policy. And in Havana and Washington DC, the flags of the former arch-foes were hoisted once again following the restoration of diplomatic relations. But it was also a year of many more frightening and tragic events. From the ungoverned spaces of northern Nigeria and eastern Syria to the cruel shores of Greece and Turkey, from the streets of Paris to the holiday resorts of Tunisia and Egypt, from the waters of the South China Sea to the icy sea-lanes of the North Atlantic, 2015 was a year of tumult, terror and transition. More than ever, it was a year of living dangerously. Conflicts and confrontations The year saw the coming of age, in the worst possible sense, of Islamic State (Isis) and those who claim to be inspired or directed by the terrorist group. Isis’s expanding reach brought mass murder to Kuwait, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Tunisia and Paris. In the French capital the year began with an attack on a kosher supermarket by a man who had declared allegiance to Isis (the Charlie Hebdo attacks were claimed by an al-Qaida affiliate in Yemen), and drew to a close amid the carnage of another, even more murderous assault in the French capital. Meanwhile its gross depredations in its self-declared caliphate in northern Syria and Iraq continued largely unchecked despite intensified bombing by a US-led multinational coalition, reinforced in December by Britain. Growing mayhem sparked urgent debate in western capitals about the radicalisation of young European Muslims, the global spread of jihadi ideology, increased state security and surveillance powers, the need for a settlement of Syria’s civil war, and the desirability or otherwise of expanded military intervention on the ground. Two things, at least, became clear: in the short term, the international community remains badly divided over exactly what to do about Isis’s reign of terror; and in the longer term a way has to be found of defusing the Sunni Muslim revolt that has been building across the Arab world since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The year saw a range of sometimes related, similarly dangerous conflicts in Nigeria, where Boko Haram Islamists attacked Muslims and Christians alike; in Libya, where post-Gaddafi chaos deepened; and in Afghanistan, where fears increased of a Taliban and al-Qaida comeback following Nato’s withdrawal. Tensions rose in the East and South China Seas, where China’s maritime expansionism and military build-up encountered strengthening but so far non-violent US resistance. Japan, in particular, expressed concern about Beijing’s ambitions, which include the building of artificial islands and air strips on disputed South China Sea reefs, and stepped up its own defence spending. With presidential elections due in January in Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, and with China rejecting a Philippines bid for international legal arbitration, regional stresses and strains look set to increase in 2016. Elsewhere in east Asia there were signs of a mild thaw in relations between Japan and South Korea in the face of the common menace posed by North Korea. Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang’s podgy panjandrum, purged his officials, threatened Seoul with a blitzkrieg, and warned the US it could be hit “any time” by his nuclear weapons and missiles. In eastern Ukraine, in contrast, tensions reduced after Russian-backed secessionists reluctantly accepted the Minsk peace accord negotiated by Angela Merkel. In South Sudan, meanwhile, a dreadful civil war entered its third year amid the failure of successive ceasefire deals. Ethnic cleansing, child soldier recruitment and mass rape were among horrors spawned by a conflict that has displaced 2.3 million people, left 4.6 million in need of emergency food aid, and killed tens of thousands. Now, the UN is warning of a “concrete risk of famine”. All these conflict zones remain active and potentially volatile as 2016 dawns. Emergencies and extremists Europe confronted its biggest existential challenge since the darkest days of the cold war as the steady flow of refugees from internecine war, political unrest, economic failure and climate change in the Middle East, south Asia and Africa turned into an apparently unstoppable torrent of human misery. By year’s end, Germany alone was close to a figure of 1 million new arrivals in 2015, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Having bravely opened Germany’s borders as a matter of humanitarian principle, Merkel was under growing pressure to shut the door as her poll ratings plunged. Sweden, a traditional haven for asylum seekers, has already done so, while others, notably Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Slovenia, started building frontier walls in a return to the pre-1989 era. Further afield, fear of Islamist terrorism and ugly anti-Muslim prejudice brought shameful calls in the US, a nation built by immigrants, for an outright ban or forced registration of all Muslims. Driven by increasingly angry, public disagreements and a shambolic official response, the migrant crisis threatened to destabilise or even break apart the EU. Voter support for xenophobic, nationalist and far right parties increased in France, Poland, Denmark, Britain and Germany. This instability looks certain to continue in to 2016, fed by a continuing refugee influx and rising extremism. In Greece, unchecked migration compounded the extraordinary difficulties arising from the country’s near bankruptcy. For a time in 2015 it seemed Athens, under its new leftwing government, would crash out of the euro, triggering a wider currency and market collapse. A last-minute compromise was found. But the crushing debt burden on southern European states was not removed, only temporarily eased. As for that other emergency – the one facing the whole world, climate change – a key country remained out of step. Even as it launched a global solar energy initiative, India insisted it would continue its rapid expansion of coal-fired power stations, placing economic development for its 1.25 billion people ahead of environmental responsibility. Eighteen months after his election, Narendra Modi, India’s nationalist prime minister, remains a divisive figure. But after his ruling party suffered a stunning election defeat in November in Bihar, India’s third most populous state – a vote he had called a referendum on his premiership – it appeared Modi’s popular appeal could be on the wane. Democrats and dictators Democratic governance had a mixed year. Canadian voters turned their backs on a decade of Conservative rule, electing Justin Trudeau, age 43, son of the late Pierre, as prime minister. This was despite, or perhaps because of, his unconventional policy platform that included legalising cannabis and ending Canadian military involvement in Syria and Iraq. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Malta, the Queen, age 89, complained Trudeau made her feel old. At the other end of the world, Australia’s loquacious prime minister, Tony Abbott, was ousted in an internal party coup, without the benefit of a national vote. Few tears were shed over his sudden departure, especially not by would-be immigrants held in offshore asylum camps that have besmirched Australia’s international reputation. In Turkey, two general elections in 2015 finally produced the result ordained by the country’s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In the first vote, in June, Erdoğan’s ruling party inadvertently lost its overall majority, due largely to a surge of support for a pro-Kurdish party. Erdoğan responded by tearing up the ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) and encouraging – so said his critics – a sense of national insecurity. It seemed to work. Frightened voters were shaken in particular by the deadliest bomb attack in Turkey’s recent history which Erdoğan condemned as a terrorist act and a “heinous attack on our unity”. His Justice and Development party won back its majority in November. Argentina experienced what observers called a transformative election. Victory for Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, brought an end to more than decade of dirigiste and bombastic Peronist rule. In Guatemala, a former comedian, Jimmy Morales, won the presidency on an anti-corruption platform, following his jailed predecessor’s disgrace. Unlike Trudeau in Canada, one of his first acts was to restate his opposition to decriminalising narcotics. Thanks in large part to Pope Francis, who made a ground-breaking visit to Havana in September, 2015 was the year Cuba finally came in from the cold. And amid widely-shared relief, Iran’s theocratic leadership at last approved a nuclear deal with the western powers, meaning trade and other sanctions may soon be lifted. The deal was seen as a fillip for the country’s quasi-moderate leader, President Hassan Rouhani. But Iran’s record on human rights and free speech remains dismal, and its hoped-for cooperation on ending the Syrian war has yet to materialise in concrete form. Matters proceeded much less smoothly in Burundi where President Pierre Nkurunziza unwisely insisted on seeking a third consecutive term in office, despite a constitutional prohibition and public opposition. Predictably, his power grab provoked worsening violence and mass flight. In Russia, meanwhile, the rule of Vladimir Putin continued intact despite the damaging impact of western sanctions, imposed after his annexation of Crimea, and spending cuts necessitated by falling oil revenues. Notwithstanding the absence of free speech and open debate, Putin could face trouble in 2016 if the economy continues to contract. The president stepped up his confrontational policy of sending Russian bombers and submarines to probe western defences in the North Atlantic and Baltic in 2015, part of his vainglorious attempt to re-establish Russia as a global superpower. He also intervened militarily in Syria on the side of that country’s dictator, President Bashar al-Assad. But Putin received a comeuppance in November, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane it said had violated its airspace. In China, home of the world’s last great Communist dictatorship, President Xi Jinping tightened his grip on the organs of power and on media and civil society organisations, attempting to compensate for an economic downturn by increasing centralised control. This, too, could spell trouble down the road. David Cameron’s obsequious treatment of Xi during a state visit to the UK drew the contempt of human rights campaigners. In the US, the 2016 presidential election drew inexorably closer, with Hillary Clinton emerging as the Democrats’ most likely nominee to replace Barack Obama. On the Republican side, a series of often raucous and unpleasant televised candidates debates showed how far the GOP has drifted to the right. The racist and misogynistic antics of Donald Trump, a property developer who topped party polls, may have permanently tainted the Republican cause in the eyes of mainstream voters. In New Zealand, finally, nothing much happened of political significance in 2015, although there was a noisy parliamentary bust-up over male attitudes to sexual assault. The untimely death of Jonah Lomu, one of rugby union’s all-time greats, was widely mourned. Oh, and the All Blacks won the Rugby World Cup – again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/08/community-energy-model-is-speeding-us-move-to-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-08T12:30:02Z","webTitle":"Community energy model is speeding US move to renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/08/community-energy-model-is-speeding-us-move-to-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/08/community-energy-model-is-speeding-us-move-to-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Community energy model is speeding US move to renewables","bodyText":"Sewage and solar power may be odd bedfellows in the race to save the climate. But in Sonoma County, one hour north of San Francisco, an experiment is underway to install the nation’s largest floating solar array on a series of wastewater treatment ponds. The sprawling 12.5MW Megawatt “flotovoltaic” park due for completion in 2016 covers 38 acres, or the area of 35 football fields, in a farming and vineyard region where real estate costs are at a premium. The project signals the growing clout of Sonoma Clean Power, a new government-run agency that has made this county of 500,000 the lead producer of solar energy per capita in America. At 310 watts of installed power per person, Sonoma has five times the national average. Since launching last May, the programme says it has saved 100,000 metric tonnes in emissions – the equivalent of taking 21,000 vehicles off the road – while lowering consumers’ energy bills 6-9%. Now, this publicly-run model to finance and produce clean energy is leading a nationwide movement as communities look to speed the US transition toward renewable power, with similar programs flourishing from Massachusetts and Rhode Island to New Jersey, Ohio and Illinois. Known as Community Choice Aggregation, or CCA, programmes like Sonoma’s are bringing competition into power generation by letting cities and counties decide where their energy comes from. Geof Syphers, CEO of Sonoma Clean Power, likens the market-driven model to an energy “bank,” because “it’s a way of taking on debt in the form of power contracts, and producing income in the form of energy bills”. He added: “[CCAs are] taking a huge amount of revenues that used to leave the county, bringing them back under local control, and buying cleaner power.” The model functions by agencies signing contracts to buy power from private companies generating solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biogas and other clean sources of energy; that’s the “debt”. The traditional investor-owned utilities, which still control and maintain the power grid, distribute that clean energy to customers whose electricity bills shift to paying the agencies instead of them – providing governments with the “income” they need to pay off the energy contract debts and invest in further clean power. Ratepayers have a choice of whether to receive cleaner electricity at reduced cost through agency management, or to opt out and continue using conventional fossil fuel-based power produced by large utilities. In Sonoma, the market has spoken in favour of clean energy. Here, solar arrays mounted on more than 7,000 residences and businesses dot the landscape. Other recent large-scale projects contracted through Sonoma Clean Power include a 70MW solar plant in Lemoore, California, and a 50MW deal bringing geothermal power from nearby geysers – a combined electricity output to power 70,000 homes. Two new CCA programmes go online this summer: Lancaster Choice Energy in southern California, and Sustainable Westchester in Westchester County, serving 360,000 people in more than two dozen towns and cities outside New York City. Delaware is now looking to implement the community choice model, and even Utah – a Western state heavily reliant on coal and gas production – seeks to use CCAs to provide urban areas like Salt Lake City and Park City with clean power. Currently, Cincinnati is the largest US city with green energy aggregation, after Chicago last month announced its return to its traditional electricity supplier because the city’s renewables programme failed to deliver competitive enough prices. There is another problem in the Midwest, where clean energy programmes have at times failed to reduce emissions. In Illinois, for example, more than 650 communities switched their power source through contracts with alternative retail energy suppliers (ARES). But many of those suppliers offer only voluntary clean power options and buy Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which “green up” their energy supply without adding emissions-free power to the mix. “They haven’t actually purchased the clean power – what they’ve purchased is the certificates that allow them to say it’s clean, and instead purchased power through fossil fuels,” said Shawn Marshall, co-founder and director of LEAN Energy US, which tracks community choice programs nationwide. “We’re saying, do more: leverage your buying power to radically shift to clean energy.” In California, that radical shift is happening. Marin Clean Energy (MCE) supplies renewable power to 165,000 customers across four northern California counties, and shaved $6m off consumers’ bills last year. More than 20 cities and counties statewide are pushing to establish CCA programmes – from Napa, Alameda and Santa Clara counties in the Bay Area, to Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Diego in the south. San Francisco will launch a CCA later this year.Under governor Jerry Brown’s new ambitious climate goals, the state aims to produce 50% of its power from renewables, cut vehicle fuel use in half, and double the energy efficiency in buildings by 2030. “People here are trying to think really big and change the world. We have to try things, even if we fail,” said Syphers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2015/jul/12/coalition-bans-clean-energy-finance-corporation-wind-power-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T02:39:48Z","webTitle":"Coalition bans government's clean energy bank from financing wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/12/coalition-bans-clean-energy-finance-corporation-wind-power-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2015/jul/12/coalition-bans-clean-energy-finance-corporation-wind-power-investment","fields":{"headline":"Coalition bans government's clean energy bank from financing wind power","bodyText":"The federal government has ordered the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) not to make any future investments in wind power, instead focussing on “emerging technologies”, trade minister Andrew Robb has confirmed. Fairfax media reported on Sunday that the treasurer, Joe Hockey, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, bypassed the environment minister, Greg Hunt, in issuing the CEFC with the directive. Robb told Sky News on Sunday that that was “a total beat-up”. “Greg was fully cognisant of what was decided,” he said. “He was perhaps the principle party, along with [resources minister] Ian Macfarlane, who put together this arrangement with the crossbenchers, and he is fully cognisant of it, drove this deal and settled this deal, understood this arrangement. And now the two responsible ministers are putting it into effect.” Hunt took to Twitter on Sunday to refute the claims made in Fairfax, labelling them “factually wrong and misleading”. “Claims that I have been ‘angered’ are a complete, absolute and utter fabrication,” he said via the social media platform. “I’ve been repeatedly critical of the CEFC investing taxpayer funds in projects such as existing wind farms, rather than focusing on solar and emerging technologies. Our policy is to abolish the CEFC but in the meantime it should focus on solar and emerging technologies as was originally intended.” The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the Coalition was balancing consumer needs with environmental responsibilities. “This is a government that supports renewables, but obviously we want to support renewables at the same time as putting downward pressure on power prices,” he told reporters in Darwin. Labor and the Coalition struck a deal in May to lower the renewable energy target (RET) to 33,000 gigawatt hours. The Coalition later negotiated a deal with the Senate crossbench for native wood waste to be included in the RET, in exchange for the creation of a wind commissioner. The new position, which would examine claims of negative health effects from wind turbines, appeased the concerns of some anti-wind senators. The negotiation also included the clause to “significantly” increase the uptake of solar energy, overlooking the existing windfarm industry. The sector has reacted to the funding news by expressing disappointment. “The CEFC’s primary focus has always been on financing exciting new technologies rather than more commercial renewable energy such as wind. But reports today of an overt directive preventing CEFC from investing in wind reinforces a growing perception that renewable energy investors are not welcome in Australia,” said the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, Kane Thornton. “In the midst of a global race to attract investment and jobs in renewable energy, Australia has just thrown another weight in its own saddle bag.” Robb said the directive for the CEFC not to fund future wind projects was in line with the arrangement struck with the crossbench. “There will be some negotiation, but the essence of it is that that money is to be spent on emerging technology, not mature technology,” he said. “If it’s seeking to support the mature technology that exists with wind power, it won’t be making those sorts of investments.” The independent senator Nick Xenophon, who is part of the select Senate committee into wind turbines, welcomed the announcement, providing the funding was put into other projects like solar. “Wind power is something that has been well established,” he told ABC News on Sunday. “So long as we see a shift from wind to large-scale solar and other forms of renewables, that is a good thing.” “You’ll find that if you change the parameters it will inevitably mean more investment of large-scale solar.” Labor said the decision to stop investment in wind was part of the Coalition’s “relentless attack on the renewable energy industry”. “How a prime minister and treasurer can so blatantly undermine thousands of Australian jobs and billions of dollars in investment is beyond comprehension,” the opposition’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, said. “Tony Abbott is abusing his office and the cabinet process by pursuing his own anti-wind ideology, enlisting fellow wind haters Joe Hockey to help bring down a whole industry.” Last month Abbott described turbines as “visually awful”, and Hockey had earlier labelled them “utterly offensive”. The CEFC was set up by the former Gillard government, and the Coalition’s policy is to abolish it altogether. “It is our policy to abolish the CEFC because we think that if the projects stack up economically, there’s no reason why they can’t be supported in the usual way,” Abbott said. “We weren’t able to abolish the CEFC as we’d wished, but while it’s there, it really should do what the private sector won’t normally do and that is invest in new and emerging technologies.” The deputy Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said: “Tony Abbott has tried twice to completely shut down the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, but the Senate has said no both times – setting up a double dissolution trigger. “The prime minister is clearly not keen to go to an election on his climate credentials, and now he’s just digging himself in deeper.” The acting Greens leader, Scott Ludlam, told reporters in Perth that Abbott was trying to “handcuff” Australia to the coal and gas industry. “It’s a form of, I think incredibly dangerous and vindictive industrial sabotage. They’re trying to knock over the wind energy sector,” he said. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government was “sabotaging” the industry due to “political extreme ideology against windfarms”. “The guidelines now being proposed by Mr Abbott mean that basically the only thing the CEFC could invest in is flying saucers, because anything that is any closer to development than that, Mr Abbott has conveniently saying is an established technology.” Shorten said is “personally supportive” of having the CEFC continue beyond 2020. “Tony Abbott never looks forward. He is always looking backwards,” Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, told ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday. “I have farmers, including in places like Victoria, who are now hoping to rely upon the incomes that come from these wind turbines ... and, of course, he is now out to stifle billions of dollars of investment in a technology and, of course, the creation of many jobs. “I believe Tony Abbott’s becoming a very real threat to the Australian way of life. This guy is out of control.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/apr/14/rise-and-shine-rosettas-philae-probe-could-be-awake-within-weeks","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-14T15:14:40Z","webTitle":"Rise and shine: Rosetta's Philae probe could be awake within weeks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/14/rise-and-shine-rosettas-philae-probe-could-be-awake-within-weeks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/apr/14/rise-and-shine-rosettas-philae-probe-could-be-awake-within-weeks","fields":{"headline":"Rise and shine: Rosetta's Philae probe could be awake within weeks","bodyText":"The Rosetta mission’s hibernating lander could awake within weeks, according to new predictions that it will soon be receiving enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. The Philae probe shut down just three days after making a spectacular, but bumpy, landing on the duck-shaped comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and has been in a dormant state ever since. Despite making it to within half a mile of its target on the comet’s “head”, after a 250 million mile journey through space, the lander came to rest in the shadow of a cliff meaning that its solar-powered batteries have been unable to recharge since November. As the comet approaches the sun, the lander will be experiencing more intense sunlight, and the latest analysis suggest it could enter its re-booting routine within weeks. Stephan Ulamec, the lander manager, said: “What we’ve learnt is that the power will probably be sufficient ... The lander may be able to boot in April or May.” For it to switch back on, two key conditions need to be met, Ulamec added. First, the interior of the lander needs to be at least -45C before it can be switched back on safely. “The lander is designed in a way that if the temperature is below -45C, power on board would be used for heating rather than booting the computer,” said Ulamec. Second, Philae needs to be able to harvest enough energy from its solar panels to reboot and re-establish communication with its mothership Rosetta, which is tracking the comet from around 200km away. It is already receiving more than twice the amount of solar energy than in November, the scientists calculate, based on their best estimates of the position of the lander. “The situation is improving every day as we’re approaching the sun, but we are very cold - this is the problem,” Ulamec told the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, in Vienna today. Assuming the interior of the lander warms up enough, the Rosetta team predict that communications could be re-established by May or June and that by July and September Philae is likely to be getting enough energy to recharge its batteries, allowing it to continue operations at “night-time”, when it is not in direct sunlight. Ultimately, it may be possible to re-operate the lander’s drill and collect more surface samples, which would be baked in a small on-board oven to analyse the gases given off. In November, a drilling attempt was not completely successful, and scientists are not sure if the sample was collected properly. “I would dream of having another sample from the surface,” said Ulamec. “At the start we’ll have to be more modest though.” Scientists now know that when deployed in November, Philae rebounded twice from the comet’s surface before coming to a final standstill. Although this ultimately left the craft asleep in the shade, it did mean that data was obtained from several points on the surface. A new analysis of these results, together with measurements made by Rosetta, have shown that, contrary to prior expectations, the comet does not have its own magnetic field. “The unplanned flight across the surface actually meant we could collect precise magnetic field measurements with Philae at the four points we made contact with, and at a range of heights above the surface,” said Hans-Ulrich Auster, a Rosetta scientists and lead author of the findings published today in the journal Science. The discovery challenges one of the leading theories on how comets and the precursors of planets first began to form in the infant solar system. Initially, the sun was surrounded by just a swirling disc of gas and dust and it was thought that magnetic fields, created by charged particles flowing from the sun, may have played an important role in drawing together clumps of material in space, like iron filings being pulled in by a magnet. The latest measurements found no evidence that magnetic material such as iron is organised within the comet 67P, which it would have been if magnetism had first drawn it together. Andrew Coates, head of planetary science at UCL’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “The problem with solar system formation has always been what gets it going in the first place.” According to Ulamec: “One leading theory has to be deleted from the textbook now.” The findings suggest that swarms of particles may have simply stuck together when they happened to bump into each other, eventually snowballing into masses big enough to have sufficient gravity to accumulate further material."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/planet-oz/2015/jul/08/liberals-attack-on-climate-science-is-groundless-ignorant-and-embarrassing-say-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T05:47:17Z","webTitle":"Liberals attack climate science ahead of Australia's emissions pledge | Graham Readfearn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2015/jul/08/liberals-attack-on-climate-science-is-groundless-ignorant-and-embarrassing-say-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/planet-oz/2015/jul/08/liberals-attack-on-climate-science-is-groundless-ignorant-and-embarrassing-say-scientists","fields":{"headline":"Liberals' attack on climate science is 'embarrassing', say scientists","bodyText":"Now is probably not the best time – if there ever was one – for a minority within Australia’s Liberal party to be excreting climate science denialist brain farts. The government is expected to announce within a week or two its proposed target to cut greenhouse gas emissions beyond the year 2020. This will be the target Australia takes to December’s international climate talks in Paris and it will further put the Australian government under international scrutiny. So far, there is a substantial gap between the supposed agreement to keep global warming below 2C and the levels of cuts governments say they’re willing to make to get there. But one smallish rump of the Liberal party – a rump some within the party might like to have removed – thinks the whole climate science thing needs a review before Australia signs anything in France. Here’s a quick recap. The Liberal party’s regional and rural committee put a motion to the party’s national council meeting to: … examine the scientific evidence that underpins the man-made global warming theory and investigate the reasons for the failure of computer models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and prominent individuals to predict, among other things, the pause in global warming this century. Liberal MP Dennis Jensen and Liberal senator Chris Back supported the motion, but rather than hold a debate it was referred to the party’s policy committee. Twelve scientists then wrote to Jensen and Back, offering to brief them on the science. Jensen accepted. Jensen claimed to the ABC there were “at least 10” members of his party who shared his climate denialist tendencies. With some prodding from ABC Radio National host Fran Kelly, Jensen set out why he thought the science needed a review. Why not just accept the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? No good, said Jensen, because this body was guilty of “institutionalised groupthink”. Jensen was similarly unimpressed with the experts who had co-signed the letter, saying “only two” of the signatories were climate scientists. Because some of the scientists were experts on the impacts of climate change, Jensen dismissed them – presumably because they’re experts in something he doesn’t believe in. Jensen attempted to make some scientific points too. He claimed if carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubled, this would deliver 1.1C of global warming if CO2 was “acting in isolation” which, of course, never happens. Ever. In Jensen’s mind, the evidence that adding CO2 to the atmosphere can kick off feedbacks in the system to create more warming is “not compelling at all”. So “not compelling” is the well-established understanding that CO2 warms the atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour - a greenhouse gas. Presumably “not compelling” either is how as sea ice and snow melts, this exposes darker surfaces beneath, which absorbs more heat and cuts the amount of solar energy reflected back out to space, causing more warming. Jensen also claimed that “98%” of climate models had “way overstated” recent global temperatures. I asked Professor Steve Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales and a lead IPCC author about Jensen’s points (he had more to say too, which we’ll get to at the end). He told me: There is overwhelming theoretical support and observational evidence for positive feedbacks on global temperature. Moreover the climate sensitivity desired by Jensen is inconsistent with Earth’s climate record, which shows 2-5C of warming every time CO2 doubled. You can throw away the climate models and we still know we have a serious problem. Victoria University’s Professor Roger Jones, also an IPCC author, said Jensen’s argument that climate models were overstating warming “did not hold water” and pointed to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change. That study examined global temperatures for every 15-year period from 1900 to 2012 (starting with 1900 to 1914, then 1901 to 1915 and so on) and compared these to temperatures delivered by climate models. The study found no evidence that climate models systematically overestimated global temperatures. Jones said he would not be surprised if the current El Niño delivered a marked shift in global temperatures, as high as 0.3C, and that this would push the planet into a “new regime”. He added: I have no interest in briefing Jensen or his colleagues. The world is doing that quite effectively and speaks with a louder voice than I do. Professor Matthew England, also of the Climate Change Research Centre at UNSW, told me Jensen was being fooled: Jensen is showing a worrying ignorance of the science. And he’s being fooled by dodgy analyses put out by lobby groups determined to delay action on reducing fossil fuel emissions. Colleagues overseas can’t believe we have elected representatives who still don’t get the science. It’s an embarrassment. Jensen said any review into the science would have to be conducted “from people outside the system” which seems to me to be another way of saying “don’t give me any actual experts”. I’m wondering if a Liberal Party review of the science might sound a bit like the Republican-led US House Science Committee hearing last year, reviewed here by Jon Stewart. So who does Jensen think is worth listening to? In September 2013, Jensen promoted the views of that most eccentric of climate science denialists, Lord Christopher Monckton, saying he thought that most of the viscount’s views were “entirely reasonable”. I don’t know if Jensen ever did clarify which of Monckton’s views he thought were reasonable, but the British viscount himself did pen a colourful nine-page response to my questions. Jensen’s parliamentary colleague, the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has a different view of Monckton, once describing him as a “vaudeville artist” and a “professional sensationalist” with “no credibility, politically or scientifically”. So back to Sherwood, who has evidently had enough of the attacks on the credibility of his profession from non-experts. I’ll leave you with his thoughts: If Jensen would like to have scientists investigated yet again, let him do it. If my colleagues or I have been guilty of what the likes of him are claiming, we deserve to go to jail. But please ask him to also investigate climate sceptics, whose claims have repeatedly been shown to rest on misrepresentations of the evidence. I am getting tired of my own integrity and that of my colleagues being questioned for political reasons when our conclusions are based on a deliberate, careful and completely open scientific process, the opposite of “groupthink.” These groundless accusations have gone on for long enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/25/carbon-free-energy-industry-transition","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T12:40:32Z","webTitle":"Experts discuss how to build a carbon-free energy industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/25/carbon-free-energy-industry-transition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/25/carbon-free-energy-industry-transition","fields":{"headline":"Experts discuss how to build a carbon-free energy industry","bodyText":"With the UN Conference on Climate Change (COP) in Paris just days away, a global strategy for reducing carbon emissions is tantalisingly close. Current commitments on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are due to run out in 2020 and governments are convening in Paris to agree a roadmap for what happens in the next decade and beyond. For any such agreement to work, however, it must include a transition from high-carbon, fossil-fuelled energy production, to one where power comes from clean, renewable energy. There are some indications that the energy transition is under way. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently announced that renewable energy accounted for half of all new power plants in 2014, while large oil companies cancelled 80 drilling projects worldwide in 2015. But the IEA also calculates the world is still on course for global warming of 2.7C before the end of the century, significantly above the danger threshold of 2C, with “major implications for us all”. The transition, therefore, must happen sooner and faster. A recent Guardian roundtable, sponsored by global energy company Enel, looked at what the sector can do to pick up the pace of the transition. The chair, Oliver Balch, asked whether politics is holding the transition back. Diminishing subsidies and support for renewables under the current UK government led the World Energy Council [WEC] recently to downgrade the UK from AAA to AAB rating for its energy policy. Energy policy Joan MacNaughton, executive chair of the WEC’s Energy Trilemma study, said: “All countries struggle because no government in a democratic country is going to last very long if they don’t deliver energy security. We have had over 100 years of investment in [fossil fuel infrastructure] and you can’t just turn that [around] overnight.” John Sauven, from longstanding climate change campaigners Greenpeace, surprised the room by saying that “fossil fuels are brilliant”, before caveating “except for the downsides. If it wasn’t for war, air pollution and climate change, you couldn’t beat fossil fuels … [for] bang for your buck.” Governments remain addicted to cheap fossil fuels and the key to weaning them off, said Sauven, “is always politics and policy, because [renewable] technology is increasingly coming in at scale and at cost”. Onshore wind and large scale solar farms, he said, are expected to come to cost parity with gas-fired power stations by the 2020s – the technology is there should politicians choose to back it. Labour MP Daniel Zeichner said the five-year political cycle “just isn’t long enough for a lot of these issues. The only thing that matters to the current government is their notion of ‘balancing the financial books’, and [we have] a weak climate change secretary who’s getting knocked about.” However, Zeichner said the Climate Change Act (2008), which legally binds any incumbent UK government to work towards GHG emissions reduction targets for 2020 and 2050, should not be taken for granted. “Without that we would be completely lost.” Prof Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College, helped draw up the act. He said of the legislation: “It was, and still is, a fantastic thing for giving a long-term view. It was the basis for our 80% reduction in our CO2 by 2050 [target] … and there is no doubt that de-carbonising the electricity supply is number one [in achieving that target].” Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, said there are some “inconvenient truths” that need facing up to. The first being that “almost any form of new clean energy is going to need high upfront investment, with little operating cost for the lifetime of the investment – as opposed to what we’re used to, which is a modest upfront investment followed by a significant operating cost.” This scares off institutional investors, said Clare Hierons, chief operating officer of ShareAction. Moving from large investments in mega-projects to smaller amounts across multiple schemes “means being project financed, which is high cost”. However, she highlighted the Environment Agency pension fund – believed to be the first in the world to ensure its portfolio is compatible with the 2C climate change target – as an example of what is possible. Financing renewable energy in the developing world From the energy industry perspective Enel’s head of European affairs, Simone Mori, stated that energy companies have two options. They are, he said: “Trying to resist [the transition to renewables] to defend the existing picture; or trying to be an agent of the change.” And the best example of change taking place most rapidly is in developing countries, especially in Africa. He added: “Renewables are becoming the best option in the larger geographies … not just for the environment, but for answering energy demand in emerging economies.” Energy entrepreneur Frederik Ottesen, co-founder of solar company Little Sun, argued that delivering solar energy in emerging markets is “hugely profitable”. Solar can deliver more reliable energy and it’s also far more affordable – “one tenth of the price”, said Ottesen – than what many rural Africans currently pay for kerosene-based alternatives, for example. The difficulty he and other renewable energy startups face is upfront cost. “A solar panel lasts 20-30 years, but you have to pay the money right now,” he said. “The people who take out the loan [to pay for the solar panels] aren’t the consumers, it’s the companies delivering the energy. I would have to find $1bn to deliver a sufficient amount of solar panels [to Africa].” The barriers to a low-carbon, renewable energy transition, however, do have solutions. “I would start by explaining to people the fundamentals,” said Delay. One of which, said John O’Brien, regional technical adviser on climate change mitigation, the United Nations Development Programme, is that “fossil fuels are only cheap if you don’t factor in the true environmental cost.” Carbon-trading: EU Emissions Trading Scheme The best way to do that, he said, is having a high price on carbon via a carbon trading market. The EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has done just that since 2005, based on “cap and trade”: a maximum cap is set on the total GHG emissions for regulated industries; those emitting more can buy “carbon allowances” and those emitting less can sell them, or trade them on the open market. The cap itself is lowered over time, bringing overall emissions down. It has, however, been widely criticised for being ineffectual and unstable: too many allowances were allocated, effectively flooding the market. Prices of €30 (£21) per tonne of CO2 in 2006 fell to just €5 a tonne in early 2013. However, the EU ETS is still the largest carbon trading scheme in the world and, with China due to launch its own carbon trading scheme in 2017, there is a possibility to look again at a truly global carbon price, argued O’Brien. There appeared to be unanimous support in the room for a rejuvenated carbon trading market. Mori said: “When the [EU ETS] carbon market was working properly, the price of carbon was an important determinant of our investments and our business plan … the EU could re-engage with this.” Delay also believed that a carbon price reaching €19–€39 a tonne would be enough to drive energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. A sceptical and disengaged British public also needs to be won over to raise this up the political agenda. Simon Hill, vice president, EMEA, at energy consultants Opower, argued that consumers are difficult to engage because “fundamentally, energy efficiency is a dull, boring subject … people think about energy use for nine minutes a year. That’s a difficult barrier to break through.” But Helena Molin Valdés, head of the Secretariat, Climate and Clean Air Coalition, argued that you could change the public’s attitude by warning them: “You will have a heart attack by 59 because of pollution.” She added: “We might think about energy for nine minutes, but health is every day.” Community owned power Greater community ownership of energy production – through domestic solar or part ownership of local authority schemes – was also widely cited as key to engaging consumers while increasing the proportion of clean energy. Zeichner and Sauven told the roundtable about flagship local council schemes doing just that in Southampton and Nottingham, among others. “People get energy when they own it,” said Hierons. The government’s 87% cut in feed-in-tariffs for solar – a subsidy intended to incentivise domestic renewable energy generation with a small payment per kilowatt hour generated, guaranteed for 20 years – was a big blow, said Sauven. The government argued that the renewables industry should survive without subsidies, but it was missing the fact that ownership leads to greater interest in energy efficiency across the board. he added: “We had nearly a million people generating their own power … And there could have been millions more, really engaged in their energy. In Germany and Denmark a percentage has to be community owned. As a result they have a very different attitude.” But the world is far more aligned on climate issues than during COP3 in Kyoto, 1997, said Hoskins. “Kyoto was a case of some countries starting to do something. Now [at Paris] we have virtually all countries saying: ‘We are going to do this.’ They are no longer questioning the problem … If we can see world emissions peak and start to go down, then everything is possible.” MacNaughton was also optimistic. “Saudi Arabia has now published its commitment for Paris – one of the last countries to do so – that’s extremely significant. Each country is trying to manage this transition. Paris could be a fundamental step … to get the energy sector – not just the most forward-looking companies, but all of them – to recognise that this is the new reality.” Carbon-free energy industry debate: at the table Oliver Balch (Chair) Journalist Tom Delay Chief executive, Carbon Trust Clare Hierons Chief Operating Officer, ShareAction Simon Hill Vice president (EMEA), OPower Prof Brian Hoskins Chair, Grantham Institute, Imperial College Joan MacNaughton Executive chair, Energy Trilemma study, World Energy Council Helena Molin Valdés Head of the Secretariat, Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CACC) Simone Mori Head of European affairs, Enel John O’Brien Regional technical adviser on climate change mitigation, United Nations Development Programme Frederik Ottesen Co-founder, Little Sun John Sauven Director, Greenpeace Daniel Zeichner MP for Cambridge, Labour"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/sep/04/goodbye-obama-what-the-novelists-say-tobias-wolff-akhil-sharma-attica-locke-hari-kunzru-jayne-anne-p","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-04T08:00:55Z","webTitle":"The Obama years: novelists assess his legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/goodbye-obama-what-the-novelists-say-tobias-wolff-akhil-sharma-attica-locke-hari-kunzru-jayne-anne-p","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/goodbye-obama-what-the-novelists-say-tobias-wolff-akhil-sharma-attica-locke-hari-kunzru-jayne-anne-p","fields":{"headline":"The Obama years: novelists assess his legacy","bodyText":"Tobias Wolff: ‘The coolness of his style has led to a lack of praise for what he has achieved’ Tobias Wolff is best known for his memoir This Boy’s Life, which won the Los Angeles Times book award for biography. His 1984 novella, The Barracks Thief, won the Pen/Faulkner award for fiction. He was the director of creative writing at Stanford from 2000 to 2002 and received a National Medal of Arts from the president in 2015. Our candidates for president campaign as if they’re running for king, and not just any king – no quaint, hospital-touring symbol of national unity, no mere figurehead answerable to a constitution and a popular assembly. Congress? What’s that? If elected, our American candidate will, like an absolute monarch, resolve the thorniest problems of state simply by exerting his (or her!) will. Is the domestic economy on fire, and about to spread to our neighbours? He will “fix” it, because he “knows how”. Students drowning in debt? He’ll make college free! Islamic jihadists taking over cities in Syria and Iraq? He’ll carpet bomb them until we find out “if sand [and innocent civilians] can glow”. Do suspected terrorists know more than they’re telling? He’ll have them tortured till they sing like Pavarotti, and kill their families into the bargain, and the military will just have to suck it up and do what he says, even if they say they won’t, and have the law to back them up. Law? What’s that? She’ll ban assault weapons; he’ll make sure you can take them to church. The promise of immediate and radical change is a campaign fiction presented with such bald-faced effrontery that we hardly question it any more, unless it’s coming from the other side. Indeed, the performance can’t be sustained unless we support it with our credulity, like a tentful of rubes gaping at the tricks of a carnival magician, even offering ourselves up as subjects. The wishful thinking that is the source of this credulity is, of course, a prelude to disappointment if our candidate actually gets elected. Take the case of candidate Barack Obama. He was going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and close Guantánamo. He would save our failing economy, mend our broken healthcare system, and enact sensible gun control legislation. He would overhaul our immigration system, address climate change with meaningful policies, and change the bilious tone of our political discourse. We weren’t a nation of red states and blue states, he reminded us: we were the United States. Despite my years, I believed – believed not only that he meant what he said, but that he could get it done. My wife and I gathered several friends on a November night in 2008, and watched with joy and disbelief as this young, literary, ironical man with a Kenyan father was elected to the presidency. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I was one. But as time went on those tears began to burn. He wasn’t getting it done, or so it seemed to me. Guantánamo was still in business. The planet kept heating up, and the wars dragged on, though increasingly waged by special forces. As before, just about anybody was free to walk into a gun store and come out armed, and each year some 30,000 Americans continued to pay for that freedom with their lives. And the tone of political life had become even more toxic than before the election. During President Obama’s first State of the Union address, a congressman from South Carolina shouted: “You lie!” and became a Republican hero, even as the leaders of that party dedicated themselves to obstructing President Obama’s legislative initiatives and judicial appointments, effectively disabling the government in order, as the senate majority leader shamelessly admitted, to make Obama a one-term president. The birthers continued to question his legitimacy, and, further, to imply that he was a secret Muslim and supporter of Isis. He was Hitler. He was Lenin. None of this of this was Obama’s fault. Indeed, he reacted to the unrelenting stream of slander and congressional malfeasance with unflappable calm and an air of faintly amused detachment. And for that I did blame him. The coolness I had admired during his campaign became an irritant. In fact, it drove me sort of crazy. Why didn’t he fight back? Show some rage at what was truly outrageous, the obstruction, the name-calling, the attacks on Michelle Obama for encouraging schools to serve healthy food, even for occasionally wearing dresses that showed her arms? Call these liars and bullies out, damn it! Politics is mud wrestling, did he not understand that? And if he really didn’t feel anger, then why not take some acting lessons, and fake it? Well, I was wrong. As Barack Obama prepares to leave office, I think about what he managed to do in the face of implacable resistance. No, he didn’t close Guantánamo; the Republican congress wouldn’t let him, nor would they let him bring sanity to our gun laws, or to our immigration policies. But as most economists agree, his financial initiatives, narrowly approved, did save us from a profound recession, possibly even a depression. His successful auto industry bailout, fiercely contested at the time, saved countless jobs at virtually no expense to the taxpayer. If Obama couldn’t entirely extricate us from the wars he inherited, he has refrained from entangling us in new wars, despite being constantly urged to do so by congressmen and senators who otherwise refuse to spend tax dollars – on, say, education, or roads, or environmental safeguards. Finally, 20 million Americans who did not have health insurance when Barack Obama took office have it now; and in spite of dire Republican predictions, and umpteen votes for repeal, it has actually lowered the healthcare cost inflation rate. No one in this country, however poor, or sick, need be without insurance. This achievement eluded Theodore Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, among others. So why has Obama not been celebrated for what he’s done? Why did so many of us so often feel a sense of impatience, even disappointment? I believe it comes down to immaturity – in us, not him. At least part of the reason for our failure to recognise and praise what he’s accomplished has to do with his style – that coolness. He doesn’t brag, or gloat. He doesn’t call attention to himself, or proclaim his deeds in the thoroughfares, or ridicule those who oppose him. But we wanted him to. We wanted heat. We wanted anger, slashing rhetoric, mockery. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies. We wanted him to wage war, and crow over his fallen enemies. And because we did not get the melodrama we demanded, we lost the plot. But now we have a candidate who will give us all the sound and fury we could ask for, or imagine. Let’s see how we like it. Me, I’m already nostalgic for Obama. Akhil Sharma ‘Now I am much less tolerant of white stupidity’ Akhil Sharma is the author of the 2015 Folio prize-winning novel Family Life as well as An Obedient Father, for which he won the 2001 Hemingway Foundation/PEN award. Born in India, he moved to the US as a child and he is currently an assistant professor of creative writing at Rutgers University-Newark. His short story Cosmopolitan was turned into a 2003 film of the same name. At the Times Square subway stop there is an electronics good store with TVs in the windows. For perhaps the first two years of the Obama presidency, one of the TVs was constantly showing Obama swearing the oath of office. Always there was a small knot of black people standing before the window, looking at the TV tenderly. I am Indian and I have experienced some racism in America but I did not experience Obama’s inauguration or presidency as some great promise coming true. When I saw the knot of black people watching the inauguration, what I felt was embarrassment. I understood the tenderness on the faces as hope. That things would change. To me, it seemed obvious that things would not change. That racism and fear of others getting ahead is so deeply rooted in the white American psyche that there was bound to be a backlash. To me, the tenderness seemed like people believing a lie they desperately wanted to believe. In eight years a person can change quite a bit and, to me now, that tenderness I saw is not hope but joy. There can be joy in the moment and one can be joyful without believing that things will necessarily get much better. To me now, those black people standing before the window were smarter than I was in that they chose to enjoy their happiness. One other way that I have experienced the Obama presidency is that I have begun to be intolerant of certain types of stupidity from white people. My role is no longer to help them become comfortable with racial issues or to help them see another point of view. My response to white stupidity now is to tell people to grow up. I have an acquaintance who was Obama’s boss when Obama had just gotten out of college. My acquaintance, a white man, was deeply irritated that Obama had become president and that he himself had not. I can certainly claim to my share of irrationality but when I heard this, it seemed to me a new level of bizarreness. Before the Obama presidency, if I had heard something so stupid I would have just laughed. Now I asked the man if he would have thought this if Obama had been white? Attica Locke: ‘His healthcare reforms were humongous’ Attica Locke was born in Texas. Her first novel, Black Water Rising, was nominated for a 2010 Edgar award, an NAACP Image award, and a Los Angeles Times book prize. Her second, The Cutting Season, was a national bestseller and winner of the Ernest Gaines award for literature. She is an academy member for the Folio prize UK, as well as being on the board of directors for the Library Foundation of Los Angeles. When Obama was elected, what I felt was bigger than joy – though I’m not sure I have a word for what it was. I remember watching the results on TV and saying over and over: “Is this actually happening? Is this real?” I just couldn’t take it in. I was stunned in my soul. A few months later, I went to stay on a plantation in southern Louisiana, doing research for my second book. I was sleeping in a little cabin right by the field where slaves used to cut sugar cane. One night a storm was coming and you could hear the leaves rustling against each other, and it sounded to me like voices. I remember talking to whatever spirits were out there and telling them: “Your labour was not in vain. Everything you lived for was not in vain.” And I felt a deep sense of hope – hope beyond what was written on an election poster. Has that hope been fulfilled? Not exactly. Don’t get me wrong, there was never a part of me that thought we were going to get a post-racial society. I’m not interested in living in a post-racial society. But I had a hope that we were about to move past the worst of our racial history. Right now, America is at a crossroads. The Obama presidency can move us forward, or we can backslide into racial intolerance and violence for good. One of the effects of Obama being elected is that there is a level of racism in America that can no longer be ignored. If a man like Barack Obama, so well-educated, so graceful, so intelligent, so charming, can be so reviled and denigrated on a daily basis in some parts of the country and in Congress (to the point that he can hardly do his job), you can no longer as a normal American ignore the profound problem of race in this country. There are a lot of well-meaning white folks who for years could not see the breadth of racism in America, so I feel that one of the gifts of Obama’s presidency – a perverse gift – is the fact it allowed a sickness to bubble up to the surface, like a boil on the skin. You can’t treat what you can’t see. And now that we see it, maybe there’s a chance to treat this racial sickness for good. As for my feelings about Obama, the man himself, I think he’s done a lot of positive things. He got dumped with an economy in freefall in 2009 but he’s managed to turn it around. And his healthcare reforms were humongous, as big to me as stuff that Lyndon Johnson did back in the 60s, like creating Medicare. Of course he’s done things that I do not agree with. I have a problem with the failure to close Guantánamo, I have a problem with drone strikes around the world. But you’re never going to like everything that any president does. What I’m not going to do is hold Obama to a higher standard, where he has to be a magical negro who is perfect. He’s allowed to make missteps. I think we’re just beginning to see what this man and his wife together are going to do for the country. He’s done what he can within the office of the presidency, but now I think he could be like Jimmy Carter, who has done some incredible work since leaving office. We’re just seeing the beginning of Obama’s power as a human being. As told to Killian Fox Hari Kunzru: ‘His rhetorical skill soothed the terror induced by his blackness’ British novelist Hari Kunzru left London for New York eight years ago. He was the recipient of the Betty Trask prize (2002) and the Somerset Maugham award (2003) for his debut novel, The Impressionist. His 2011 novel, Gods Without Men, led to the coining of the genre “translit”: novels that “cross history and geography without being historical nor changing psychic place” (New York Times). The clearest legacy of the Obama presidency is symbolic. It’s hard for non-Americans (and, indeed, non-whites) to understand the psychic blow dealt to the nativist right by the ascent of a black man to the White House. That part of the Republican base that abandoned the Democrats after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and which has been so irresponsibly indulged by the party of Lincoln, took the news like medieval villagers witnessing an eclipse. We’ve now spent eight years watching Republican congressmen scurrying hither and thither brandishing pitchforks, outraged at the latest whiff of terrorist fist-bumpery. The obstructionist opposition to Obama came tricked out in 18th-century Founders’ drag, bewigged and buckle-shoed. Ostensibly they were angry that the framers of the constitution were being traduced by a stoner Kenyan community organiser, yet beneath the surface, their grievances often turned out to be rooted in the erosion of the racial deference that has been expected in this country since the days when Jefferson and Washington toured their slave quarters . The presence of a black first family in the White House, the nation’s lifestyle fishbowl, is just as symbolically powerful as the sight of a black husband and father shouldering the responsibilities of the presidency. In their immaculate media presentation, the Obamas have communicated themselves to the readers of the kind of magazines found in supermarket checkouts as a family whose dignity and essential decency are well sheathed in the necessary American armour of glamour. Whoever wins the presidency in November, the first spouse will command a fraction of the respect that Michelle Obama enjoys. The sight of the two Obama daughters, young black women growing up with unlimited aspirations in a loving home, begs a response from a country where the number one cause of death for black women aged 15-34 is homicide by a current or former partner. Many of the young people driving the Black Lives Matter movement came of age during the Obama presidency, their political consciousness formed by the 2008 election. For them, Obama turned out to be more hope than change, and his failure to speak in a full-throated way in their support has felt like a betrayal, but once the thick rind of symbolism has been peeled, the president has always been a cautious centrist Democrat with an instinct for consensus, not a man likely to align himself with the politics of black power. In policy terms, the Obama legacy is mixed. The passing of the Affordable Care Act has curbed some of the more egregious iniquities of the dysfunctional US healthcare system, but hundreds of thousands of Americans still go bankrupt every year because of medical bills. Eight years after the financial crisis, the president has succeeded in keeping the wheels on American capitalism, but once the dust settled, it became clear that the crash accelerated the transfer of wealth from the middle class to the very rich, an injustice he has done nothing to address. Middle Eastern policy has been rudderless. There were, to be honest, no good options available after the squalid disaster of the Bush wars, but Obama’s vacillation about engagement helped produce the chaos in Libya and the vacuum in Syria so ruthlessly exploited by Isis and the Russians. He allowed “red lines” to be crossed without sanction. The drone war, considered in many parts of the world as the administration’s signal moral disaster, has carried on with little serious domestic opposition. The failure to close Guantánamo is, in the scheme of things, the least of these failures. Only time will tell whether the vaunted Iran deal produces a harvest of peace and stability. And yet Obama will be missed. Sometimes, out of his extensive rhetorical tool kit, the president pulls a weird folksy tone, a subliminal suggestion of Merle Haggard, designed, no doubt, to soothe the terror induced by his blackness. Desperate as it is to go on a psychic vacation in the magical kingdom of the “post-racial”, America will discover that it was lucky to have had a figure capable of such virtuosic code-switching, a man who demonstrated that it was possible to communicate across the lines. Jayne Anne Phillips: ‘Just by being who he is he has made an enormous impact’ Guggenheim fellow Jayne Anne Phillips won the 1980 Sue Kaufman prize for first fiction when she was only 26, for her debut book of stories, Black Tickets. Twenty-one years later, her novel MotherKind won the Massachusetts Book award. She is the holder of two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships. Obama has been a transformational president, and this may not become entirely clear until he leaves office. People forget that when he assumed the presidency in 2009, he was handed a financial disaster in the making and his response to it really saved the country, and possibly the world, from financial collapse. But he’s done so much more. In the two years in which he had a Democratic Congress, he passed the Affordable Care Act and oversaw a $36bn dollar expansion in Pell Grants, which very much affects students at Rutgers University-Newark, where I direct the MFA programme. Obama has been a stealth president. He’s had to be: six years of his presidency have been completely obstructed by the Republicans. But he’s managed to change energy policy, improve medical care and academic standards, he changed “don’t ask, don’t tell” in the military and influenced awareness of LGBTQ issues both legally and in popular culture. He went to Cuba, he went to Hiroshima. He has worked hard to fight climate change. Solar energy production has increased 30-fold since he became president. Jobs in the solar industry have grown exponentially, and he’s leading the effort to phase out damaging hydrofluorocarbons used in air conditioning. His presidency has accomplished so much of which citizens are not aware. He has embraced executive actions, unwilling to accept the stasis Congress embodies. Then there’s the whole leadership case. He can’t end racism and sexism in America, but just by being who he is, he’s made an enormous impact. I think he is truly a visionary who is uniquely qualified to serve. He’s a biracial African American man who grew up in a white household. He came from a background of law and community organising. He’s an absolutely wonderful orator: funny, elegant and humane. I suppose it’s clear that I’m a big Obama fan and that this election year has been a psychedelic nightmare. It’s like going from the sublime to – if Trump is actually elected – the ridiculously dangerous. It’s a very strange time in this country and we can only hope that Trump will continue to implode. Hillary Clinton is exceptionally qualified and I think she’d be a good president; American sexism plays a huge part in her supposed “unlikability”. She might not be as inspiring as Obama, she’s not cool or chic, but she is such a policy wonk, so prepared and careful. And constant. Her priorities – children, families, justice – are the same after 30 years. Yet she is suspected because she has breached the establishment. I’m just praying she’ll win. If Trump wins, there’ll be a lot of people in America trying to marry Canadians. Obama has been a inspiring and provocative leader. The fact that this is more or less the consensus around the world really matters, because it means he’s not vulnerable to the sniping and griping, to the ridiculous “go low, no, go lower” tone that Trump has set in this election. I don’t think anything will change the fact that Obama’s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history. He is Trump’s polar opposite. What a country this is, to nurture and succour two such opposite cultural/political beings. The best and the worst have moved further and further apart; we are a completely divided nation. Those paradise moments – the very surprising 2008 Obama election, the crowds, the alliances, the decency, charm and intelligence of it all – exist alongside all that we now endure. It’s a world that only a 24-hour news cycle could love. What will Trump do or say next? Like everything Trump touches, it’s all about him. But I digress. Desperation and chaos are distracting. How dark will it get? Regardless, Obama is not going away. The America that elected him twice is not going away either. Like Elvis, that America has left the building. Hopefully it will reappear on election day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/13/tory-pledge-to-end-wind-subsidies-risks-green-economy-say-industry-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T15:24:40Z","webTitle":"Tory pledge to end wind subsidies risks green economy, say industry leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/13/tory-pledge-to-end-wind-subsidies-risks-green-economy-say-industry-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/13/tory-pledge-to-end-wind-subsidies-risks-green-economy-say-industry-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Tory pledge to end wind subsidies risks green economy, say industry leaders","bodyText":"The Conservatives must not undermine the so-called green economy and cause job losses through their manifesto pledge to end subsidies for onshore windfarms, figures in the renewable energy industry have said. Dale Vince, founder of the green energy company Ecotricity, told the Guardian: “It’s going to be interesting to see what Cameron’s new government does now. I see a bit of a self-made dilemma on green issues: on the one hand, they’ve positioned themselves against renewable energy and green initiatives generally; on the other, they have legally binding carbon reduction targets to hit and have promised real action on climate change. These issues are joined at the hip - you can’t deliver one without the other.” Vince, a major donor to Labour in the run-up to the election, added that the Conservatives would be mistaken to ignore the green economy, which is worth about £128bn a year and employs nearly a million people in renewable power, energy efficiency and other industries. “It makes no economic or business sense to undermine the green economy,” Vince said. “It’s a sector worth £3.5tn globally, and which the UK has a 4% share of – it’s a massive opportunity for our country, for jobs and for industry, and for sustainable economic growth. I’m hoping the cold realities of this will trump the pre-election rhetoric and we’ll be able to get on with the job.” The outcome of the general election was viewed gloomily by most green business leaders contacted by the Guardian. “It’s bloody awful,” one said privately. Jeremy Leggett, founder of the solar energy company Solarcentury, said that rising costs for fossil fuels and the downward trend in the cost of renewable energy would be forces that the government would have to take into account. “I am obviously nervous. But the government faces the same emerging megatrends as the rest of the world: the general energy-incumbency cost-up, and the general energy-insurgency cost-down. Increasingly, it is becoming clear who will win globally. It is all about timing, and who seizes the opportunity and who misses out.” In the short term, some companies may be losers. Victoria Cuming, head of policy at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said that the Tory pledge to end any new public subsidy for onshore wind had “cast a shadow” over the 6.9GW of new projects currently in advanced stages of the planning process. She said the UK market for onshore wind “would not survive a total subsidy cut”, even though onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of energy generation. The effect could last longer than the current parliament, she warned: “A future government could find it very challenging to reverse the impact on the onshore wind industry of such a subsidy stop.” Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK, which represents the wind industry, said: “We urge the new administration to confirm the importance of onshore wind as an essential part of our electricity mix, as it is one of the most cost-effective ways to generate electricity, and is consistently supported by two-thirds of the public. As long as we can continue on our current course, onshore wind will be the cheapest of all power sources by 2020, so it makes sense to support it.” Lloyd Godwin, project engineer at Airvolution, a green energy company, was less sanguine. He said: “I sincerely hope for my career’s sake and that of many of my colleagues that the Conservatives think carefully about the implications of their manifesto pledge to scrap the subsidy for onshore wind and to stop future deployment. “When they look at this in detail, they will realise that onshore wind is popular and it makes sense to deploy the cheapest technology first – onshore wind – rather than other more expensive technologies. Otherwise, it is obvious that consumer bills will go up, and people like me will lose their jobs.” Heather Jones, community liaison officer for REG, which builds and operates onshore wind farms, agreed. “What many people don’t realise is that there is a lot of support for onshore wind farms at a local level.” She added: “There are tens of thousands of skilled British jobs dedicated to delivering the power we require. I hope that the Conservative government will appreciate that if local people want to have the cheapest renewable energy, independent British firms should be allowed to compete to deliver it.” Matthew Spencer, director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said that the prime minister should act fast to shore up the green economy, and the confidence of investors in it. “The next few weeks provide a big opportunity for David Cameron to reclaim environmental stewardship and climate action for British conservatism, after the confusion of the last parliament. It’s his chance to challenge the lazy assumption that these are only issues the centre-left care about, and follow through on the pledges he made before the election to drive ambitious climate action.” However, green businesses and campaigners were cheered by the appointment on Monday of Amber Rudd, one of the few remaining ‘green Tories’, as the new energy and climate secretary. Ben Stafford, head of public affairs at WWF in the UK, said: “[This] is good news. As a minister under the last government she showed that she understands climate change is a huge threat, to the economy, society and the environment, and one that needs to be tackled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2015/mar/13/mobile-charging-phone-boxes-planned-london-solarbox","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-13T18:30:59Z","webTitle":"Need juice?

We’d love to hear your responses to these stories and any others you’ve read recently, both at Guardian Cities and elsewhere: share your thoughts in the comments below. From pay phone to charge phone If you wander the streets of London this year, you might spot a green phone box. The Solarbox project, which debuted in a Tottenham Court Road phone box last year, is planning to transform 10 more now-underused red London icons into something both environmentally friendly and useful for 21st-century urban residents: free hubs for charging mobile phones – using solar energy. As CityLab explains, if the project grows successfully in London, its founders may expand it to cities elsewhere too. Delhi – built by women? Last week was International Women’s Day, and we met some inspiring women shaping the built environment today. Scroll now takes us to Delhi, exploring how two of the city’s most famous buildings – Humayun’s Tomb and Chandni Chowk – were built by women. “Walking through history with our eyes wide open can transform our ideas of respectability and ability,” Uma Asher writes. “What if we walked through our city the same way?” A ferry bad idea New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last month announced his plan to create a citywide ferry service by 2017. The plan includes six new ferry routes connecting 22 stops across the city. But as Henry Grabar writes in Slate, “ferries are a lot more fun than they are useful;” for most New Yorkers, they remain “irrelevant” as a practical transport mode. Grabar discusses the potential problems of the new network: a small projected ridership (would the proposed cable car be more popular?), low employment density along the city’s coastline, administrative obstacles and weather dependence. What’s more, the areas served by the network are mostly gentrified, making it an exclusive form of public transport. Dancefloor regeneration Since its devastating earthquake in 2011, Christchurch has been left with areas of vacant land in the city centre. Bottom-up efforts continue to transform and revitalise these spaces, the most recent of which involves a pop-up dance floor. As Pop-Up City explains, Dance-o-Mat is a mobile dance floor equipped with four speakers and a disco ball, which you can activate with some small change and a playlist. The project is part of a trend of “adaptive urbanism”, celebrated as a grassroots way of engaging communities to design and activate their cities. LA’s growing After planting some carrots on the street outside his house, LA resident Ron Finley helped kickstart a guerrilla gardening movement that has now resulted in the city passing a new law to allow free gardens next to sidewalks so communities can grow their own food. “In some of these neighbourhoods, that’s the only place people have to plant,” explains Finley in Fast Co Exist. “Between the concrete, asphalt, and chain link fences, they don’t have any other places. To me, it’s about making food hyperlocal.” Karl’s American road trip As part of a series in the New York Times Magazine, author Karl Ove Knausgaard continues his “saga”, telling the story of a road trip from Cleveland to Detroit, complete with a visit to his cousin. With arrestingly beautiful photographs from Peter van Agtmael, Knausgaard’s tale takes us through the reflections, discoveries and landscapes of a wintry midwest American journey, laced through with family history and meetings with strangers: Soon we were out on the highway, smoking in our seats as Peter zigzagged slowly between the heavy, slow-moving semitrailers, the cabs of which resembled elaborate little houses. Ever since I landed in Cleveland the previous day, the landscape had been the same, a sort of centerless, semi-urban sprawl of highways, subdivisions, shopping malls, warehouses, gas stations and factories. Time to cool down Last but not least, ever wanted your city’s public spaces to be air-conditioned? Yep, that’s right: outside space, with air conditioning. You might want to move to Doha if so, as the city plans to create the world’s first artificially-cooled outdoor plaza.

Tuesday’s low of $75.84 per barrel was more than 25% below the prices of just this past summer. Oil’s slippery price slope could get even slipperier as winter approaches. It’s simple supply-and-demand economics: a worldwide slowdown in demand for oil, combined with the ongoing expansion of global production, thanks largely to aggressive extraction from US shale-rock formations, has sent the price of crude oil tumbling like a stone. Where the bottom is and when it will be reached, nobody really knows. Goldman Sachs, which last week raised the specter of oil market oversupply in a report, slashed its price forecast for next year to $70 per barrel. Research analysts at the investment bank said they expect prices to recover to $80 per barrel in 2016 and beyond – which would remain well below west Texas prices over the last five years. Consumers can rejoice over this reprieve at the pump – even environmentally conscious consumers, since collapsing prices “will achieve a slowdown in US shale oil production”, wrote Goldman Sachs analysts. Like extraction of natural gas from shale formations, shale oil production also relies on the controversial drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”. Little impact on renewable energy markets But what about renewable energy markets? Will solar, wind and biomass buckle under the pressure of this low-priced petroleum glut? Historically, lower fossil fuel prices have impacted renewable energy resources like kryptonite – for example in the 1980s and 1990s, when nascent solar, wind and geothermal markets in California keeled over as North America suddenly became awash in cheap oil and natural gas. But energy markets dynamics have changed in the 21st century. In fact, when it comes to electricity, oil and renewables hardly mix at all anymore. That’s because diesel and other petroleum-based fuels account for only 5% of global power generation today, according to the International Energy Agency, compared to a full quarter piece of the pie in 1973. Diesel is even less relevant in US power markets, where it makes up only 1% of generation. “As far as solar and wind go, the [impact] from lower oil prices is zero in North America and Europe, where power prices do not have any link to oil,” said Pavel Molchanov, a senior research analyst at Raymond James Financial, in an email. In some emerging markets for wind and solar, however, such as the Middle East and North Africa, and even in a few established markets such as Japan, diesel does still play a bigger role in power supply – but not big enough to matter much considering current renewable energy prices, according to Molchanov. “In the Middle East, and to a lesser extent post-Fukushima Japan, there is some relevance,” he said. But even at prices below today’s forecasts, “solar can compete effectively with diesel-fired generation”. California-based SunPower, which is majority-owned by French oil giant Total SA, agrees. “The price of oil has almost nothing to do with future demand, even in [the Middle East],” Tom Werner, SunPower’s chief executive, told investment analysts during a conference call last week. “We can price solar energy significantly below diesel-produced electricity,” he claimed. “You have to have substantially lower cost of barrel of oil to even come close to the numbers that you can hit with solar.” ‘Sunlight is essentially free’ Marc van Gerven, vice president of global strategic marketing at rival First Solar, said in an email that solar can provide a competitive advantage over diesel, coal or natural gas because fossil-fuel prices, even if low at this moment, have proven to be quite volatile over time. “Fluctuations in oil prices have little impact on solar or many other renewable energy sources. This is partly why the economic proposition of solar is so compelling, unique and valuable,” he said. “For example, up to 50% of the cost of a fossil plant is the expense of the fuel over the life of the plant, while sunlight is essentially free.” A recent energy cost analysis by Lazard not only backs up these views on oil’s diminutive impact on renewables. It goes further in calculating that the cost of energy from new utility-scale solar and wind power plants is increasingly competitive with more relevant conventional electricity fuels like coal, natural gas and nuclear power, even without subsidies in some markets. One reason for this, the firm found, is that the average long-term cost of large-scale solar energy, for example, has dropped 20% just in the past year and nearly 80% in the last five years. Land-based wind energy costs have fallen by 15% in the last year, and by 60% in the past five years.

Print your own apartment A construction firm from Shanghai has unveiled what they are calling “the world’s tallest 3D-printed building”: a five-storey apartment building made using a 3D printer. The building is on display at the Suzhou Industrial Park, alongside a 3D-printed neoclassical mansion. As CityLab explains, the buildings are created with a patented “ink” consisting of recycled construction waste, which is then coursed through a printer that is 150 metres long. Could printing our homes be a realistic solution to the housing crises facing cities around the world? High Line ‘em up It feels now as if every month, another “High Line” project is proposed in cities wishing to emulate the success of the original park in New York. CityMetric rounds up the ideas and attempts – from the Peckham Coal Line in London to São Paulo’s transformed “Minhocão” motorway and an elevated pedestrian park in Seoul. The ideal desert city Italian architect Luca Curci has come up with a proposal for a fully self-sufficient city located in a desert. As Fast Co Exist explains, the design of the city means its residents share all of the resources, from renewable energy to recycled wastewater. The city consists of a network of circular buildings, powered by solar energy and cooled by wind-harvesting devices. Other features include shared electric cars and drinking water provided through desalination. However, the design is still very much hypothetical. “This is a project proposal for a new way to live in the desert,” Curci explains. “There are many ways to save and reuse available resources.” Safe cities The Economist Intelligence Unit has published a report on safety in cities – The Safe Cities Index 2015 – which has scored cities across four categories: digital security; health security; infrastructure safety; and personal safety. An infographic of the key findings shows that Tokyo and Singapore rate as the safest cities in the world. But is safety the most important ingredient of city life? With all its rules and restrictions, Singapore doesn’t necessarily sound like the most enjoyable place to live ... Photographing Berlin Berlin is a city that demands to be photographed – and that’s just what Thorsten Klapsch has done for the last 25 years. Uncube magazine have published an interview with Klapsch alongside a gallery of his brilliant images, discussing the process of documenting the city during a period of unique change. “The division of Berlin has left strong marks on the cityscape,” Klapsch explains; “the socialist thinking behind Alexanderplatz and its vicinity is still clearly visible. The post-war drive towards new and modern types of housing has also left formative buildings in both former East and West: such as the Stalinist buildings in Karl-Marx-Allee and those in the Hansaviertel in the Tiergarten.” For more photography from the city, check out our gallery of Ciarán Fahey’s photographs of Blub, an abandoned swimming pool complex in West Berlin.

It was the middle of a central Indian summer afternoon, and outside, the temperature had hit 45C. Up in the cab, 15 metres above the black, shiny ground, it was comfortable, air-conditioned. The driver tipped the steel-toothed rim of the shovel’s bucket downwards, then slammed it into the coal seam wall in front of him. A few hours earlier, a drilling rig mounted on caterpillar tracks had drilled deep holes into the coal from the flat ground above, and filled them with explosives. Their detonation broke the coal into diggable chunks, some of them pebbles, others a metre across. The seam being worked was 20 metres thick, and lay some 300 metres beneath what was once the ground’s surface – the deeper of two black stripes of coal. Overlying the seams, until it was blasted and dug away, were much larger quantities of grey-brown shale, what miners call “overburden”. Having been stripped from the coal, it lay stacked up in mountainous piles on either side of the mine, the walls of an artificial Grand Canyon. The surface area of this mine, Dudhichua, is 16 square kilometres. In the year ending March 2015, Dudhichua produced 15m tonnes of coal – more than the UK’s entire remaining production. But it is only one of 16 mines in the Singrauli coalfield, which spans parts of two districts in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. All but one are owned by the state-run Northern Coalfields Ltd, a subsidiary of Coal India, one of the country’s biggest firms. As is the case with other Indian coalfields, Singrauli is home to numerous coal-fired thermal electricity plants, some almost on the doorstep of the mines. Their current aggregate capacity is about 20 gigawatts, nearly 10% of India’s total national generating capacity. (By comparison, peak electricity demand for the entire UK is only 57GW.) Singrauli may be one of India’s biggest energy hubs, but it is also isolated. Apart from the mines and power stations, the coalfield is home to a handful of towns, poverty-stricken villages and some prosperous corporate “colonies”, with their own schools, sports fields and clinics. To visit the area involves a 220km drive from the nearest airport at Varanasi, on a chaotic road that often lacks a proper surface: the journey can easily take eight hours. Phone signals and internet are intermittent. The only communications that really work are the high-voltage power lines that carry Singrauli’s output to the teeming cities of northern India’s plains. Last year, the coalfield’s total production was about 87m tonnes. (When the British coal industry began to decline with the outbreak of the 1984 miners’ strike, it was producing about 130m tonnes annually.) Singrauli’s significance – and that of the subcontinent’s many other coalfields, which span the length and breadth of India, with further large reserves in Pakistan – extends globally. In 2013, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that in order to restrict the increase of world average temperatures to 2C above pre-industrial times, the world must adopt a strict “carbon budget” for emissions. According to the IPCC, the current rate of fossil fuel burning will exhaust this within 25 years, after which fuels must either be left unexploited, or have their emissions kept from the atmosphere by carbon capture and storage. India has the world’s fifth-largest coal reserves – and very few cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas. Its leaders are also determined to spread the benefits of economic development more widely among its population of almost 1.3bn people – one third of whom still have no access to electricity. Anil Swarup, the permanent secretary at the coal ministry in Delhi, said in an interview that last year Indian production from both private and state-owned mines was 620m tonnes, more than 85% of it from open-cast workings. A further 400m tonnes were imported. At Singrauli and elsewhere, he added, production is set to increase rapidly, with strong encouragement from the rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which swept to power last year. Modi is determined to restore the sustained GDP growth rate of 8-10% that India enjoyed for a decade until 2011. “We are looking to double Indian coal production by 2020,” Swarup said, “and to reduce reliance on imports.” Beyond that date, he said production would continue to rise to 1.5bn tonnes a year, with most of this being burnt in coal-fired power plants. In the past six months, the government has given environmental clearance to 41 new mining projects. The consequence, Swarup said, is that from now until 2020, “a new mine will be opened every month. You have to work on the assumption of requirement, and in India, there is a need for power.” Last August, the Indian supreme court ruled that more than 200 mining licences awarded by governments before 2010 were illegal, forcing the cancellation of numerous planned projects. The system that its judgment set aside had already been shown to be rife with corruption. The most prominent casualty of India’s “Coalgate” scandal was the former Congress prime minister Manmohan Singh, who last month came close to criminal indictment. Enshrined in a law enacted by Modi’s government is a new scheme under which coal blocks are auctioned to the highest bidder. It hugely incentivises state governments to foster new mines. According to Swarup, the auctions of the 209 blocks that have been sold off to date have raised about £17bn – money that will swell state coffers for the next 30 years: “This will change the states’ economies. They were really strapped for money. Now they will get it.” Many of the richest untapped reserves lie in heavily forested areas, some near Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, but mainly in Chattisgarh and Jharkand in central India. There, those whose land will be subject to “acquisition” are some of India’s poorest inhabitants, many of them Adivasis – members of indigenous tribes. Swarup insisted that preserving the environment was a high priority for those overseeing India’s new coal boom. “Seeing how the environment can be maintained is a crucial part of this. Whenever I talk to my officers, I say the environment is non-negotiable. But there is no viable alternative to developing more coal. Energy requirements have to be met.” * * * To many western environmentalists, who are determined to see a binding global deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year, India’s rising coal use is anathema. However, across a broad range of Delhi politicians and policymakers there is near unanimity. There is, they say, simply no possibility that at this stage in its development India will agree to any form of emissions cap, let alone a cut. Even a pledge of the kind made by China’s leader Xi Jinping after talks with US president Barack Obama last year, that Chinese emissions would rise to a peak in 2030 and thereafter decline, would be out of the question. This issue – the balance between the environment and growth – arises in every developing country. But India’s sheer size means that its resolution is of exceptional significance. Modi has spoken repeatedly of India’s “right to growth”. Prakash Javadekar, the cabinet minister responsible for the environment, forests and climate change, enlarged on this in blunt terms, speaking in his office at the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India’s parliament: “Our emissions will grow because we are not developed and we have a right, every person on this Earth has a right, to develop. If today the world is 0.8C warmer [than it was in pre-industrial times], it is not my fault. It is the historical responsibility of those who started emitting with the industrial revolution.” (However, largely because of its sheer size and population, India is one of the ten biggest historical emitters, having contributed around 7% to the warming the world has seen so far, compared to 20% for the US and 5% for the UK.) He cited a Hindi political slogan, taken up by the BJP in its struggle to eclipse the once-impregnable Congress Party: “Singhasan khali karo ki janata aati hai,” which roughly means “Vacate the throne, the people are coming.” In Javadekar’s view, for now and for years to come, responsibility for reducing global emissions must be borne by the west: “They must vacate the carbon space because we are coming. We are developing.” Underlying that insistence are some brutal facts. India is famously the world’s largest democracy, and is often said to possess the world’s biggest “middle class”. But in India this term has a meaning very different to its usage in the west. Navroz Dubash, the head of the climate initiative at Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, pointed out that among the richest 10% of Indians, a third live in households which have no refrigerators. In the next richest 10%, only 45% have refrigerators, and in the 10% after that, only 28%. At the mid-point of India’s income distribution, the proportion of fridge owners is just 10%. Dubash, a lead author of the IPCC’s reports, is personally in no doubt as to the need to reduce global emissions. But he said that the limited reach of refrigerators – which India’s climate would seem to make indispensable – “tells you scary things. If you ask people with that level of access to energy to tighten their belts, that’s a very big ask. It means that emissions inevitably have to grow.” In India, he added, the number of people who consume as much energy as anyone deemed to be above the official poverty line in the developed world is, at most, a few tens of millions. Everyone else consumes less. “From a global perspective, you have to give India carbon headroom.” Dubash is the principal author of a recent report that examines seven separate projections of India’s future energy needs and likely emissions. All of them – from institutions including government departments, the World Bank and TERI, the Energy and Resources Institute headed until recently by Raj Pachauri, the former IPCC chairman – state that both coal-fired power and Indian greenhouse gas emissions are set to increase substantially. “By 2030, coal use is projected … to be 2.5-three times current levels,” the report says. Even with stringent policy action to increase the deployment of renewables and increase energy efficiency, “coal use is projected by all but one study to be more than two times current levels”. (Although India has a small nuclear industry – which provides less than 5% of its electricity – attempts to expand it have met strong political resistance. Any new nuclear capacity would take years to build and bring online, so it cannot be expected to fill the country’s energy needs any time soon.) The consequence is that if, as the projections suggest, India’s emissions grow between two and three times by 2030, “India could be the second largest global emitter within the next decade.” Its projected output – between 4bn and 5.7bn tonnes of carbon dioxide each year – will surpass that of the US, which in 2011 was 5.3bn tonnes and falling, and be smaller only than China’s. India’s population is set to outstrip China’s by 2028. But while its total emissions will be high, they will be nowhere near as great, on a per capita basis, as those of more developed countries. The Xi–Obama deal was based on the notion that by 2030, the two nations will reach per capita emissions “convergence”, with each person responsible for producing 14 tonnes of carbon each year. By that date, Prakash Javadekar said, the figure for the average Indian will be just 4 tonnes, a little over twice as much as today: “India will never reach the Chinese-American convergence point. Every climate action has a cost, but I can’t tax my poor.” Even in 2030, Indian per capita emissions are expected to remain below the current world average. Dubash’s report regards all the projections as flawed: they tend to assume sustained high GDP growth, which may not be achievable, and there is a wide divergence between them. “We don’t have a very solid set of analytical inputs, and the projections are not robust,” Dubash said. For that reason alone, “stringent pledges would be unwise, because there is too much uncertainty”. Similar opinions can be found in Delhi among people of very different political stripes. There are a few dissenters, such as Greenpeace India – which led a campaign by local people to resist the development of a new mine in Singrauli that was finally cancelled last year. Since then, the government has taken steps to curb its activities, freezing all its bank accounts on the grounds that it received donations from abroad. But Greenpeace remains on the margins of India’s debate. According to Barun Mitra, the director of the Liberty Institute, a free-market think tank, “in a country where a third of the population doesn’t have electricity, binding emissions limits are a fairy tale”. Nitin Desai is a retired UN diplomat, who organised the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and later represented the UN secretary-general at international climate conferences. He is now a member of a small expert panel advising Modi in the lead-up to Paris. “In a country with blackouts and so many people without access to electricity, can I really manage without developing more coal?” he asked. “Why should we be accountable? The pressure should be on the countries whose per capita emissions are much higher. If you try to force India to adopt emissions targets, you will fail.” The last time US and European leaders made a serious push for a binding global deal, at the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen, India’s delegation was led by Jairam Ramesh, who did Javedekar’s job in the then-Congress-led government. As a minister, he was mercilessly attacked for holding up development on environmental grounds. He said: “The idea that India can set targets in Paris is completely ridiculous and unrealistic. It will not happen. This is a difficult concept for eco-fundamentalists, and I say this as a guy who is considered in India to be very green.” Copenhagen, he said, failed because of what he termed “climate evangelism. I was sitting for days with Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband, Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and Sarkozy. It was absolutely bizarre. It failed because of an excess of evangelical zeal, of which Brown was the chief proponent. It should not happen again.” He added: “Even with the most aggressive strategy on nuclear, wind, hydro and solar, coal will still provide 55% of electricity consumption by 2030, which means coal consumption will be 2.5 or three times higher than at present. Mining and burning coal imposes huge environmental burdens. It’s a double whammy: the more coal we extract, the more forest we lose, and that too will add to global warming.” Nevertheless, he concluded, “I don’t see any alternative other than at least to double India’s coal consumption in the next 15 years.” * * * In Singrauli, the “environmental burdens” imposed by mining and burning coal are not difficult to spot. Some of the area’s power stations date back to the 1970s, and their chimneys, which are almost 300m high, belch great plumes of thick, oily smoke. Coal power station chimneys are supposed to be fitted with electrostatic precipitators, devices to stop ash being emitted into the atmosphere. But Singrauli coal’s ash content is high, up to 40%, and the people who live in the shadow of the older plants say houses, vehicles and other exposed surfaces will often be coated in a thick, grey film. “No one dries their washing outside round here,” said Dr KK Aggarwal, who runs a clinic in the town of Anpara, the site of four big plants, two of them old and two extremely new – the newest, Anpara D, began to come on stream this month. “Many of my patients suffer from respiratory problems, such as asthma, nasal conditions, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are also skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis.” He is convinced the incidence of such conditions is higher than it should be because of the mines and power plants. “Pollution is everywhere.” Some of Singrauli’s mine and power plant operators have already taken elaborate steps to reduce discharges into the air and water. Gigantic water sprayers and closed conveyor belts carrying coal from mine to power station keep dust to a minimum. The chimneys at the newest stations, Anpara C and D, and the nearby “super critical” plant run by the private firm Reliance, India’s biggest company, emit no visible smoke at all – and use only three-quarters as much coal as older stations. Elsewhere, however, the noxious odour of coal dust hangs in the air, and after a few minutes outside, one senses gritty particles in the recesses of one’s mouth and throat. Some of the mines still ship their coal in open trucks, coating roadside trees, ground and buildings in layers of black grime. One of the worst places is the huge yard on the outskirts of Singrauli town, where loads are transferred from the trucks to railway wagons. At the yard entrance there’s a mini-roundabout, adorned with a seven-metre sculpture of a clenched fist, a monument to India’s trade unions. The fist, once red, is stained the deepest black. Since 2010, the Indian government has designated Singrauli a “critically polluted area”. In 2012, Delhi’s prestigious Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) tested Singrauli’s water supplies, along with fish from local reservoirs, human blood and hair samples. In all, the study found high levels of mercury: in one village, water from pumps contained 26 times the maximum safe limit laid down by the Bureau of Indian Standards. Some of the hair samples had five times the “safe” concentration, while the fish contained twice the recommended level. The CSE study also found high incidences of vitiligo, shivers, impaired vision, and burning sensation in the limbs, all recognised effects of mercury. Continued exposure, the study reported, might lead to depression, memory loss, and kidney damage. Chandra Bushan, the CSE’s deputy director and one of the study’s authors, told me the source of the mercury was evident: “fly ash” from Singrauli’s power plants. Fly ash has its uses – for example, in making cement. But for decades, untold thousands of tonnes have been collected from the chimneys, mixed with water and then discharged into the Singrauli environment in the form of grey slurry, left to dry and blow about in vast, open air “ash decks”. Filthiest of all is the treatment of ash from Anpara A, commissioned in 1987, and Anpara B, which began to generate power seven years later. From the plants, a row of pipes carries the slurry to a series of huge ponds, where the ash is supposed to settle out. But the system does not work. From the third and final pond, the milky, polluted liquid tumbles over a grey cascade into the Rihand reservoir, the source of drinking water for the entire Singrauli region. Where the slurry meets the blue reservoir waters, there is a clear and visible boundary. Once the ash is in the reservoir, there is no way to get rid of it. In one of the ponds, Ram Pri, a landless Adivasi, was up to his waist in liquid muck, sieving out the ash in order to decant it into 33kg bags, which are used to make cement. He said he gets paid Rs50 – about 50p – per bag, and by this perilous, toxic labour, can make Rs200–300 a day. His wife used to help him, “but she can’t any longer: her feet, her knees and ankles are all swollen. She’s not able to walk. Maybe that’s because of what’s in the water.” His is not the only local family to have derived little benefit from the Singrauli coal and power boom. For more than 20 years, several thousand mainly Adivasi people have been living in Simplex, a concrete shanty town adjoining the perimeter wall of the 4.7GW Vindhyachal power plant – one of the biggest in India. The colony was built to house workers who built the plant’s early phases, and its high-voltage output lines run directly overhead. Astonishingly, Simplex is still not connected to the electricity grid. Its first “reverse osmosis” water treatment unit opened only eight months ago. Until then, said Anjani Kumar Chaubey, a local activist, “we used to get severe gastric problems. The water we took from our handpumps made your skin sting, and in the monsoon, it contained worms. The whole of India gets electricity from this plant, but we are like the darkness around a candle. How can our children study? Sometimes, when there is a lot of wind, the whole area gets covered with ash. A lot of our people get sick.” In Chilkantanbasti, where 7,000 people live close to a 35-year old coal plant at Shaktinagar, run by the state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation, there is electricity. But the air is some of the region’s dirtiest: “A man gets up here in the morning and he eats coal dust,” said Umar Kand, 19. “He goes to bed at night, and he’s eating coal dust still. If you put anything out anything out round here, it will have a film of ash within an hour.” The streets stink also of sewage: there is no sanitation, and despite a promise by NTPC two years ago, no water treatment unit. There are three public toilets, but none of them work. Kand shrugged: “We go in the forest.” Chilkatanbasti is exposed to another hazard. There are now strict rules governing the landscaping and afforestation of mine overburden piles, which must be split into tiers and divided by broad, flat “benches”, with no slope steeper than 37 degrees. When a giant pile from the Kharia mine that looms over the village was created, these rules did not exist, and the result is a tottering brown mountain, its slopes strewn with boulders the size of cars, its surface deeply etched by the water channels that form each monsoon. “When it rains, material comes down towards us,” said Renu, a local woman who preferred not to give her surname. “The police have even come to tell us we should evacuate our houses in case it slips. I’ve seen the rocks falling down the slopes. If it ever went altogether, it would be like a tsunami. But how can we leave our homes?” * * * Speaking to Time magazine earlier this month, Prime Minister Modi failed to answer a question as to whether India would agree any binding emissions curb in Paris. Instead, he waxed lyrical about Indians’ love for nature, a theme echoed by environment minister Javadekar, who insisted: “Growth and environmental protection are not against each other. We want a clean India, a green India. Clean air is our birthright” – a statement that any visitor to Delhi, which currently endures the world’s worst particulate air pollution, will appreciate. Yet these may not be empty words. For among the BJP government’s most ambitious acts has been to quintuple the 2022 targets set for non-fossil energy by the previous regime, to 175GW – almost six times its current level. The most ambitious target of all is that for solar energy, which is meant to rise from just 3GW now to 100GW, in only seven years. No country has ever built solar at anything approaching this pace, and it would leave India with three times as much solar capacity as Germany – which over the course of decades, has deployed 38.5GW, much more than anywhere else in Europe, and more than twice as much as the United States. Many people, Dubash said, regard the target as “aspirational”: the sheer manufacturing requirement, likely to come at first mainly from China, is huge. On the other hand, for very obvious reasons, photovoltaic solar energy is a much more viable proposition in India than it is in northern European countries such as Germany, or for that matter, Britain. A well-sited solar panel in India will produce energy up to 22% of the time, as against perhaps 8% in the UK. Ratul Puri, chairman of Hindustan Powerprojects Ltd, a multibillion-pound company that has invested heavily in both coal and solar, pointed out that solar has a further local advantage: “Solar generation perfectly overlays the demand cycle.” In other words, the hot, dry and sunny months will see solar output peak, just as the demand for irrigation pumps, fans and air conditioning is also at its greatest. During the cooling monsoon, solar output plummets, but so does demand: there is no need for irrigation when it’s pouring with rain. “Can we have 100% of energy in India from solar?” Puri asked. “No, because I still want to be able to turn on my lights at 9pm at night, when solar is generating nothing. But 15, 20% of our energy coming from solar: we can easily do this in the very near future.” Even in fertile, intensely farmed states such as Punjab, 15% of the land is arid, and unsuitable for irrigation – but ideal for solar panels. Meanwhile, in distinct contrast to Germany or Britain, the levelised cost of solar energy per 1KW/hr unit, averaged out over 25 years, is already close to “grid parity”, simply because Indian solar panels are so much more productive. Government subsidies have in the past been provided for small-scale users – though these were recently cut, from 30% to 15% of installation costs, while only 15% those who deployed solar panels ever claimed them anyway. In India, even without subsidy, solar is becoming competitive with electricity from coal. According to Puri, the price of solar electricity has fallen from Rs13 to Rs6.5 per 1KW/hr unit over the past five years – very close to the Rs6 cost of thermal power from coal. However, recent reforms to the finance of long-term infrastructure debt are reducing the gap still further. Puri added: “Everyone expects interest rates [currently a ruinous 10- 12%] to come down. If that happens, solar is going to hit grid parity, irrespective of any technical discoveries, within the next two years.” In the past five years, Puri’s balance sheet has been split, two to one, in favour of coal over renewables. He said that over the next five years, he intends to reverse that balance, with £1bn going to coal and close to £3bn to solar – making Hindustan Powerprojects easily India’s biggest renewables investor. Behind that decision is the fact that during the growth slowdown after 2011, very few new coal power plants were commissioned, while most of the private power firms which have come to dominate the industry are financially “distressed”. The reasons are complex. They partly stem from the chaotic and indebted state of the “discoms”, or distribution companies, the middlemen in India’s electricity industry, which buy power from generators and sell it to consumers. Artificially low tariffs imposed by state governments mean that discoms deliberately restrict supply, preferring to make power cuts than to increase their losses by selling power at prices below its purchase cost. There has also been a widespread failure to take action against rampant electricity theft in informal urban settlements. The upshot is that most coal plants are operating at only 60% capacity – for the time being, there is a surprising degree of slack in the system. But Puri said that if the economy “does start to roar again” in the way that Modi intends, the country will face a serious power shortfall by 2017. Even if new coal plants started to be planned today, they would not avert this problem: it usually takes seven-to-10 years for a freshly conceived coal plant to become operational. On the other hand, solar projects can typically be realised within 12 to 18 months. “The inactivity in commissioning new thermal plants over the last three years leaves India no choice but to go out and build solar capacity. That means India can overcome the crisis of electricity shortages, have cleaner air, have a more stable grid and go say nice things at the climate change negotiations in Paris.” Without storage technology far in advance of what exists today, coal will still have to provide India’s “baseload”: lights and air conditioning at night; power for the factories Modi wants to see built. But beyond 2030, anything is possible. “I think the entire energy landscape is going to change in the next 30 years,” Puri said. “Storage is going to revolutionise it. I also think solar energy will become much cheaper than coal. So why would you build a coal thermal plant?” There are other solar niches. The unreliability of India’s grid power means the country possesses a staggering 80GW of expensive, off-grid, liquid-fuel generating capacity, most from highly polluting diesel generators. Typically, consumers pay about Rs18 per unit for it when their grid power goes off – three times the usual price. In Noida, a burgeoning satellite city on the outskirts of the Delhi megalopolis, Kushagara Nandan runs Sunsource Energy, a solar start-up. Educated in the US, he cut his teeth on a similar outfit based in New Jersey. Last year, Sunsource revenues quintupled, to £6m. Part of his business is supplying rooftop units which, when the sun is shining, can fill the gap caused by grid outages far more cheaply than diesel: “We synchronise grid, diesel and solar together. In Delhi alone, the potential for rooftop solar is at least 1.5GW.” One of his projects, rated at 250KW, adorns the Habitat Centre, a complex that includes conference venues, auditoria, restaurants and art galleries. Another 500KW array has allowed a school to save 20% on its power bills. Cheap, off-grid solar also has great potential in India’s vast rural hinterland. Last year, a solar project to desalinate briny ground water from wells and power irrigation pumps at a village in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, which Sunsource helped develop with an Indian NGO, was given a Google Global Impact Challenge award. It worked so well that it has now been rolled out in five different villages. * * * Like Ratul Puri, Nandan is a businessman. He is in solar primarily to make money. He urged caution: “Unrealistic expectations must not be raised. It’s crucial to realise that solar must be part of the mix – it cannot substitute for other sources. For the foreseeable future, India doesn’t have a choice between coal and solar. It needs both.” Pragmatism of this kind of now characterises other parts of Indian discourse over energy and the environment. There is, for example, little dispute that the pollution caused in earlier phases of mining and power generation at Singrauli is unacceptable. “There’s about 80GW – 40% of India’s capacity – that is either in such disrepair or so dirty that it needs to be replaced,” said Puri. “The open trucks transporting coal and so on are a short-term phenomenon. No one in their right mind would transport coal by truck.” For the past two years, Ashwani Dubey, a Delhi lawyer who was brought up in Singrauli, has been fighting a case to force the mine and power plant operators to clean up their act in the National Green Tribunal, a powerful judicial body that rules on environmental matters. In written evidence to the court issued in March, India’s Central Pollution Control Board recommended stringent measures, including the end of ash discharge into the Rihand reservoir by 31 July, and much stricter monitoring of air and water quality. Where necessary, remedial measures should be taken within six months – to be funded on the “polluter pays principle”. Within a few months, the open coal trucks are supposed to be gone – replaced by a closed “merry-go-round” railway linking mines to power plants. Northern Coalfields now has an environmental team in Singrauli, led by BK Sharma. As parts of the mines are worked out, it “back-fills” the overburden in an effort restore the landscape, and replants native species: “We are trying to recreate the forest, so that when we leave, it will merge into the ecology of the area,” Sharma said. It sounds utopian. But trees in central India grow fast, and on a visit to what was a part of the Nigahi mine, it was hard to distinguish between remediated pit and original forest. Meanwhile, following a Green Tribunal order, nine village water treatment units have been installed this year. By the end of June, a further 15 are meant to be operational. There are further developments at the national level. Under the new mining law, a third of the money raised by the mining royalty – a 15% levy on all mine revenue, payable to state governments – must be given to communities in mine-affected areas, to be spent as they determine. The details have yet to be worked out. But according to Chandra Bushan of the Centre for Science and Environment, “this is a revolutionary development with huge implications for the entire developing world”. It is to be applied immediately, to old mines and new, and should mean the “darkness around the candle” seen in places such as Simplex will end. “Singrauli could become one of the richest districts in the country,” said Bushan. “Now we must make sure the money is spent on the right things.” Meanwhile, the government has just introduced new pollution standards for coal plant technology – as strict as any in the world. “You will no longer be able to burn coal cheaply and pollute,” said Bushan. Under these rules, old plants such as Shaktinagar and Anpara A will have to be scrapped. Bushan warned that better regulations would not necessarily be enforced. “The arm of the law is not always long in India. But there are certain trends that are positive. I am impressed quite frankly with the Modi government on these issues. They’ve done more than I expected.” Where does all this leave India in the run-up to Paris? According to Navroz Dubash, what India and other developing countries need are not rigid emissions targets, but programmes designed to “bend the curve” – to make emissions lower in the five years after 2020 than they would have been otherwise. The changing format of UN climate negotiations makes this easier to achieve. The diplomatic focus now is not on emissions targets but what are termed INDCs – each country’s “intended nationally determined contribution”. These, Dubash said, “provide an opportunity to dissolve the barrier between development and climate needs”. Measures Dubash would like to see in India’s INDC include its targets for solar energy, better building standards, shifting freight from road to rail, low-energy ceiling fans, and widespread use of LEDs. Most are already in the pipeline: Javadekar said India is about to announce a massive plan to replace city street lights with low-energy LEDs. That approach may allow India to plot the delicate course between environmental and developmental needs. “As an old UN hand, I must tell you that we only distinguish between success and outstanding success,” Nitin Desai joked. “2015 will be a success. The issue is how great it will be.” • Follow the Guardian Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/aug/18/solar-systems-blackout-nepal-hospital-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-18T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Rent to own solar systems hope to prevent blackouts in Nepal’s hospitals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/18/solar-systems-blackout-nepal-hospital-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/18/solar-systems-blackout-nepal-hospital-energy","fields":{"headline":"Rent to own solar systems hope to prevent blackouts in Nepal’s hospitals","bodyText":"Imagine giving birth at night and the lights in the hospital suddenly go out. Or, worse, picture yourself struggling for life on an oxygen machine, only for the hospital to face a power blackout. Such scenarios are part of every day life in Nepal’s rural areas, where daily power cuts can easily last nine hours or more, according to Andy Moon, co-founder of SunFarmer, a development-oriented solar energy provider. “Nepal has over 6,000 health clinics and hospitals, and every single one of them has problems with energy”, says 29-year-old Stanford economics graduate Moon, who previously worked for McKinsey Consulting and US solar energy firm, SunEdison. Together with former SunEdison colleague Jason Gray, Moon set up SunFarmer last year with the goal of enabling health facilities to “rent-to-own” affordable solar systems. The organisation’s funding model sees the up-front installation costs split 80% to 20% between SunFarmer and the local health facility. The health clinic or hospital then pays SunFarmer back in monthly instalments over an eight year-period. The solar provider has committed to plough all profits back into financing future solar energy systems. Interest on the repayments is “nominal” when the loan is in US dollars, and adjusted for inflation when in local currency. The solar start-up installed its first renewably-powered electricity systems in six health clinics in western Nepal last month. Each system costs between $8,000 and $9,000 and has a generating capacity of roughly 1.6 kilowatts. As a result, the participating health facilities are able to reduce their reliance on diesel-powered generators, which are expensive to run and damaging to the environment. “Our systems will provide power for more than just lights. We can provide power for laptops and cell phone charging, but also for medical equipment such as oxygen machines, suction machines, nebulisers and vaccine machines”, Moon states. SunFarmer hopes to install up to 20 new systems by early next year and over 250 around the world within the next five years. It is currently looking to raise a $5m fund – 25% of which is already banked. The solar provider’s early investors include Canadian social impact investment group MaRS and SunEdison’s charitable foundation. A two-month campaign on crowdfunding site Indiegogo saw it raise $25,000 earlier this year. “We’re not just a financing provider”, Moon insists. “We oversee the complete design and installation of the system to make sure the system is installed with all the right components.” The repayment approach gives SunFarmer an added incentive to ensure that the systems remain in good working order, he adds. The company has installed monitoring equipment that allows its engineers in Kathmandu to evaluate the power output of each system in real time. “If there’s any problem, we can send people out there to fix it”, says Moon. The ‘rent-to-own’ model differs from traditional philanthropic approaches, which see solar equipment donated but then either poorly installed or badly maintained. The result is “a lot of broken solar systems” across the developing world, Moon notes. SunFarmer is also working to build the sustainability of Nepal’s nascent solar industry by establishing cooperation partnerships with domestic solar providers. “We want to enable the local solar ecosystem, so we partner with three local solar companies. Instead of competing against them, we provide financing and the technical assistance … to enable them to install bigger systems that they weren’t able to do before”, says Moon. SunFarmer also works with the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), a Nepalese government-led institution that channels funding for renewable projects from international donors. AEPC’s backers include the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, UNDP and the UK development agency DFID, among others. While Moon maintains that solar is the “perfect solution” for Nepal’s remote areas, many of which remain off-grid entirely, he admits that local skill shortages represent a challenge. “It [installing solar power systems] requires the right design, the right technology and people that really have the right experience. What we found is that there’s really very little of this expertise in the world, so that’s what we’re building right now”, he says. Theoretically, there’s nothing to stop SunFarmer’s solar financing and maintenance model being applied to non-health sectors, such as schools, government buildings and other facilities providing core public service facilities. For the moment, however, the solar entrepreneur plans to remain focused on hospitals and clinics. Since the solar electricity was installed in the first six clinics, ten babies have already been born during the night. Before, it was commonplace for the midwives to work holding a torch between their teeth. Now, all ten mothers were attended to by medical team working with the benefit of artificial illumination powered by the sun. “That’s a huge transformation for the clinics, each of which delivers between 60 to 100 babies every year”, says Moon.

Lots of heat. This heat takes energy out of the chemicals (say petrol, coal or gas) and releases it, leaving behind very low energy molecules, like CO2. A chemist's dream is to find efficient ways of putting this energy back into the carbon dioxide to turn it into something else useful. In other words, to convert a waste product that causes global warming into something useful. If carbon dioxide is in a product that will keep it locked up for a long period of time, like furniture or building insulation, this is a way of removing it from the air: carbon capture. And CO2 is free or, given policies to make the emission of carbon dioxide a cost to business, it even becomes a starting material for chemistry that has a negative cost. Luckily, nature already does what chemists aspire to. It efficiently takes carbon dioxide from the air, using energy from sunlight and natural catalysts, and converts it into the carbon building blocks of plants and trees: photosynthesis. Given the intense international focus on greenhouse gases over the past decade, it is unsurprising that many chemists are trying to find routes to useful products. The challenge, as with much of chemistry, is to find synthetic catalysts that speed up reactions in a way that is as good as nature or better. Liquid Light, a spinout from Princeton University, uses electricity and catalysts (what they are is a secret), to make chemicals from carbon dioxide, and seems to have progressed to having a near-commercial process to make ethylene glycol, a key component of anti-freeze and, more interestingly, a building block of polyester bottles and fibres. Scientists at Liquid Light believe they can tailor their catalysts to make other chemicals, and that the electricity used can come from solar panels. The company takes photosynthesis-level efficiency as the benchmark against which to measure their process, and claims it is now twice as efficient. A German chemical company, BASF, and a US company, Novomer, are capturing CO2 from power plants or other waste sources, using novel catalysts to make polypropylene carbonate. This plastic can be used for coatings, adhesives, foams and packaging and can replace other plastics in these applications that are currently made from oil. Both companies are moving towards commercial processes. Bayer, another large German chemical company, is also advancing a process to make polyurethane foams using carbon dioxide. A more brute force approach is that taken by the Solar Jet programme in Switzerland, led by Dr Aldo Steinfeld of ETH-Zurich collaborating with Shell. They designed a clever reactor that generates very high temperatures from solar energy to break down carbon dioxide and water, converting them to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. From this mixture they can make kerosene for jet fuel using well-known chemical processes. This is still at an early stage – so far they have made one litre of fuel – but sometimes these high temperature processes are more straightforward to scale up than catalyst-based approaches. Carbon dioxide utilisation is attracting clever chemists and engineers, start-up venture capital and big established players. This is an area to watch for one or more revolutions of the chemical industry in the next five years. The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

That is the stark conclusion of a report by a team led by British economist Nicholas Stern. The group, based at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, concludes that action planned by countries – in particular the European Union, the US and China – will still leave the world emitting 20bn tonnes of carbon a year in excess of levels needed to prevent global warming from having devastating consequences. “Intended national contributions will not be consistent with the international goal of limiting the rise in global mean surface temperature to no more than 2C,” states the report, whose publication follows Saturday’s climate action march in London which organisers say was attended by 20,000 people. Scientists say 2C is the maximum increase in temperature the world can tolerate without risking environmental mayhem – which could include rises in sea level, melting of the ice caps, drought in Africa, America and Asia, storms and ocean acidification. Loss of ice caps would lead to less solar energy being reflected back into space, while thawing tundra would release more methane and other greenhouse gases currently frozen in polar regions . Both processes could lead to even greater temperature rises. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to hold talks in Paris at the end of 2015 in an attempt to get nations – particularly in the developed world – to agree to binding reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This would be achieved by closing fossil-fuel power stations, building renewable energy plants and improving energy efficiency in homes and factories. The EU, US and China – which, combined, emit the most carbon – have all indicated the likely pledges they intend to give in Paris towards cutting emissions so that by 2030 global temperatures will be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. In carrying out their analysis, the group split countries into two groups: one including the EU, the US and China, the other made up the remaining nations. The EU has proposed cutting its carbon emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030, while the US has announced that it intends to cut emissions by 26%-28% of 2005 levels by 2025. At the same time China has said it plans to stop its emissions rising beyond 2030. The group worked out how much carbon the EU, US and China – if they keep their promises – would then be putting into the atmosphere by 2030 and concluded that they would, in total, be emitting 21-22bn tonnes a year. By contrast, the rest of the world – which includes growing economies such as Brazil and India – are likely to be emitting around 34bn tonnes, according to figures supplied by the International Energy Agency. In total, this gives a likely carbon emissions output of 55-56bn tonnes a year by 2030. However, the maximum emissions target that has a reasonable chance of curtailing temperatures at 2C has been calculated as having a median value of about 36bn tonnes. In short, the world will still be emitting far too much carbon – an excess of some 20bn tonnes a year – to give the planet a reasonable chance of holding back the heat to a manageable level. The authors conclude three courses of action must now be followed to rectify the dangerous gap they have uncovered: ■ Nations should work even harder over the next few months to improve emission pledges at Paris. ■ Investment should be increased in innovation aimed at improving renewable clean energy generation. ■ A mechanism should be created for countries to review and improve their emission reductions in future years. They say: “The period following the summit in Paris in December 2015 will be crucial, not just to bridge the gap between aggregate intentions and the goal by 2030, but also to lay foundations for even greater action after 2030.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/apr/14/tory-conservatives-greens-manifestos-designs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-14T12:05:58Z","webTitle":"The Tory manifesto is disguised as a generic corporate brochure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/tory-conservatives-greens-manifestos-designs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/apr/14/tory-conservatives-greens-manifestos-designs","fields":{"headline":"The Tory manifesto is disguised as a generic corporate brochure","bodyText":"Could it be the board of governors’ report from your children’s overpriced independent school? Or the annual review from your personal wealth management consultants? Ah no, it’s the Conservative manifesto of course, this year disguised as a generic corporate brochure, clearly designed to be at home in the baize-lined in-trays of the Tory heartland. It follows a similar format to the 2010 manifesto, with its authoritative statement on a simple navy blue cover, only this time it has the added bonus of a photograph of the people you would be voting in. Whether this is actually a bonus is debatable. No doubt intended to instil confidence in the executive cabinet – a personification of the STRONG LEADERSHIP headlined below – it looks more like the boardroom finale at the end of The Apprentice. Theresa May in particular seems to be longing for Alan Sugar to burst in, point the finger and declare: “Dave, you’re fired.” Look closely and you’ll even see a little black desk partition (or is it the headmaster’s cane?) dividing Team May, Javid and Morgan from Cameron, Osborne and McVey; the former three leaning in, as if desperately trying to eavesdrop on what the boss is explaining to his chief prefect. George Osborne, keen to look the part, has a ring-binder open at the ready, containing what must be the CLEAR ECONOMIC PLAN alluded to below. A plan so clear that it appears to fit on a single side of A4. They should have known to stick to the text-only approach. Last election’s famously airbrushed headshot of Cameron, which gave him the waxy look of an embalmed dictator, dramatically backfired, spawning a tidal wave of mocking memes. This stock-photo cabinet-and-caption cover design is only an invitation for more of the same. As for the text, it shows a shift from last election’s traditional serifed typeface to bold sans-serif caps. A progressive move, they might imagine, but it instead recalls the bold block type used in the era of negative campaigning in the 1970s and 1980s, dreamed up by the Saatchis, that cemented the image of the “Nasty Party”. While Labour’s minimalist 2015 manifesto has sensibly ditched their party logo – perhaps realising the rose has become entirely illegible since it was confined in a strange box – the Tories are back with their scribbled oak tree, this time sporting a union jack costume. When the tree was unveiled in 2006, imagined as a brave new image of “strength, endurance, renewal and growth”, it drew ridicule from Tory grandees. They compared it to everything from a bunch of broccoli to the work of a three-year-old let loose with a crayon. But with the union jack get-up, it’s got a whole lot worse. Slumped in a forlorn heap at the bottom of the page, the country’s flag now looks like a tatty wind-beaten rag, as if torn and battered by five years of austerity. Is this the symbol of a BRIGHTER, MORE SECURE FUTURE? The Greens manifesto The Greens have also launched their manifesto on Tuesday, along with a fun-size “mini manifesto”, designed as a 15-page booklet that people might actually read. Its approach couldn’t be more different: if the Tories are posing as accomplished executives, besuited leaders in the boardroom of power, the Greens just want to be your friends. The party leaders are even smiling in the opening spread. Might these politicians actually be real people with emotions? But rather than them, they want you to think that it’s all about YOU. The cover title declares VOTE FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN in blocked-out text, tilted jauntily askew over a photo-montage, displaying what are presumably some of the things you might believe in: money, departure boards, pencils, houses and solar energy. They all seem like good things. While the Tory publication looks like a corporate annual report, this has more of the look and feel of a local council recycling leaflet. It is full of thematic colour-coded spreads inside, each election issue brandished with a hashtag – reminding us, like your dad at the disco, that this is the party for the yoof. As for the question of the logo, it’s another shocker. Even BP, surely the ultimate enemy of the Greens, has done a better job of looking like it might have something to do with being green. The Greens’ logo seems like it is supposed to be the globe emerging from a halo of leaves, or adorned with a classical wreath like a Roman emperor. But, at most distances, the leaves look more like flames, as if the earth has erupted into an infernal ball of hellfire. Which may well be what will happen if the Greens don’t get their way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/oct/29/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-29T19:02:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/29/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/oct/29/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A report about the most distant galaxy detected by astronomers said that it had a mass of 1bn suns and was 40bn to 50bn times lighter than the Milky Way.

Just 10 companies are responsible for a third of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) study. “We have got to close down the worst polluting plants in Australia,” said Geoff Cousins, ACF’s president. “At the moment the government is offering no incentives for companies to get off fossil fuels.” Cousins said he would welcome the kind of direct regulations placed by Barack Obama’s US administration on coal-fired plants, effectively making them untenable without expensive carbon capture technology. “In Australia there are taxpayer subsidies to keep these plants open, whereas in the US, China and parts of Europe, the government is taking actual direct action to close them down,” Cousins said. When direct and indirect emissions, such as energy consumption by a coal power station, are considered, the top 10 polluters emitted 158m tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2013-14. Most of this pollution comes from the production and use of energy. The list is headed by Energy Australia, responsible for 20.8m tonnes of heat-trapping gas. Macquarie Generation, at 20.3m tonnes, and AGL Energy, at 19.9m tonnes, are in second and third position. The rest of the top 10 comprises energy and mining giants, including Rio Tinto, Origin Energy and Alcoa. EnergyAustralia and Origin Energy chalked up the largest rises in emissions from 2012-13 to 2013-14, at 66% and 230% respectively. This was due to the companies buying power stations previously owned by the New South Wales government. A separate ranking of Australia’s most polluting power stations is dominated by ageing power stations burning carbon-intensive brown coal in Victoria’s La Trobe valley. Hazelwood, owned by GDF Suez, emits 15.5m tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, followed in the rankings by Yallourn and Loy Yang B. The ACF report also notes the political donations made by the large energy and mining companies. For example, EnergyAustralia donated more than $45,000 to the Labor and Coalition parties, at both state and federal level, in 2013-14. Victoria has previously considered shutting down its most polluting power stations, only for the plan to be shelved. The introduction of carbon pricing included a large hand-out to the brown coal polluters, while the federal Coalition’s new Direct Action plan, which provides voluntary grants to lower emissions, is aimed at “cleaning up” power plants rather than shutting them down. The UN’s IPCC has said that fossil fuel energy without largely unproven carbon capture technology must be phased out by the end of the century if the world is to avoid highly dangerous climate change. The ACF said Australia needed to start phasing out fossil fuels, pointing to Energy Supply Association of Australia data that shows wind and solar energy projects already earmarked could provide a quarter of Australia’s electricity demand by 2023-24 “These companies should not be paid to shut down,” Cousins said. “There should be compensation for redundancies and retraining, but to pay them to shut down is wrong.” But a spokesman for Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, said: “Labor ran a failed contract-for-closure program. By contrast, we have passed the emissions reduction fund which is about to hold its first auction. “We are not about to abandon our legislated policy in favour of an utterly failed policy.” Cousins said there was a “real disconnect” between large energy companies acknowledging the risks posed by climate change and their opposition to the renewable energy target, a measure to increase clean energy that the Coalition wants to pare back. “I think it will be very possible to change the policies of the government on this matter,” Cousins said. “There has been a remarkable coming together of events – climate change got on the G20 agenda against the wishes of the government, there was that remarkable speech by Obama at the Queensland University and there was the China-US climate deal. “I think this has led the population to realise that we are being left behind, that the government has pulled the wool over our eyes. And now we see fossil fuels and climate change are back in the top five areas of concern in voting intentions. It’s clear the government is completely out of kilter with the rest of the world.” This article was amended on 20 March 2015. The original said that Rio Tinto gave $175m to the Coalition-linked Cormack Foundation. While this is true, it was for an investment vehicle rather than a political donation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/15/axa-warns-companies-linked-fossil-fuel-risk-reputations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-15T17:17:30Z","webTitle":"Axa IM warns that companies linked to fossil fuels risk their reputations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/axa-warns-companies-linked-fossil-fuel-risk-reputations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/15/axa-warns-companies-linked-fossil-fuel-risk-reputations","fields":{"headline":"Axa IM warns that companies linked to fossil fuels risk their reputations","bodyText":"The reputations of companies linked to fossil fuels are at immediate risk from a fast-growing divestment campaign, one of Europe’s biggest asset managers has warned. Only a quarter of existing, exploitable fossil fuel reserves are burnable if global warming is not to exceed dangerous levels, according to recent analyses. Campaigners have called for divestment on moral grounds but, if governments fulfil their pledges to curb climate change, trillions of dollars of coal, oil and gas held by investors would become worthless. “[That] climate risk is becoming synonymous with reputation risk,” said Luisa Florez, senior responsible investment analyst at Axa Investment Managers, which manages over €600bn (£459bn) of assets. “Undoubtedly, there are a number of factors behind the recent decline in oil prices, such as shale gas development. Nevertheless, moral issues are also playing a growing role, with the divestment movement steadily gaining traction amongst investors across the globe.” Florez said the fossil fuel divestment campaign has echoes of the anti-apartheid divestment movement of the 1980s which targeted South Africa. She said the new campaign had already led, for example, to the big four Australian banks losing AU$400m (£216m) worth of fossil-fuel business. “It is often said that climate and carbon themes are not financially material risk factors in the short to medium term. [But] we believe that climate risk should not be neglected in the investment decisions that investors are making today,” Florez said. “It should also be considered as an investment opportunity, with the potential to offer good financial returns.” “The opportunity now exists to consider the low-carbon-economy theme, thanks to economies of scale in the renewable sector,” she said. The plummeting cost of solar energy led to a surge in green energy investment in 2014. Florez said there were now “proven pathways to invest in attractive names offering green and energy efficient products through green bonds”, issues of which tripled to $37bn in 2014. Axa IM’s warning comes as a flurry of reports suggesting a gloomy future for coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels and heavily represented on London stock exchanges. The rapid expansion of renewable energy combined with weakening electricity demand are driving a “structural decline” in coal markets, particularly coal exported to power stations, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a US research group. The IEEFA report concluded India cannot afford to continue importing coal, with its finance minister considering ending imports entirely within two to three years. China’s demand for coal will peak permanently by 2016, with imports falling by 11% in 2014; US coal exports fell 20% in 2014, the group said. “Coal companies’ underperformance against the global equity market is unprecedented,” said the IEEFA’s Tim Buckley. “A more than 50% decline in coal prices has seen most listed coal companies globally lose 80-90% of their equity market value in the last four years. While the sun will undoubtedly rise for renewable energy in 2015, for coal, there remains a lot further to fall.” In the European Union, power sector carbon emissions fell by 8% in 2014, according to official data analysed by the London-based thinktank Sandbag. The bulk of the decline resulted from reduced coal burning as electricity consumption fell. A separate analysis, by Carbon Brief, found that in 2015 the UK’s coal use is set to fall to levels not seen since the 1850s, having fallen 20% in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2015/jan/12/brian-coxs-human-universe-like-a-tourism-ad-directed-by-doctor-who","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-12T01:45:31Z","webTitle":"Brian Cox's Human Universe – like a tourism ad directed by Doctor Who","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/12/brian-coxs-human-universe-like-a-tourism-ad-directed-by-doctor-who","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/12/brian-coxs-human-universe-like-a-tourism-ad-directed-by-doctor-who","fields":{"headline":"Brian Cox's Human Universe – like a tourism ad directed by Doctor Who","bodyText":"There’s something unnecessarily anthropocentric about the title of Brian Cox’s new show, Human Universe. Given there are more bacteria on Earth than people, the show could just as easily be called Salmonella Galaxy but I’m guessing that wasn’t thought to be as catchy. Patting Homo sapiens over-enthusiastically on the back (of which more in a bit) is the only gripe I had with the show’s otherwise excellent first episode. Naturally it had all the Brian Cox tropes, which you’ll love or hate: the half-man half-silhouette wandering past gorgeous vistas, scattering mind-boggling facts in his wake like a tourism ad directed by Doctor Who. The visuals alone are a great watch but there are revelations that make this fresh take on evolution even more compelling. Jumps in human brain size, Cox tells us, may have been responding to bursts of violent climate change, itself contingent on periods when the Earth’s orbit was at its most elliptical. That orbit owed itself to the makeup of our solar system, including the Earth’s relationship with the moon. And it’s the way these climate shifts were felt in the Great Rift valley that prompted our brain’s growth. Before our evolution could even begin, an improbably long line of causal dominoes needed to fall. It’s humbling to think that if the moon were a bit larger – or a bit smaller – we might all be really stupid. What an inconspicuous connection! It’s like finding out we don’t die in our sleep every night thanks to the shape of Hawaii. Putting human beings in their place using astronomical scale is one of Cox’s great gifts and a reason I’ll keep watching, but the praise he heaps on us for our abilities to travel into space seems a little over-egged. There’s unnecessary boastfulness: “Why is it that we alone have ventured into space?” I don’t know, Brian. I’m sure prawns are trying their hardest; maybe they’re just crap pilots. He then goes on to declare humanity is a “space-faring civilisation” which makes me feel like a right idiot for going everywhere by bus. Sure, for the sake of a Kubrick-esque narrative arc, it’s neat to go from spearhead to spaceship, an enormous leap in our technological abilities encapsulated perfectly by this opening episode’s closing moments. But space travel is still a somewhat forced purpose for humankind. There are lots of practical failings we haven’t remedied yet, such as how to embrace solar energy – something carrots figured out ages ago. And if giraffes were singlehandedly obliterating the environment while drone-striking gazelles, I doubt we’d hold them in high regard as they fled their mess by blasting off into space: “They ruined everything but they do craft a fancy escape pod. Gotta give ’em that.” We’ve come a long way and this show demonstrates that fact best when it focuses on where we started rather than fostering an infatuation with where we’ve ended up. Yes, 533 humans have orbited the Earth, but 4 million people pre-ordered the iPhone 6. It’s hard to praise humanity based on its ventures to stars that most people can’t be bothered lifting their heads to look at. Then again, maybe that’s why we need more shows like this. • The next episode of Human Universe airs on ABC1 on 14 January at 8.30pm.

As scientists predicted, this year’s season for harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie rivalled record blooms of 2011. Researchers note that if land management practices and climate change trends continue, the lake is likely to see more blooms that kill fish and affect water safety. In April, Nasa and several partners announced a new multi-agency effort to develop an early warning indicator for harmful algal blooms in fresh water. For three ice-free months a year, False Pass provides a shortcut for fishermen making their way between the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. But in the Arctic, the location of sandbars and channels can shift significantly because of the movement and melting of ice, seasonal sedimentation, and erosion, and can lead to maritime mishaps. So each year, before vessels start to use False Pass, the US Coast Guard must send out buoy tenders to mark the shifting channels. New remote sensing techniques might make that job easier and more accurate. Shachak Pe’eri, a researcher at the University of New Hampshire, has pioneered turbidity mapping as a proxy for bathymetric (depth) measurements. In enclosed water bodies with strong currents (such as bays and sounds), turbid channels show up on Landsat imagery, showing where currents are carving deeper channels that are safe for boat passage. Pe’eri has been collaborating with colleagues at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the Coast Guard to identify some of these areas from space. With the help of Landsat SDB turbidity maps, the new locations of sandbars can be better estimated. Recently this has led to the discovery of a new, straighter, and more geologically stable channel in Bechevin Bay, which was captured by satellites. Satellite images of Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula often focus on the area’s many volcanoes. In these images, however, the plumes were produced by ships. Large tankers, container ships, and other vessels emit some pollution particles as exhaust; other aerosol pollutants form indirectly as exhaust gases mix and cool in the atmosphere. Water vapour can then condense around these tiny particles to form long, narrow clouds known as ship tracks. Hurricanes traversing the Pacific Ocean are often solitary storms. Occasionally they show up in pairs. But according to meteorologists, August 2015 marked the first time in recorded history that three Category 4 storms simultaneously paraded over the central and eastern Pacific. The top image shows a nighttime view of hurricanes Kilo, Ignacio, and Jimena (from west to east) surrounding Hawaii, while the second image shows the storms about 12 hours later during daylight hours. Ships queuing along the Danube river near the Romanian town of Zimnicea. In May 2015, hot, dry weather in the Magway region of Myanmar gave way to flooding in the monsoon season. Heavy rains harmed crops, displaced thousands of residents, and led to numerous deaths across the nation. The widespread flooding has affected many rivers, including the Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady). In the composite above, the right image shows the swollen Irrawaddy River on 3 August 2015, and the left image shows the river at a more normal level on 29 August 2013. Areas of land are shown in natural colour and appear brown and green. Areas with water are shown in false-colour and appear bright blue. The artificially blue water makes it easier to see; during floods, disturbed sediment often colours rivers brown, which can make flood waters difficult to distinguish from land. Flooding during the monsoon season is not unusual in Myanmar, but the country has not seen this magnitude of flooding in several decades. The flooding was likely worsened by cyclone Komen, which ravaged parts of the country a week earlier. In most American states, the Turtle Mountains — which rise 600 to 800 feet (180 to 240 metres) above the surrounding plain — would be called hills. But in North Dakota, one of the flattest states, people have a habit of calling even relatively modest rises mountains. Whether hills or mountains, the hummocky highlands that straddle the border between North Dakota and southern Manitoba have enough elevation that they receive significantly more precipitation than the surrounding plains. As shown by this image, enough moisture collects on the hills to support forests. The surrounding lowlands are a patchwork of grasslands and farms. In this detailed view of a largely undeveloped part of Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, hundreds of ponds and lakes pockmark the landscape. Many of the lakes shown in the satellite image were formed when blocks of buried ice melted, leaving space underground for the overlying sediment to slump down. This left depressions in the surface that geologists call kettles. Over time, many kettles filled with water, leaving the familiar “kettle lakes” or “prairie potholes” that are so common in the Turtle Mountains today. Astronaut Scott Kelly posted this photo of Spain taken from the International Space Station on Instagram with the caption: “Color palette of the #Spanish coast is an appealing morning view. #GoodMorning from @ISS! #YearInSpace #colors #colorful #earth #space #spacestation #iss #morning”. The source of the smoke appears to be industrial fires associated with two massive explosions that occurred late on 12 August at a port in Tianjin, China. Wildfires in eastern China likely produced the streams of light grey smoke also visible in the images. A series of images show the smoke moving east in the early morning before winds sent it curling south. The Drakelands mine (previously known as the Hemerdon mine) is a historic tungsten and tin mine located north-east of Plymouth, England. Tin and tungsten deposits were discovered in 1867, and the mine operated until 1944. Last year work started to re-open the mine, which hosts the fourth-largest tungsten and tin deposits in the world. Tungsten has innumerable uses due to its incredible density and high melting temperature. Yet more than 80% of world supply is controlled by China, who has imposed restriction on export of the metal. On 11 August, this false-colour view shows what appears to be a large bloom of cyanobacteria swirling in the Baltic Sea. Cyanobacteria are an ancient type of marine bacteria that, like other phytoplankton, capture and store solar energy through photosynthesis. Blooms like this flourish in the Baltic Sea during summertime, when there is ample sunlight and high levels of nutrients. Satellite images alone cannot say definitively that this bloom contains cyanobacteria — analysis of ocean water samples would be required to confirm it. Yet, “major cyanobacteria blooms have appeared nearly every summer for a while now, and they always look like this in the satellite data,” explained Nasa oceanographer Norman Kuring. Fortunately, Maren Voss of the Leibniz Institute of Baltic Sea Research, a phytoplankton and cyanobacteria expert, happened to be in the area on a research cruise. She confirmed that the bloom contained a type of cyanobacteria called Nodularia. Writing in an email from the field, she noted: “We steamed through ‘carpets’ of it the entire day yesterday west of Gotland.” Voss’s vessel was not the only ship in the sea. Tracks of several other ships show up as dark lines where they have cut through the bloom in the large image. One of these ships is especially apparent in the top image, which shows a close-up view of part of the bloom. As the northern hemisphere experiences its warmest months of the year, ice is moving and melting in Arctic waters and on the frozen lands that surround it. Such is the case along the edge of the Helheim and Zachariae glaciers on Greenland’s east coast. Nasa’s Aqua satellite acquired these two images of ice swirling off of Greenland, shaped by winds and currents that move across the sea. Ice coverage in the Arctic this year shrank to its fourth lowest extent on record, US scientists announced earlier this month. Fires have raged throughout Alaska in 2015. According to a report from the Alaska Interagency Coordination Centre, fires have now burned 5,098,829.9 acres this year. It has edged past the previous second-worst year, which was 1957 with 5,049,661 acres burned. The amount of acreage burned in Alaska during June 2015 shattered the previous record set in June 2004 by more than 700,000 acres. Ten years after making landfall, the marshes and swamps that buffer New Orleans from the Gulf of Mexico still show evidence of hurricane Katrina. The wetlands surrounding Delacroix, a fishing town to the south-east of New Orleans, were some of the hardest hit by the hurricane. Pounding surf, driving winds, and a potent storm surge transformed the marshes by picking apart mats of dead grass, stirring up and disbursing soft underlying sediments, scouring several new channels, and depositing leftover sediment and debris in new areas. This pair of false-colour images shows the transformation with at right: a week before the storm hit and left in August 2015. With this band combination, normal vegetation appears bright green and flood-damaged vegetation is brown. Water is dark blue. Katrina delivered a massive surge of water that dramatically enlarged lakes, including Lake Lery and Petit Lake. It also scoured new channels and widened canals in ways that eliminated large amounts of marshland. As seen in the 2015 image, flood-damaged vegetation has returned to its normal colour, but the enlarged waterways have persisted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-24T12:44:21Z","webTitle":"George Osborne puts UK at the heart of global race for mini-nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne puts UK at the heart of global race for mini-nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The UK could be the global centre of a new nuclear industry in mini-reactors that are trucked into a town near you to provide your hot water, or shipped to any country that wants to plug them into their electricity grid from the dock. The chancellor, George Osborne, revealed on Wednesday that at least £250m will be spent by 2020 on an “ambitious” programme to “position the UK as a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies”. There will be a competition to identify the best value design of mini reactors - called small modular reactors (SMRs) - and paving the way “towards building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s”. There is no shortage of contenders, with companies from the US to China and Poland all wooing the UK with their proposals. With a crucial UN climate change summit in Paris imminent, the question of how to keep the lights on affordably, while cutting emissions, is pressing. SMRs aim to capture the advantages of nuclear power – always-on, low-carbon energy – while avoiding the problems, principally the vast cost and time taken to build huge plants. Current plants, such as the planned French-Chinese Hinkley Point project in Somerset, have to be built on-site, a task likened to “building a cathedral within a cathedral”. Instead, SMRs, would be turned out by the dozen in a factory, then transported to sites and plugged in, making them – in theory – cheaper. Companies around the world, including in Russia, South Korea and Argentina, are now trying to turn that theory into practice and many are looking at the nuclear-friendly UK as the place to make it happen. “There’s a lot of terrific things about the UK market that makes it the right place to deploy new nuclear technology,” said Tom Mundy, head of programme development at US company NuScale, one of the frontrunners. “It’s got a government committed to reducing carbon and seeing nuclear as one of the solutions, and it has got a substantial and pre-eminent legacy of nuclear operations – a trained and capable workforce and a nuclear supply chain.” The UK has commissioned five studies since July, costing £4.5m, to explore the potential of SMRs and energy secretary Amber Rudd told MPs earlier this month: “We are fully enthused about SMRs. We are doing as much as we can in terms of supporting the technology. SMRs would be an excellent way forward.” A government-funded report from the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) in December 2014 suggested there was potentially a “very significant” global market for hundreds of SMRs (65-85 gigawatts) by 2035, with dozens of the SMRs (7GW) sited in the UK. This market would be worth £250-£400bn, the NNL estimated, saying it represented an economic opportunity for UK plc. SMRs are reactors that produce less than 300MW (0.3GW) of electricity, much smaller than the 1,000MW (1GW) of many existing nuclear plants. An additional advantage is that SMRs can vary their output quickly, meaning they could be used to balance intermittent wind and solar energy, unlike big nuclear plants. Small reactors have been operated for more than 50 years, particularly on military submarines and ships. But, Mundy said: “The application they are designed for is completely different from civil nuclear electricity.” Small reactors have also run a remote site at Bilibino in Siberia since 1976, with the excess steam supplying a district heating system, while a US base in Antarctica was powered by a tiny reactor in the 1960s. But no true SMRs, rolling off a factory assembly line, have yet been built. Determining the best companies for SMR designs means looking for scale and experience, says Giorgio Locatelli, at the University of Leeds. He points to US nuclear giant Westinghouse, NuScale, Korea – which has signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia – and the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). “The Chinese government has a pile of money to invest,” Locatelli said. Danrong Song, CNNC’s chief designer for SMRs, attended an SMR conference in London in October and pitched a “technical plan and proposal for cooperation with UK industry” – the company is already cooperating with Rolls Royce. This plan would see the first CNNC SMR produced in the UK, with subsequent SMRs being sold around the world, he said, mirroring the plan to build a large Chinese nuclear plant at Bradwell in Essex. Song said China itself could provide a big market: “A lot of air pollution in China is caused by fossil fuel plants, so with SMRs we can reduce that.” Large nuclear plants needed a lot of cooling water and were therefore mainly built on the coast, he said, limiting their use. “But inland, you can build SMRs and use air cooling,” Song said. CNNC’s design, the ACP100+, would produce 120MW of electricity, be refuelled every two years and could even be put on a ship, said Song. CNNC signed an agreement with Lloyd’s Register in October to develop marine nuclear regulations. Such ships could be floating power plants, said Kristiina Soderholm, at Finnish energy company Fortum, which runs several nuclear plants. She said an SMR could be put on a barge, taken to a country, plugged into grid from the port and then, when its fuel was used up, sail back again. “For newcomer countries [to nuclear], that could be a very attractive way to do it,” she said. It has happened before: in the late 1960s a former US military nuclear-powered ship moored by the Panama canal and provided onshore electricity. Russia, which has long experience of marine nuclear power, has been promising a floating SMR for several years. But the project has been repeatedly delayed, although it is unclear whether the reason is technical or financial. Westinghouse, part of Toshiba and one of the world’s biggest nuclear companies, is staying on land with its 225MW (electricity) SMR, which it says could be deployed by 2027. “There’s a unique opportunity for the UK to move from being a buyer to a provider, said Jeff Benjamin, head of new build and major programmes. “We hope the build out of our SMR will happen here in the UK … but then use this as a base to export globally.” Westinghouse made a proposal to the UK in October to put its designs into a new company in which the UK government and industry took a stake and then shared the development costs. “This is what is going to be necessary to move this market forward in the UK,” said Benjamin. “We are not asking the UK government to swallow the elephant all at once.” UK ministers are considering the offer. One big potential customer in Europe is coal-dependent Poland, seen as the biggest nuclear market in Europe and often chastised internationally for its reluctance to reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change. “I want to persuade the UK to partner with Poland: it has the skills, we have the need,” Grzegorz Wrochna, director of Poland’s National Centre for Nuclear Research, told the London summit. Compared to Westinghouse’s SMR, that from NuScale is much smaller – 50MW of electricity. This to maximise the number of places it can be sited, said Mundy, with the 23m-long unit being “the biggest you can get on the road”. If more power is needed, multiple reactors could be be installed side-by-side. The company, backed by a $217m (£143m) cost-sharing deal from the US Department of Energy (DoE), aims to start generating electricity for its first customer in Idaho by 2023, Mundy said. Other SMR contenders include US-based Generation mPower, also backed by the US DoE, while more novel technology, such as that from Bill Gates-backed Terrapower, are seen as prospects further in the future. The pilot plant closest to completion is CAREM in Argentina and was initially intended for use in submarines. But for all the activity, the nascent SMR industry faces familiar nuclear challenges: cost, public acceptability, security and waste disposal. The nuclear industry has a long record of broken promises over cost – Hinkley-type reactors being built by EDF in France and Finland are billions over budget and years behind schedule. Developing SMRs is not going to be cheap either. Design alone will cost £500m, estimates David Orr, head of nuclear business development at UK engineering firm Rolls Royce, which is “actively engaged” in the technology. He said 40-70 SMRs would need to be ordered to make building a factory worthwhile. Industry figures say the cost of electricity from the first SMRs should be about the same as large nuclear power plants, then get cheaper. But Locatelli said: “We don’t yet know if the cost of electricity from an SMR is going to be cheaper than from big plants, but the risk is lower” because the capital needed is smaller. All the while, the competition from renewable energy gets hotter as it falls in price. Most new energy projects – from nuclear to fracking to windfarms – face some opposition. But Professor Andrew Sherry, chief scientist at the UK’s NNL said: “Political support for [large nuclear power plants] has been unified and public support is quite strong.” However, SMRs could be much closer to people’s homes, he said, and might be used to provide hot water for central heating as well as electricity. “Small factory-built nuclear plants could be located closer, say within 20 to 40 miles, to users and provide a combined heat and power function,” said former UK environment secretary Owen Paterson in 2014. Sherry asks: “Would people accept district heating from nuclear?” Security is also a key issue for nuclear plants. Canada’s Bruce Power runs the biggest operational nuclear site in the world in Ontario, with 6.3GW of capacity across eight reactors. Protecting the site requires armed guards and Frank Saunders, head of nuclear oversight and regulatory affairs at Bruce Power, said the company has “the largest tactical unit outside the military” in the province. The challenge for SMRs is that security costs soar relative to power output if there are small reactors in many locations to protect. “The security costs are hugely magnified when you go to smaller units,” said Saunders. While SMRs may need refuelling less frequently – potentially decades – and use uranium more efficiently than earlier generations of reactor, the permanent disposal of nuclear waste remains a vexed issue around the world. No deep geological repository has yet gained final approval. Despite the challenges, engineer Gordon Waddington, who led the NNL report, is confident SMRs have a future because of the demand for low-carbon electricity. For example, he said: “I am absolutely certain that China will get very good at [SMRs]. They need it and they will get there.” Waddington said the next two to three years are critical if SMRs are to be deployed widely in the next decade, and the UK has a once-in-a-generation chance to be at the heart of it: “The window of opportunity for the UK is there – but it will not be open forever.” This article was amended on Thursday 26 November to include the most recent announcements made by George Osborne in the spending review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/25/satellite-eye-on-earth-march-2016-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-25T10:48:43Z","webTitle":"Satellite Eye on Earth: March 2016 - in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/25/satellite-eye-on-earth-march-2016-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/25/satellite-eye-on-earth-march-2016-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Satellite Eye on Earth: March 2016 - in pictures","bodyText":"Thousands of saline lakes span the south-western part of Western Australia, at the headwaters of the Frankland river, north of Stirling Range national park. Millions of years ago, declines in rainfall caused river flows to ebb and river valleys to fill in with sediment. Wind then sculpted the loose sediment to form the lake basins that remain today. Some of the lakes now fill with runoff directly from the Stirling Range; others are controlled primarily by groundwater. Many of the saltwater lakes in this region are short-lived. Still, a range of salt-loving aquatic invertebrates, such as brine shrimp, have adapted to the tough conditions. They can handle both the temporary absence of water, and water that can be several times saltier than seawater. The Deep Space Climate Observatory captures a total eclipse of the sun from space for the first time, showing the shadow of the moon marching across Earth’s sunlit face, on 9 March. In the early 2000s, the area east of Cotulla, Texas, was dry, sleepy shrubland. By 2015, a bustling network of roads and rectangular drill pads had completely transformed the landscape. The pair of satellite images below shows how much the landscape has changed - the “before” image was captured in December 2000; the “after” image in December 2015. According to a report from the Texas Observer, Cotulla saw its population swell from about 4,000 to 10,000 people in just a few years due to an influx of oil and gas workers for “fracking”. In nighttime satellite imagery, the light from the Eagle Ford shale formation competes with the nearby cities of San Antonio and Austin. The electric glow of drilling equipment, worker camps, and other gas and oil infrastructure combine with flickering gas flares to create an unmistakable arc of light across southern Texas. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder aboard Nasa’s Aqua satellite shows global methane concentrations in January 2016 at a pressure of 400 hectopascals, or roughly 6km above the surface. Methane is a chemical compound that shows up nearly everywhere on the planet. It bubbles up from swamps and rivers, belches from volcanoes, rises from wildfires, and seeps from the guts of cows and termites. Human settlements are awash with the gas. Methane leaks silently from natural gas and oil wells and pipelines, as well as coal mines. It stews in landfills, sewage treatment plants, and rice paddies. It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and yet the reasons for why and where it shows up are often a mystery. What science shows is that a lot more methane has made its way into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Less understood is why the ebb and flow of this gas has changed in recent decades. Since 2007, methane has been on the rise, and no one is quite sure why. Some scientists think tropical wetlands have gotten a bit wetter and are releasing more gas. Others point to the natural gas fracking boom in North America and its sometimes leaky infrastructure. Others wonder if changes in agriculture may be playing a role. A river of dust flows from the Saharan desert across the Mediterranean Sea behind a strong cold front. A line of heavy cloud marks the leading edge of the cold front as it marches from east to west. The landscape ahead of the front appears crisply defined while cloud and dust obscure most of the land and water from view behind the leading edge. This cold front was part of a cyclonic system named Golia that created severe weather across the region. Italy was hit especially hard, with heavy rain, high wind gusts, and storm surges battering the southern part of the country while snowstorms hit the north. Five people were reported killed in Italy from extreme weather caused by Golia. As the cold front moved across the Mediterranean, sand and dust from as far south as the Sahara desert rode moved behind the front. It is not uncommon for strong southerly winds to carry dust from Africa across the Mediterranean. The dramatic spectacle of a massive movement of Saharan dust behind a crisp cold front is more rarely captured from space. A satellite view of the the northern lights (Aurora borealis) on 7 March, which appear as white streaks over Iceland, the north Atlantic and Norway. It is not often that the northern lights are visible south of Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a geomagnetic storm coloured night skies over a much wider swath of the country. The brilliant colours of the aurora are provoked by activity the sun: solar energy and particles speed toward Earth in a steady stream called the solar wind, or they rush out in massive eruptions known as coronal mass ejections. These storms disturb geospace (the space around Earth) and energise particles already trapped in the magentosphere and radiation belts. Electrons then race down Earth’s magnetic field lines and crash into the gases at high altitudes of the atmosphere. Oxygen gives off a green colour when excited; nitrogen produces blue or red colours. Vivid colours and an extraordinary range of shapes and patterns fill this satellite image of central Iran. The colours have an otherworldly look for good reason. In contrast to the natural-colour Landsat images, this is a false-colour image composed from light that is invisible to human eyes. False-colour satellite images often have a vibrant and otherworldly look. Though they can be quite beautiful and even seem artistic, a carefully interpreted false-colour image can provide remarkable scientific insights as well. Comparing these false and natural-colour versions of this image of the Yazd and South Khorosan provinces of Iran, it is much easier to make out the boundaries between different rock layers and formations in false colour. It is also possible to see where water flows down from the dark ridges on the western edge of the false-colour image. The streaks of green throughout the false-colour image are not representative of vegetation, but rather show the distribution of rock with a particular composition. Late winter storms dumped a fresh coating of snow across the Alps in mid-March 2016. The fresh powder was a welcome sight for skiers, snowboarders and the many resorts that cater to them. Across the Alps, snow cover was late to arrive in the winter of 2015-16. Some early November snowfall - the usual start of the season - was followed by weeks of above-average temperatures. Many locations did not see substantial snow until after New Year’s day. Weather patterns grew more seasonable in January and February, and a heavy March snowfall — 40-100cm in some areas — gave hope to the winter sports industry. This season, as well as 2014-15, fit with the long-term trend in the European Alps. For much of the 20th century, snow cover increased slightly or held steady. But in the 1980s and 90s, average winter snow cover started to decrease, and winter rainfall increased at lower altitudes. That trend has continued in the 21st century. Though the average area covered by snow in any given winter has not changed much, the depth and the duration of snow cover has decreased, particularly in the south-eastern and south-western mountains and in areas below 2,000m altitude. The image shows angular gashes in the snow-covered landscape of north-eastern Wyoming. The astronaut’s eye was drawn to the open-cast pits of several coal mines that operate out of the small town of Gillette, which appears on the lower right. The coal lies at very shallow depth, making it economical to mine. The steep walls of the overlying rocks cast strong shadows in this snowy scene. Wind distributes coal dust so that the pits appear much darker, especially the largest pit in the view (upper left). The same astronaut probably took both of these photographs of the port city of Haifa on Israel’s Mediterranean coast. In geography training, astronauts are taught to concentrate on the shapes of coastlines because they are a first-order visual cue when circling the planet, and often uniquely shaped. The nose of Cape Karmel and the bay that protects the Port of Haifa are shapes that can tell crews where they are. In the daylight image, the strong visual line of the coast contrasts with the subtle city colours. The steep slope of the north flank of Mount Carmel (bottom of the image), facing the port, is marked by a long, dark shadow in the mid-afternoon sunlight. Older neighbourhoods with linear roads lie on the lower slopes, closer to the port. Newer neighbourhoods show a pattern of streets that wind along the intricate edges of the canyons. In a small country where land is scarce, brown farmlands appear close to the middle of the city. The night shot does not show the coastline, but it does show different city neighbourhoods in a way that is difficult to see in the day. The brilliant port lights contrast with somewhat dimmer residential areas. Straight roads of the older residential neighbourhoods are easily distinguished from the winding roads that follow the canyon cliffs. The industrial area just east of the port has areas of green and blue lights and a less dense street pattern. Surrounding farmlands are so dark that they can be confused with the sea. A natural-colour image showing large numbers of small fires burning throughout the Indochina peninsula on 19 March 19. Notice the thick cloud of smoke that obscures much of western Thailand and eastern Myanmar. Fire has a long history as a land management tool in south-east Asia; most of the fires detected by the satellite were likely lit intentionally. In cultivated lowlands (tan area), farmers use fire to burn crop debris after harvest and to prepare the land for the growing season. In the mountains (green), some people practice “slash and burn” to clear forested areas with fire, planting crops for a few years, and then letting brush and forest retake the fields during a fallow period intended to replenish soil nutrients. Fires are also sometimes lit to promote the growth of grasses used to make thatch roofs and brooms, to encourage the reproduction of certain mushrooms, to make seeds of some wild plant seeds germinate, and to flush out game during hunts for wildlife. Though many of the fires were surely lit intentionally, natural conditions are potentially intensifying them and causing some to burn out of control. South-east Asia is in the midst of a drought that has parched forests and other vegetation. Observers in Vietnam are calling the drought there the worst in 90 years. The lack of rain has led to intrusions of salt water into rice paddies and other croplands along the Mekong delta. In Thailand, authorities have diverted water from the Mekong river to agricultural areas in response to the dry weather, a move that has worried neighbouring countries. In an attempt to ease tensions, China announced in March that it would release extra water into the Mekong at the Jinghong hydropower station. Over the past few decades, the global demand for construction sand has boomed, especially in Asia due to rapid urbanisation. In China alone, the demand for cement has increased 438% over the past two decades. In 2000, dredging and other sand mining become so intensive along the Yangtze river that Chinese authorities banned the activity along the lower and middle reaches of the river. This drove many sand mining operators to Poyang Lake, a large body of water that flows into the Yangtze about 600km upstream of Shanghai. This pair of false-colour images shows the impact of sand mining on the northern reaches of the lake. The first image was acquired in December 1995; the second image shows the same area in December 2013. By contrasting the two images, we can see dramatic changes in the outlet channel that connects Poyang Lake to the Yangtze river. Sand removal and dredging have deepened and widened the channel significantly. These activities also have left the remaining sandbars and shores with an irregular, serrated appearance. Using infrared dat, researchers found that the lake was producing up to 236 million cubic metres of sand per year — about 9% of the total produced by China - enough to make Poyang Lake the largest sand-mining operation in the world. Field research on wintering waterbirds the lake found that it hosted 98% of endangered Siberian cranes and oriental white storks, as well as a significant number of other endangered waterbirds. A long crack running through the ice shelf to the east of the centre part of the Antarctic peninsula. The crack is about 2km wide, but widens to 4 km or more in some places. There are also finer cracks and structures visible in the ice shelf. A floating shelf of ice attached to the coast of Antarctica appears ready to shed an iceberg into the Southern Ocean. Over the course of two years, a small crack grew large enough to spread across nearly the entire width of the Nansen Ice Shelf. The first image was acquired in December 2013 and second in December 2015. These floating shelves are important for holding back the flow of ice from the interior of the continent to the sea. Ice that sloughs from a floating shelf does not raise sea level. But lose part of the ice shelf, and the seaward flow of land ice can accelerate — a phenomenon that contributes to sea-level rise. On a map created in 1590, the area was labeled Promontorium tremendum: horrible headland, or cape terrible. Four centuries later, these barrier islands along the North Carolina coast are better known as havens for turtles and wild horses and for humans seeking a bit of tranquility by the sea. This image of Cape Lookout national park shows swirling sediments and shallow bottoms as faint green, tan, and blue areas around the islands. The yellow line around the islands notes the official boundaries of the park. This false colour image brings us to Utah’s Salt Lake City, which sits at 1,300m, bordered by the waters of the Great Salt Lake and the peaks of the Wasatch Range,. The Great Salt Lake, partly visible on the left side of the image, is the largest salt-water lake in the western hemisphere. The lighter blue areas denote solar evaporation ponds at the edges of the lake, which produce salts and brine. The lake contributes an estimated $1.3bn annually to Utah’s economy, comprising the harvesting of brine shrimp, industry in mineral extraction, and recreation. Although it has been referred to as “America’s Dead Sea”, the lake provides habitat for millions of native birds, brine shrimp, shorebirds and waterfowl. In 1904, the Southern Pacific Causeway was built to create a shorter route across the lake, visible across the top part. The mountains and several parks appear in varying shades of red, owing to this false-colour band combination. The scattered greys and whites visible along the centre of the image are the City of Salt Lake, home to some 190,000 people . Three of the major lakes in east Africa: from south-west to north-east they are the ovoid Lake Victoria, the branching Lake Kyoga and the long Lake Turkana. Several other smaller lakes also appear in this image. It has been estimated that Africa holds about 30,000 cubic kilometers (7,197 cubic miles) of water in large lakes. This is the largest volume of water in large lakes of any continent. Lakes are an integral and important part of human lives, serving as a source of livelihoods, recreation, and nourishment, as well as critical sources of drinking water. Lakes can also be risk factors, especially to those living near them, as they can be major sources of natural disasters (such as floods) as well as hosts to diseases and pollutants. As populations increase, more stress is putting on the natural ecosystem of a lake, often decreasing the ability of people to safely use the water or decreasing fisheries. Climate change can also dramatically damage a lake’s ecosystem, such as the dramatic drying of Lake Chad, which has lost about 90% of its former size. Northern Namibia’s Etosha salt pan is believed be have been a lake was first formed tens of millions of years ago. More recently – mere thousands of years ago – the Kunene river would have flowed through this area, filling the large lake before tectonic movement changed the river course. The lake then dried up, leaving behind some 4,800 sq km of exposed minerals. The pan is a designated Ramsar wetland of international importance. It is the only known mass breeding ground for flamingos in Namibia. Built-up mounds of clay and salt throughout the pan also draw animals who use them as salt lick, including lions, elephants, leopards and even black rhinoceroses. The straight lines cutting across the image are roads, and the one on the right side clearly delineates the border of the protected park to the south. On the northern side of the road, we can see agricultural structures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/03/nanas-shale-cuadrilla-fracking-lancashire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T15:12:36Z","webTitle":"Anti-fracking Nanas: 'The government is all out for shale – we're all out to stop it'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/03/nanas-shale-cuadrilla-fracking-lancashire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/03/nanas-shale-cuadrilla-fracking-lancashire","fields":{"headline":"Anti-fracking Nanas: 'The government is all out for shale – we're all out to stop it'","bodyText":"If the two security guards had been awake, they probably wouldn’t have believed their eyes. Twenty-five women aged between 25 and 60, in yellow tabards and matching Hilda Ogden headscarves, vaulting a gate in order to occupy the Blackpool field that the energy company Cuadrilla had paid the guards to mind. “Everything went smoothly, except for the logistical bits we left to the fellas,” said hairdresser Anjie Mosher, one of the group known as the Nanas, who have become the frontline against fracking in Lancashire, alongside Friends of the Earth and the Green party. The men had been tasked with arranging a van to transport the women to the field on Preston New Road in Little Plumpton, but they forgot. “We ended up having to take taxis. The driver said: ‘Where to, ladies?’ and we went: ‘If we told you, we’d have to kill you. Just drive!’ What must he have thought of all of us, with our feather dusters and tabards, carrying cakes and bunting and tea sets at 3.30 in the morning?” By the time the security guards woke up, the Nanas, plus a few useful dads and grandads, had pitched a tent, put up laminated signs asserting section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 (better known as squatters’ rights), boiled the kettle and made themselves comfortable. Operation Mothers and Grandmas (OMG) had begun. That was 7 August last year – a pivotal day in Lancashire’s anti-fracking movement and arguably the turning point in the county’s battle with Cuadrilla, which this week lost its planning bid to carry out exploratory fracking for shale gas on the site, along with another at Roseacre Wood near Preston. For three weeks the Nanas, their children and grandchildren, occupied the field, drawing widespread support from the local community as well as activists from around the country. When they left, they filmed themselves hand-delivering a letter to the farmer who had rented the field to Cuadrilla, saying they were leaving, and filmed their clean-up and departure. Yet one of their most vociferous members, Tina Louise Rothery, who stood against George Osborne for the Green party in Tatton during the general election, still ended up in court with a legal bill of £54,000 after the farmer – funded by Cuadrilla – sued her for trespass. She hasn’t paid and has no intention of doing so. Almost 20 years after Swampy climbed a tree to protest against the building of the Newbury bypass, he remains the popular image of an environmental protester: dreadlocks, camouflage jacket, tie-dye, a grubby roll-up in one hand and juggling balls in the other. Yet many of the key players behind the Lancastrian victory this week could not be further from that stereotype. “People want to label us, but I would always say: ‘look, I’m a twin-set and pearls lady.’ I’d never protested before in my life,” said Pat Davies, 59, an immaculately turned-out management consultant who became chair of the Preston New Road Community Group when it was set up in spring last year. There’s a perception that anti-fracking protesters are “crusty jugglers” said Mosher. “But we are just ordinary mothers from all sorts of backgrounds who have found a common cause.” Rebecca Fitton, a 49-year-old sculptor hadn’t thought she was the sort of person to become involved in protesting. “I didn’t think I had it in me. I didn’t have the confidence,” she said. For Karen Merritt, it was seeing other women take the lead that spurred her on. She said: “Of course there were men involved too, but the women weren’t leaving the men to do the talking. The more you see that, the more inspiring it is.” Most of the women were prompted to get involved by the Blackpool earthquakes of 2011. A team of European seismic experts had concluded it was highly probable that the two main tremors – magnitude 2.3 and 1.5, plus aftershocks – were caused by Cuadrilla’s drilling operations at the Preese Hall-1 well in Lancashire. Fitton and Mosher, both from Fleetwood, formed a group called FFS No Fracking (Fleetwood Folk Say No Fracking) before joining the Nanas for their occupation last August. Not all of the Nanas are “nanas”, explains Fitton, who does actually have two grandchildren. “We chose the nan image because we like what the Lancastrian matriarch stands for: rolling her sleeves up, getting things done, but still having time for a nice cup of tea,” she said. “Also everyone listens to their nan, don’t they? If you’re in trouble with your nan, you know you’ve gone too far.” On one march she made a banner saying: “Frack with us, Cameron, and the oven gloves are off.” Fearless but always polite, they have proved to be formidable opponents. Marie Taylor, 73, who got involved with the Roseacre Awareness Group (Rag) after the company applied for permission to drill near her house, recalls meeting Francis Egan, Cuadrilla’s chief executive. “I said: ‘Don’t you be thinking you can come to this little village and you’re going to walk right over us – you’re trying to do something that will be very, very difficult to achieve here.’ Years ago we saw off plans to build a service station in Roseacre, I told him. He just looked at me as if to say: ‘stupid woman.’” As Barbara Richardson, Rag’s chair, puts it: “They completely underestimated the scale of the opposition.” What characterised all of the actions and protests by these women was that they were peaceful and, they would argue, lawful. They believe their gender played a key role in their success. “Women are patient, aren’t they?” said Davies. “We always knew this would be a slow burn.” Rothery argues that men are blinded by technology. “Men love things that go vroom. Fracking is toys for boys.” Being an older woman – she’s 53 – was an asset, she said. “I think with age you realise it’s not about looking good but acting from the heart. You reach a point where you don’t care what other people think about you.” Pam Foster, who is in her 60s, said the pro-fracking campaigners tried to use their age against them. “At the start people would say: ‘Oh, you’re all old. You’re going to die soon. Leave the jobs for us.’” But the women were undeterred, spurred on by each other and history. During the Preston New Road occupation last year, Janice Buckley, 55, said she was confident they would win. She said: “Women have done it before – I don’t see why women can’t do it now. Don’t forget the suffragettes.” They might have won the battle at Lancashire county hall, but the Nanas are not putting their tea sets away yet. “We don’t want to lose this momentum – or our friendships,” said Foster. The women want to put their might behind community renewable solutions, such as solar energy. They also know that Cuadrilla may well appeal against the decision, and have pledged to support groups in other counties should energy companies apply to frack there. “We know that the government is all out for shale and we are all out to stop them,” said Mosher. “We will keep dusting off our tabards and waving our feather dusters.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2013/dec/17/haiti-solar-power-sustainable-electricity-solution","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-17T15:08:12Z","webTitle":"Haiti switches on to solar power as sustainable electricity solution | Rashmee Roshan Lall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/haiti-solar-power-sustainable-electricity-solution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/haiti-solar-power-sustainable-electricity-solution","fields":{"headline":"Haiti switches on to solar power as sustainable electricity solution","bodyText":"Mirebalais is just an hour's drive north-east of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, but in terms of technological distance travelled, the town might as well be on another planet. On moonless nights, much of the capital is dark; its shacks and makeshift roadside stalls are lit only by flickering candles or small kerosene lamps. It could hardly be otherwise in a country where only about 20% of the 10 million population are estimated to have access to electricity, the lowest percentage in the Caribbean. But Mirebalais is home to a new, well-lit public hospital that can hum with activity round the clock. Seven months after the world's largest solar hospital opened its doors, its 1,800 rooftop solar panels have generated enough energy to charge more than 19,000 electric cars, run six surgical suites, attend to 60,029 patients and safely deliver more than 800 babies. \"The number of deliveries is a pretty substantial fact considering that approximately three-fourths of women in rural Haiti give birth at home. The hospital is helping to meet a substantial unmet need,\" said Jeff Marvin, of Partners in Health, which built the Mirebalais facility in partnership with Haiti's health ministry. For Haiti, the hospital is a shining symbol of what the future might look like, powered by the island's plentiful sunshine. More than 60% of electricity generation is unsustainably based on imported diesel, mainly from Venezuela. The overwhelming majority of Haitians rely on charcoal and wood for fuel, contributing to rampant tree-felling that has reduced forest cover to the perilous level of 2%. The search for cleaner, greener alternatives has become increasingly urgent. This is driving an initiative to literally light up Haitian lives, especially in poor off-grid areas such as the camps that sprang up around Port-au-Prince after the devastating 2010 earthquake, as well as deep in the rural hinterland. A consignment of 12,000 WakaWakas (Swahili for shine bright) solar lamps, made by a Dutch company, arrived in October after a 10-month \"buy one, give one\" campaign, mainly in the US. They are being distributed free or for symbolic recompense in the form of community service through a network of non-governmental organisations identified with help from the Clinton Global Initiative. \"This is the biggest endeavour that has brought high-quality personal, portable and self-sufficient solar LED lighting to Haitian families,\" said Elanna Veldkamp, of Off-Grid Solutions, which manufactures the lamps in China. \"The scale of this campaign provides for a real and lasting change.\" It is a bold claim, but even sceptics with experience of similar, if scattered, smaller-scale solar initiatives agree there is one crucial difference – the plan to make the WakaWaka lamps in Haiti. Veldkamp said the Haitian government's enthusiasm led to a memorandum of understanding in June for large-scale local assembly, and eventually local manufacture, of the products. If WakaWaka's plans for local manufacture work out, it could be a crucial turning point. \"Solar lamps are old news and the majority sold around the world have been subsidised after manufacture in China,\" said Patrick Delaney, an American engineer who sold 10,000 solar lamps in Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama and a clutch of African countries through his largely self-financed non-profit company. But even he agrees that local manufacture might upscale the sustainable provision of lamps across Haiti's hinterland. \"What's new in 2013 is that wages are rising in China, less stuff will be manufactured there, so helping the local economy in Haiti by manufacturing them here would be the way to go,\" he said. Already, the WakaWakas are making a huge difference, says John Winings of the Comprehensive Development Project (Codep), which plants 1m trees a year in Léogâne, west of Port-au-Prince. Codep has received about 1,200 WakaWaka lamps for its 1,400-strong community and as payment it will plant an extra 50,000 trees this year. Winings said it was a bargain. \"A personal solar light suits Haitian cultural proclivities. Solar power-generating plates are very easily stolen. Instead, you want something that you can use and put inside at night.\" For Olkins Antoine, 19, a student from Cité Soleil, one of the capital's tougher neighbourhoods, the lamp means a lot. \"Now I can see my way when I walk home at night … If someone tries to mug me, I can blind him with my light and run away. And, best of all, I can study for my exams – even after 5pm when it gets dark,\" he said. Solar energy is definitely the future for Haiti, says Daniel Schnitzer, whose non-profit EarthSpark International plans to expand the country's first prepay micro grid with a 100-kilowatt solar power system to cover all of Les Anglais town centre in southern Haiti by June. Though Schnitzer is talking about large solar installations – 25 micro grids nationwide, with the Haitian government's blessing– his Eneji Pwop brand (clean energy in Creole) plans to stock WakaWakas for sale as well. The outlook for solar-powered solutions may have just got brighter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/05/worlds-first-solar-cycle-lane-opening-in-the-netherlands","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-05T10:45:57Z","webTitle":"World's first solar cycle lane opening in the Netherlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/05/worlds-first-solar-cycle-lane-opening-in-the-netherlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/05/worlds-first-solar-cycle-lane-opening-in-the-netherlands","fields":{"headline":"World's first solar cycle lane opening in the Netherlands","bodyText":"The bike path that connects the Amsterdam suburbs of Krommenie and Wormerveer is popular with both school children and commuters: around 2,000 cyclists ride its two lanes on an average day. But next week Krommenie’s cycle path promises to become even more useful: on 12 November a 70-metre stretch will become the world’s first public road with embedded solar panels. Costing around €3m (£2.4m) and funded mostly by the local authority, the road is made up of rows of crystalline silicon solar cells, encased within concrete and covered with a translucent layer of tempered glass. A non-adhesive finish and a slight tilt are meant to help the rain wash off dirt and thus keep the surface clean, guaranteeing maximum exposure to sunlight. Since the path cannot be adjusted to the position of the sun, the panels produce roughly 30% less energy than those fixed on to roofs. Nonetheless, when the path is extended to 100 metres in 2016, its creators hope that it will produce enough energy to power three households. The Netherlands’ TNO research institute, which developed the concept behind the solar bicycle path, think the potential of their idea doesn’t stop there. Sten de Wit of the institute told the Guardian that up to 20% of the Netherlands’ 140,000km of road could potentially be adapted, helping to power anything from traffic lights to electric cars. Tests have seen the solar panel units successfully carry the weight of heavy vehicles such as tractors. While Krommenie will become the first community in the world with a publicly accessible stretch of solar road, the idea of using existing road infrastructure to harvest solar energy is gaining momentum across the globe. Two US engineers, Idaho couple Julie and Scott Brusaw, have been developing solar panelling units for road use since 2006. In 2009, their company Solar Roadways received a contract from America’s Federal Highway Administration to build a prototype. In March this year, the Brusaws replaced their own parking lot with solar-panelled units, and thanks to a popular viral video, they have raised $2.2m (£1.4m) to put their design into production. If all the roads in the US were converted to solar roadways, the Solar Roadways website claims, the country would generate three times as much energy as it currently uses and cut greenhouse gases by 75%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/19/uks-biggest-solar-farm-connects-to-national-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-19T16:25:58Z","webTitle":"UK's biggest solar farm connects to national grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/19/uks-biggest-solar-farm-connects-to-national-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/19/uks-biggest-solar-farm-connects-to-national-grid","fields":{"headline":"UK's biggest solar farm connects to national grid","bodyText":"The biggest solar farm in the UK, capable of powering 14,000 homes, has been connected to the national grid in Oxfordshire. The 46MW Landmead solar farm, in East Hanney near Abingdon, is built on low-grade farmland used for grazing sheep, which will remain along with new wildflowers to be planted as part of efforts to improve the site’s biodiversity. In October, Liz Truss, the environment secretary, attacked solar power projects built on farmland, saying they were hitting food production and announced that farmers would lose agricultural subsidies if they allowed solar panels on farmland. Truss’s intervention comes after a decision earlier in the year by the Department of Energy and Climate Change to bring forward the end of the current subsidy regime for large solar farms, with ministers saying they wanted to see more solar on building’s rooftops and less mounted on the ground. Toddington Harper, chief executive of Belectric, the company that co-owns Landmead with First Solar, said the changes did not mean the end of such large-scale projects. “I think the changes to the subsidy scheme have certainly made life more difficult. Having said that, though they have changed the ROC scheme [Renewable Obligation Certificates, the subsidies being phased out], within the Contracts for Difference [the new subsidy scheme], there is still an opportunity to deliver projects like this for the UK,” he said. Harper pointed to Decc surveys that show solar is hugely popular with the public and argued that solar farms – which have been opposed in parts of the country, in some cases by high-profile opponents such as comedian Griff Rhys Jones – had a low impact compared with other forms of energy. “The wonderful thing about solar energy is, from a picture, it looks like a big change, but most people don’t travel around in helicopters. If you are at ground level you can’t even see the solar farm behind the hedge, because it’s 2.2m high. People driving by wouldn’t even know it’s there,” he said. The company has 10 solar farms in the UK, which it says are enough to power 40,000 homes a year, with another 10 in progress, though not on the scale of Landmead which is about 5MW larger than the UK’s previous biggest solar farm. About 200 people were employed during the project’s construction phase. The new farm is built on grade three agricultural land – the middle ranking out of the 1-5 scale for quality of soil – which the company says has a history of not draining well and therefore not good for growing crops. “With Liz Truss, one week she was saying shouldn’t take away land from agriculture use, which isn’t what we’re doing. Then a week later, she published a report about bees, saying they should be treated like Premiership footballers, and that’s exactly what we do [on our solar farms]. We have beehives on our solar farms and plant a lot of wild flowers,” said Harper. Landmead will not carry the title of largest for long – it will be eclipsed by a 49.9MW solar farm at a former RAF site in Norfolk that has been given the planning green light, with construction starting in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2015/dec/03/akon-light-up-600-million-homes-africa-any-questions","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-03T17:01:42Z","webTitle":"Aid is dead: Akon sets out the case for lighting up Africa through business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/dec/03/akon-light-up-600-million-homes-africa-any-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2015/dec/03/akon-light-up-600-million-homes-africa-any-questions","fields":{"headline":"Aid is dead: Akon sets out the case for lighting up Africa through business","bodyText":"That’s all we’ve got time for i’m afraid, but here’s a parting note from Akon: Thank you very much for joining the conversation. With your help the commitments can turn into actions - we’re doing our part by launching the Solektra Solar Academy on 15 December in Bamako, Mali. We have a great time at COP 21, we’re meeting potential partners, we’ve seen interesting commitments being made You can follow the rest of the Guardian’s coverage from the UN climate change summit in Paris here, and here’s a selection of today’s stories The case for aid By email Tom Moore asks: Akon, love the work you’re doing. I believe there is still a place in this sector for aid agencies. Many use the term loosely and still promote business and enterprise. SolarAid for example use grants to help them catalyse markets and reach the very last mile while still selling light and building sustainable markets. There is definitely room for partnerships. Can I ask what you’re doing to ensure the very poorest aren’t overlooked? Many still can’t afford the cost of a home system and need help getting on the energy ladder. Akon replies: I don’t believe in aid in Africa, I don’t believe it works. Aid has been the central point for Africa for years and there has been no progress. If you want to help people you have to empower them, employ them and educate them so that they can provide for their own Constant giving only weakens a person’s morale but if you put people in the position to the be one giving it strengthens them. This project is designed to keep the very poorest out of poverty. ‘East Africa is waiting’ I wanted to be a part of Africa’s development in the future. Just log on akonlightingafrica.com for implementation facts. It is an Pan African project. Democratic Republic of Congo Am just an African citizen doing my part in the development of Africa in general. Unfortunately I don’t have the power to make decision like that. But you on the other hand should spread the information and raise awareness on the issue in Congo. And I will support anyway I can to raise the awareness. Long term vision In the next 10 years Solektra my company wants to be the dominant provider of renewable energy in Africa The trickle down effect The communities need to start by themselves by supporting each others’ businesses. That unity will attract other businesses. We’re working to develop the cheapest microgrid system in the world for the hardest to reach Quad bikes We rented them On music We’re launching it in January but don’t tell anyone ... Working with others … Again we’re a for profit company, promoting public-private partnerships - so we do not work with aid agencies. Will do my best – send the information, I’ll have my people blast it on my social networks Respecting local economies: Also by email Nico Tyabji asks: Many entrepreneurs, local as well as international, are setting up sustainable businesses selling solar lanterns and solar home systems that bring people access to electricity, for less than they currently pay for kerosene and charging phones. It’s a really exciting story for Africa already. How will he make sure he doesn’t kill what’s already happening by giving away lanterns for free? Akon replies: Our pilot projects are “for free” – free equipment but our plan is to participate in official tenders, which will be ‘for profit’ at a later stage. We’re setting pilots in rural areas where people cannot afford lanterns at all – the purpose of a pilot is to showcase the business model We promote the business model for the people that can afford it, at a later stage (the tender phase) Why not use western energy? The truth is: all western companies were approached at the beginning and all declined, so we started ourselves. Now that we managed to draw attention on the issue, everybody wants to work with us! We have partners from all backgrounds and all corners of the world now Where does the money go? Akon Lighting Africa is a program created by a compant, Solektra International that we created with Samba Bathily and Thione Niang. This is a for profit business, so the money goes to the banks (African banks) and gets re-invested in the projects on the ground. If not through aid, then how should individuals in western countries help? What we do is definitely not aid – it is a for profit business. We want to create jobs. How can western countries help? Come and invest in our projects. See for instance commitments from governments like France to support the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) launched at COP 21 in Paris– this is a good way to help, money for targeted investments Motivation Philbert Girinema sent two questions for Akon by email: Why chose Rwanda as one of the countries to invest? Akon replies: We like Rwanda a lot, we think it is growing fast and thought we could make a good contribution. And what has been your motivation in this initiative? Akon replies: Patriotism for Africa and smart business ... Hi all, Just to let you know that Akon is with us now. Thanks for all the great questions... let’s begin. Laura Stachel, US Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the worst places in the world to be a mother, where a woman has a 1 in 36 chance of dying during pregnancy and childbirth, compared to 1 in 2,300 in the developed world. The causes of death, including obstructed labour, are often easy to treat but emergency C-sections and other procedures are almost impossible to perform in the dark. In 2008, Laura Stachel, an obstetrician-gynaecologist from California, came up with a solution to help overstretched midwives: a “solar suitcase” for health centres that suffer regular power cuts. The idea for We Care Solar was born after a research trip to Nigeria, where she found a state hospital, serving a city of 1.5 million people, surviving without electricity for 12 hours a day. “I saw mothers fighting for survival in near-darkness, nurses trying to start intravenous lines by candlelight, deliveries by kerosene lanterns, and surgeons who were conducting C-sections by flashlight,” Stachel explains. She and her husband raised funds for a comprehensive solar electric system in the labour room, operating theatre and a blood bank. The hospital’s maternal death rate dropped by 70%. Within a year they’d adapted this into a portable solar-powered kit, which included head torches, medical lights and Doppler baby heart monitors. So far 1,300 have been distributed across Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Liberia, Malawi and Sierra Leone. The pair want to equip midwives across Africa with 20,000 lifesaving kits by 2018. Namubebo Akombaetwa, Zambia Namubebo Akombaetwa grew up in Luanshya, in Zambia’s Copperbelt Province, and remembers visits to her grandmother well. “She used kerosene lamps and at the end of every holiday I’d look at the ceiling and notice how black it was from the fumes. “Over time that causes respiratory problems [like asthma and bronchitis] – the same as you might get from constant smoking.” Fast forward to today and 30-year-old Akombaetwe is explaining how, as a development graduate, she saw a job advert for SunnyMoney, the social enterprise arm of UK-based charity SolarAid, which said it wanted to eradicate the use of kerosene lamps by the end of 2020. “I realised energy was as important to development as economics,” Akombaetwe said. “I live in a country where so many people are off-grid and I thought I should do my part giving people access to clean, safe and affordable lighting.” She sells small, portable five watt solar lights that charge in the sun and last for up to 72 hours. They have a five-year lifespan and cost around $5, which is an affordable option for their clientele, subsistence farmers on an average annual farming income of $163. Francis Kibhisa, Tanzania “Africa has an abundance of sunshine ... east Africa in particular is in a tropical zone,” says Francis Kibhisa. “Hydro, biofuels, gas and oil are all diminishable but sunshine is the one reliable source Africa can depend on.” The 45-year-old off-grid expert set up Rex Energy in in 2000, specialising in solar solutions. They are one of Africa’s only solar companies founded, owned and run by Africans. The company offers a vast array of products, from complete home solar systems capable of powering lights, televisions, electric shavers, laptops and mobile phones, to mini-solar grids producing up to 500kw of energy that consumers can tap into, instead of the national grid. Most of Kibhisa’s customers are farmers and fishermen who can pay by text message, to suit their irregular incomes. “The solar industry went through big problems during the European and American recession, with many giant companies losing a lot of money and declaring bankruptcy,” Kibhisa said. “But we got through it and investment is coming back. “What we need now is to come up with innovations for storing the energy we produce , he says, but we have a big future ahead of us.” Dr Lazare Sebitereko, Burundi Dr Sebitereko grew up in South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where bamboo and firewood were the main sources of light at night. Today he is in charge of ambitious plans for Burundi’s first major solar plant. It is a 17-hectare, 7.5 megawatt (MW) farm, 65 miles from the capital Bujumbura. “Burundi is one of the world’s poorest countries but with a lot of potential,” he explains. “It’s very expensive to connect people to the national grid [and] the solution are alternatives like solar.” The plant will increase Burundi’s energy capacity by 15% in a country where just 4% of the population of 10 million has access to electricity. It will employ 300 Burundians, 30% of whom will be women. Construction is set to begin next year, but there are fears that the project could be derailed after an attempted coup in May. Sebitereko hopes that the project will improve the education system and lift people out of poverty by giving local economies a boost: “I never had access to electricity until secondary school, children today will be able to study ICT.” The world leaders, environmentalists and scientists convening in Paris this week for the UN climate change conference have a challenge on their hands: to secure a global agreement to stop temperatures rising. The African contingent will be some of those pushing hard to negotiate on behalf of millions of nomadic pastoralists and small farmers across the continent, for whom the effects of climate change are being felt most. Across the continent governments are waking up to the fact that Africa’s most abundant natural resource – the sun – can provide clean electricity. Inventors and NGOs are coming up with solar-powered inventions that can charge mobile phones, boost the capacity of national grids or pump water in remote villages.Akon, is one of those hoping to transform the continent’s environmental and economic landscape. As we count down to the live Q&amp;A with the rapper at 4pm, we’ll profile four other men and women making a difference using solar power in Africa. He’s best associated with the dancefloors of R&amp;B clubs, after releasing tracks including Lonely, Smack That and Sorry, Blame it on Me. But Akon is also on a lesser-known mission: to bring electricity to millions of African homes. Electricity is essential to ensuring that businesses stay open; young people can do their homework and public places stay safe, says the Akon Initiative, which the rapper set up in collaboration with political activist Thione Niang in 2014. The enterprise is not about charity handouts, however. Akon has previously told the Guardian he believes foreign aid can hold people back. He prefers a form of development that enables local people to “start developing their own economies”. Any questions? As he prepares to head to Mali later this month to spend time with the continent’s solar energy pioneers, Akon has agreed to answer your questions about electricity, music and his love of Africa.

It’s an old shoe polish factory, converted into an unassuming charity office building, tucked away on a side-street in Vauxhall. The Foundry, designed by 36-year-old Lynton Pepper of small practice Architecture 00, punches well above its weight in both architectural ingenuity and the social impact that it will bring, and was a surprise winner of Riba’s London building of the year award. Developed by the Ethical Property Company, with Barrow Cadbury, Lankelly Chase, Trust for London and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, it provides a new home for 25 different social justice and human rights organisations whose work tackles everything from renters’ rights to solar-energy aid and the rehabilitation of addicted prisoners. Now brought together under one roof, in a loose-fit building specifically designed for discussion, collaboration and exchange of ideas, their work, says the company’s director Susan Ralphs, can be much more than the sum of their parts. And it doesn’t do them any harm to be working in slick new premises that exude a level of gravitas and professionalism greater than the £20 per sq ft rent would suggest. “After just a few months of being here, some of our tenants have already said the building gives an extra weight and confidence to their organisations,” says Ralphs. For just £5.2m, an extraordinarily tight budget for a project of this size, the architects have crafted a place that speaks more of angel-funded start-up incubator than shoestring non-profit hub. “It says something about them to visitors and potential funders,” she adds. “It shows they’re serious.” Ralphs is sitting in the light-flooded atrium carved out between the old factory and the new extension, the gnarled brick wall on one side, opposite the gently zig-zagging timber balustrades of the new office landings on the other. It is an alluring space that has the as-found feel of a leftover gap between two docklands warehouses, a backyard of sorts where people naturally congregate and converse. It is dotted with tables to Pepper’s own design, each milled locally from half a sheet of plywood, from an open-source template, making them much cheaper than standard catalogue furniture – and a good deal more beautiful, too. To one side is an open auditorium, with a big glass wall facing onto the street, while an ethical cafe will soon materialise in the foyer to lure people into the building, along with a public programme of arts and educational events organised by energetic local outfit Gasworks, who are also now tenants of the building. The Lilian Baylis school – once one of the country’s worst performers, now Ofsted outstanding in everything – stands across the road, and Ralphs is keen for their agendas to overlap, with a programme that addresses the entire community: “We are conscious that the building shouldn’t just be an oasis of Guardian-reading types.” Pepper’s description of the project is as straightforward as the budget was tight. “It’s basically a series of concrete shelves that you can put stuff on,” he says. The floors are arranged as long horizontal slabs that protrude beyond the facade line and extend at either end to provide a series of outdoor terraces screened with metal mesh, like the decks of a brutalist cruise ship. The windows are cleverly angled, so as to direct views away from the residential neighbours, and are framed with “champagne-anodised” aluminium, bringing a touch of spartan glamour alongside the raw concrete. What looks like a cluster of garden sheds sits on the roof, with a pitched silhouette that echoes the industrial building behind, providing a trio of meeting rooms that can be used by tenants and hired out for events. It is designed so you could simply add another shed if needed, while the outdoor terraces – which also double-up as the escape route – will be used for touchy-feely things such as community gardens, bicycle repair workshops and bee-keeping. Inside, it is a model of how a tiny budget can go a long way. The concrete soffits are left exposed, saving money on expensive ceilings and providing good thermal mass – just one of the reasons the project achieved an “excellent” environmental rating by BREEAM. There are recycled carpet tiles that look brand new (“probably from the kind of office in the City that changes its carpet every month,” says Pepper), a limited number of standard details for all the main junctions, to make the job easier and cheaper for the builder, and the chimneys in the old factory have been reused for the new ventilation system. Walking through the building, it is evident that care has been given to every moment, from the kinked landings that provide social working spaces and frame views between the office floors, to the layout of exposed electrical ducts on the ceilings. It has all been designed to Ralphs’ brief: that “it should feel nice, but not too opulent”. For Architecture 00 (pronounced “zero zero”, not double-O, despite having a collaborative structure akin to a collective of special agents – each member free to initiate and work on their own projects and receive due credit), the Foundry joins a collection of small but intelligently formed buildings, including Soar Works and the elegant Manor Works community enterprise centre in Sheffield, which was decreed “Yorkshire building of the year” last year. Known more as strategists and researchers since their foundation 10 years ago, the practice’s recent built projects have grown out of a deep interest in what it terms the “civic economy”. It might all sound suspiciously Big Society (indeed their compendium of community case studies features a foreword by David Cameron), but it goes beyond the hollow rhetoric of providing a civic sticking plaster to cover the gaping wounds of our retreating state. It is founded on faith in the power of collaborative working in fluid “social ecosystems” – which, once you get past the jargon, simply means that people talking and working in the same space produce better results than a world that’s siloed and hidden away behind closed doors. The architects themselves work out of the Impact Hub Westminster, a co-working space they founded and designed, which embodies these thoughts. It is full of a lively mix of social entrepreneurs and it provides an open laboratory for the practice’s many research strands, from an open-source Wikihouse construction system to their emerging plans for a self-build housing revolution. In the Foundry, they’ve put their architectural money where there mouth is, crafting a project that embodies their social rhetoric in beautiful, functional, life-enhancing form."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/feb/25/with-climate-change-us-presidents-matter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-25T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"With climate change, US presidents matter | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/feb/25/with-climate-change-us-presidents-matter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/feb/25/with-climate-change-us-presidents-matter","fields":{"headline":"With climate change, US presidents matter","bodyText":"Yesterday, President Barack Obama became the first president who has taken a stand to stop climate change. Actually, that isn’t quite true. President Obama took that stand from his first step into the White House. He has put into place a series of initiatives that actually give us a chance at stopping the most serious consequences of climate change. Much of his actions have gone with little public notice. That changed yesterday with his veto of the ill-proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Vetoing this pipeline, which would increase the rate of extraction of the world’s dirtiest fuels (bitumen and the byproduct petroleum coke), was a no-brainer for anyone concerned about climate change. In fact, it is not possible to be in favor of the Keystone pipeline if you accept the science of climate change. The reason this story is so big isn’t just about carbon dioxide emissions (although that matters). It is more about the strong stand taken by the President against a well-funded campaign to force the pipeline through. It is also important because of the signal it sends to those intent on long term dirty-fuels extraction. Let’s quickly summarize why the Keystone pipeline was a bad idea to begin with. First, by lowering the production costs, it will increase the rate of extraction of the dirtiest fuels in the world. Second, it will actually raise fuel prices in the United States where much of the tar sands is now sold at a discount. Third, the pipeline will lock in decades of production of dirty fuel even as the costs to deliver wind and solar energy are falling fast and becoming comparable with fossil fuels. Finally, the pipeline would have traversed the United States and would have presented a large spill risk. Why can’t the Canadian government just put the pipeline through their own country? The reason is, their own citizens object. Back to President Obama. His actions on climate change are numerous and significant. As outlined in his Climate Action Plan, his administration has overseen large investments in renewable energy industries in the U.S. that are creating high-pay and high-skill jobs. He has enacted increases in fuel-efficiency standards which not only reduce emissions but also save money. He has worked on international agreements to reduce hydrofluorocarbons and methane emissions, two potent greenhouse gases. Even more significantly, he has overseen the plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the nation’s new and existing coal plants; the EPA’s Clean Power Plan rewards state-level initiatives to find flexible solutions to reduce their emissions. And also significantly, the President has achieved a huge agreement with China to curb and reduce carbon pollution. I spoke with Anthony Swift at the National Resources Defense Council about the Clean Power Plan. He said, The Clean Power Plan and the rejection of Keystone XL go hand in hand in a national policy to reduce our carbon emissions. On one hand, Clean Power Plan is an ambitious proposal to significantly reduce carbon emissions from our existing energy system; while on the other, rejecting tar sands infrastructure projects like Keystone XL ensures that we don’t undermine those reductions by bringing in new, dirtier fuel sources. What does all this mean, and how is it related to Keystone? It means that Obama’s legacy is now cemented. He has done more on climate change than any predecessors, by a long shot. Importantly, he has trusted the science. When we look back on his presidency, this will be what he is remembered for. It also cements the legacy of those who voted in favor of Keystone. It was largely along political party lines; however, in the recent House vote, 29 Democrats voted for the pipeline and one Republican voted against it (Justin Amash), although his reasoning had little to do with climate impacts. I asked Dr. Joe Romm, founding editor of Climate Progress for his thoughts. He responded, Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse. What’s clear is that the oil and gas industry contributed a significant amount of money to congresspersons who voted for the pipeline. According to an article in the International Business Times, “yes” voters received an average $45,000 from the oil and gas industry. Senators who voted for the pipeline received approximately $250,000 from the industry. What is also clear is that as the costs from droughts, floods, more severe storms, and heat waves mount, we can all think back to defining votes like the ones taken in the U.S. Congress this winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/16/global-drought-why-is-no-one-discussing-fresh-water-at-cop21","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-16T11:34:37Z","webTitle":"Global drought: why is no one discussing fresh water at Cop21?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/16/global-drought-why-is-no-one-discussing-fresh-water-at-cop21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/16/global-drought-why-is-no-one-discussing-fresh-water-at-cop21","fields":{"headline":"Global drought: why is no one discussing fresh water at Cop21?","bodyText":"Around the world, fresh water supplies are drying up: California in the US and São Paulo in Brazil are enduring historic droughts, groundwater sources have been plundered in south Asia, and globally more than 750 million people lack access to safe drinking water. The global fresh water shortage is one of the world’s most pressing challenges, yet the issue is not scheduled to be discussed at Cop21 – the UN’s climate change conference – in Paris this December. Those working to deliver water to communities or conserve fresh water sources have a duty to demonstrate ways to adapt to climate change and help policymakers understand the importance of water in a warming world. NGOs, businesses and others working in the sector must build alliances to show how to improve the world’s water problems, such as making the transition to solar energy or planting drought-resistant crops. This was the central message of a panel discussion, organised by the Guardian and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), and sponsored by Fundación Femsa, which creates programmes focused on conservation and the sustainable use of water. The panel discussion was held at SIWI’s annual World Water Week conference. Although Cop discussions have been held for the past 20 years, the issue of fresh water has not been part of the official agenda, even though it is so closely linked to climate change. Water projects that help communities adapt to climate change The panellists suggested that the most effective way for water to be incorporated into climate policy would be through an action agenda where those working in the sector could show governments the types of water projects that could help communities mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. “It’s important to demonstrate initiatives and good examples to drive the process – don’t depend on the decisions being made in Paris,” said Karin Lexén, director of World Water Week, International Process and Prizes. Benedito Braga, president of the World Water Council, agreed: “We need to have interesting proposals of projects on the ground, which means involving not only national governments, but also the private sector and the academic community.” However, there was some debate around whether or not water needs to be included in the resulting climate change agreement from Cop21. “One of the things I’ve seen throughout all these years of Cop talks is that even if the topic is not present [in the text], the water still creeps in,” said Vidal Garza Cantu, director of Fundación Femsa. The language used to talk about climate change was a key theme throughout the discussion. David Tickner, WWF’s head of fresh water programmes, said that while some people do not understand climate change, they do understand floods and droughts. “If we communicated on floods and droughts and their connection to climate change in some areas, that could help our politics.” Encouraging governments and policymakers to look at how water is essential to their biggest priorities, such as energy supply, could also help, said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum. India’s reliance on coal Waughray cited India’s pursuit of energy access through coal as an example. While coal may be the cheapest and most reliable source of energy for India, it is crucial to demonstrate that in the long run, it is not the most sustainable option because of the amount of water needed. “How secure is your coal plan when you’ll need an awful lot of water to cool all those power stations?” said Waughray, demonstrating how to present the issue to officials. “In the US, 26% of installed capacity for coal is in water-stressed areas, and look what’s happening to them right now – they are close to blackouts in some states. Is that where you want to be?” This highlighting of the risks of using water so recklessly has encouraged action in the private sector. “We have looked at our business risk and understood how climate change and water issues are going to change how we do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, and impact on our profitability” said Ellen Silva, senior manager of applied sustainability at General Mills. “I would call out to corporations to be transparent about your risks. Face them and you’ll find partners lining up to work with you and solve those problems.” Tickner, however, urged caution around using risk terminology, saying that while it resonates with the private sector and governments, opportunities must also be talked about. “What are the opportunities here for governments and business to do things better? Opportunity terminology can also be very powerful,” he said. Waughray agreed: “The risk issue has sunk in. The next stage is opportunity and that’s where this momentum, the alliance-building and the positive engagement about solutions, comes into play.” Collaboration was frequently proposed as a way to see water included in climate change discussions, with many recognising that, in the past, some of the most effective alliances were formed on the sidelines. Waughray cited the New York declaration on forests, a commitment by world leaders to end natural forest loss by 2030 that grew out of the secretary general’s Climate Summit in 2014, as a successful example in the forestry sector. Lexén explained that during the various climate conferences and diplomatic processes over the years, SIWI has tried to stay on the sidelines, talking to people about how they can assist the organisation’s work. “What we’ve seen when we’ve been in the corridors of conferences, is that we get more and more requests from the secretariat to feed into their programmes.” Sometimes, Lexén told the audience, it is more important to be there and be ready to respond to the cause than to ask decision makers: “Please could you put a bit about water in [the Cop21] text?” One alliance the water community could build upon, said Cantu, is with science. “When you get the basics of scientific knowledge and technology in to the discourse on water, you get all the allies that you want,” he said. “It’s important that we pursue knowledge on water to the edge, to share it with other communities and make it available so we can allow other allies to join in a very clear effort.” The issue of finance, and how to obtain funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, was raised by several of the expert panellists. The water sector must reach out to governments that can make changes, support ideas around adaptation, and put the financial resources in place, said Braga: “You have a beautiful declaration, you commit to this and that, but where is the money going to come from?” The goal, he said, is to motivate governments to contribute to a fund that will support poor countries already facing the effects of climate change to become more resilient. Green Climate Fund The chair of the debate, Karl Mathiesen, however, questioned whether or not such a financial mechanism already existed in the form of the Green Climate Fund – a framework established by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – to redistribute money from developed to developing countries, to fund adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Braga said yes, that is the purpose of the fund, but that until now it has focused on reducing carbon emissions and not measures such as building water infrastructure and supporting water governance. Lexén added that throughout the World Water Week conference, she had listened to talks by Héla Cheikhrouhou, executive director of the Green Climate Fund: “I think the message she is conveying is that there’s a decision for the fund to give 50% to adaptation projects and 50% to mitigation projects. But so far, they haven’t received high-quality projects on water so we need to deliver on that.” Tickner stressed the importance of water professionals being involved in the planning and design of any financial mechanisms geared towards funding climate change adaption and mitigation measures. As for the types of initiatives water professionals show to decision makers, Tickner had a range of ideas: “We could show how you can conserve areas such as peatlands or wetlands, which are important carbon sinks. “We could help to show how you can zone river basins to get the maximum sustainable hydropower out of them, without screwing up ecosystems. “We could work on demand management for water. We can show urban spatial planning and its win-wins for water, climate, biodiversity and health. There are 101 things we can do that would be positive, full of great opportunities and will produce mutual benefits. “If bad mitigation or adaptation projects get funded, they can have really negative trade-off effects,” he said. “So we need to get in there and ask how can you design a project where: those trade-offs are transparent; there is an equitable process for making decisions about what gets approved and what doesn’t; and as many win-win projects are funded as possible.” On one viewpoint the panel was unanimous: that Cop21 is not the end of efforts to get water included in climate change talks. “This is just part of a process,” said Braga. “We should not think only of one single event – it’s a process that moves forward.” Water scarcity and climate change debate: at the table Karl Mathiesen (Chair) Environmental journalist, the Guardian Benedito Braga President, World Water Council Dominic Waughray Head of public-private partnerships, World Economic Forum Karin Lexén Director, World Water Week, International Processes and Prizes, SIWI Ellen Silva Senior manager, applied sustainability, General Mills David Tickner Head of fresh water programmes adviser, WWF Vidal Garza Cantu Director, Fundación Femsa Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

What caught his eye was not the text itself, but the full-page colour illustration of Spider-Man that accompanied it. Intrigued, Karp sat down and started reading. The article detailed how a group of researchers had created a new synthetic material by mimicking the properties of gecko feet – whose tiny, hair-like pillars allow the lizard to stick to and detach from apparently sheer surfaces with ease. Imagined uses for the material included gloves that would allow military personnel to climb up the sides of buildings, just like Spider-Man. “The wheels in my head started turning,” Karp told me recently. His first thought was to use the material to create a new type of medical tape that could replace sutures and staples, which can damage sensitive tissue surrounding wounds. Karp was working alongside the world-renowned bioengineer Robert Langer at the time, studying ways to create biodegradable materials that could seal wounds inside the human body. The tape could even go a step further than sutures or surgical staples, he thought, and be used in particularly intricate surgical procedures – for instance, tying together the small intestine during gastric bypass surgery. The next morning, Karp stopped by Langer’s office and convinced him that he had come up with the perfect idea to win a prestigious research grant. But as he began his research, Karp found that it wasn’t enough to simply rely on friction between the hair-like pillars to make the tape stick. That may be how geckos’ feet work, but he was going to need something much stronger if he hoped to bind human tissue inside the body. When he tried coating the surface of the tape with a glue, Karp found that it seeped in between the pillars, like honey drizzled on to a hair brush. Next, he played around with the position of the pillars on the surface of the tape, placing them closer together. That didn’t work either – when the pillars were too close together, there wasn’t enough friction with the surface of the tissue. So he moved them apart again, and then tried coating each individual pillar with the glue, instead of simply brushing it over the top. Now, whenever the tissue came into contact with a pillar, it stuck in place. Finally, Karp had his solution. “It was a great example of a holistic approach to problem-solving,” David Kaplan, chair of the biomedical engineering department at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told me. In 2008, MIT’s Technology Review magazine named Karp one of the top innovators in the world under the age of 35. Karp, who is now 40 and runs his own lab at BWH, is what is known in the business as a bioinspirationalist – a person who looks to nature for solutions to scientific problems. The gecko tape was Karp’s first bioinspired invention; these days he is regarded as a leading figure in the field. (He often tells people that he owes his success to Spider-Man – there’s a large drawing of the Marvel superhero in his office, and he once wore a Spider-Man T-shirt during a TEDMed talk.) Karp’s current projects include surgical staples inspired by porcupine quills, which create smaller punctures in the skin and prevent bacteria from entering wounds, and a new kind of surgical glue inspired by the sticky secretions of marine worms, which is strong enough to bind moving tissue inside major organs, such as the heart. This last invention has helped to cement Karp’s reputation as a rising star in the world of bioengineering. Because he doesn’t just invent cool stuff – he turns his creations into actual products. “When we look to solve problems, it’s not so we can publish papers and get pats on the back from the academic community,” said Nick Sherman, a research technician at Karp Lab. “It’s more like, ‘Is this work going to help patients? If not, how do we make it help them?’” Earlier this year, Karp’s surgical glue began a human clinical trial in Paris. It is the first of Karp’s innovations to advance this far. Unlike other surgical glues on the market, his actively repels blood, making it ideal for sealing holes in blood vessels, intestinal tissue, even bone. It is also much sturdier, meaning that surgeons could use it to fix cardiac defects without the need for open heart surgery. “This could completely transform how we perform surgery,” said Jean-Marc Alsac, the cardiovascular surgeon at the Hospital European Georges-Pompidou in Paris who is overseeing the trial. * * * Karp Lab, which opened in July 2007, is hidden behind a heavy white door on the third floor of an office building in Cambridge, near Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Inside, a stockpile of white lab coats hangs near the entrance, and beyond lies a jigsaw puzzle of heavy machinery, vials, tubes and jars, sanitising stations and discarded rubber gloves. “Lots of labs are doing what appears to be similar work but, truly, they are not in [Karp’s] league,” Arnold Caplan, a professor in the department of biology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, told me. Every Wednesday at 8am, staff meet in a large conference room to discuss ideas. The lab employs around 25 staff, from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows, although its ethos is strictly non-hierarchical. One research trainee, Thomas Kuncewicz, joined Karp Lab just over a year ago, before finishing his undergraduate degree, and is now leading two projects. “Everyone’s experience is different – and that’s what matters most here,” he told me. “Not some dumb pyramid scheme where we have to work our way up through the ranks.” Lab employees are encouraged to email Karp whenever they have a question or idea. “If you ever email him, within five minutes you’ll have a response,” Kuncewicz said. “It can be 11pm or 3am, and he’ll reply.” (I have exchanged emails with Karp long past midnight. His average response time is about 10 minutes.) The lab attracts the kind of budding scientist who won’t turn up their nose at the occasional lab outing to the zoo or the aquarium. A couple of years ago, one of Karp’s students returned from a field trip with a handful of porcupine quills. At the time, Karp was in the middle of designing a new type of surgical staple, which are most often used in surgery to close sensitive wounds that cannot be sutured by hand. Karp looked closely at the quills and noticed that each had multiple tiny barbs on the end of its tip, like a serrated knife. He took a few quills and stuck them in his chin to test how much force would be required to puncture the skin, and how much it would hurt. (“Surprisingly little,” he said later.) Over the next few months, Karp designed a surgical staple with serrated ends, like the quills. He tested it on raw chicken and found it slid in easily, and created small, clean holes that caused virtually no damage to the surrounding tissue. The staples that are currently in use cause large punctures in surrounding tissue – which allow more bacteria to enter the wound and cause infection. Karp Lab patented the staple and is working on getting it to market. Karp believes that the invention could significantly reduce post-surgery complications, which are often caused by current surgical staples. For Karp and others in his field, nature often holds the key to critical scientific and medical problems. This approach also gives scientists free access to a vast number of solutions that have already benefitted from millions of years of trial-and-error testing. The appeal of bioinspiration, for Karp, lies in the idea that “every living creature that exists today is here because it tackled a number of challenges. And those that haven’t have quickly become extinct,” he said. “In essence, we are surrounded by solutions. Evolution is truly the best problem-solver.” “A distinct advantage of the bioinspiration route is that pre-existing solutions are somewhat handed to us,” Leif Ristroph, an assistant professor of mathematics at New York University’s Courant Institute, told me. “Of course we have to figure out the mechanisms behind the solution, and determine which parts we care to mimic and which do not carry over to our problem of interest. The leaf as nature’s solar panel is a great example: scientists have been trying to better understand photosynthesis for a long time, even well before we wanted to collect and store solar energy ourselves.” In recent decades, advances in technology, engineering, and robotics have made it easier to observe nature and borrow from it with more precision than ever before. In the early 2000s, Japan Railways Group, which operates the Shinkansen bullet train, asked one of its engineers, Eiji Nakatsu, to come up with a way to fix a longstanding problem. Whenever the train went through a narrow tunnel at high speed, the atmospheric pressure created low-frequency waves that spread out from the tunnel and created vibrations in the air. These vibrations were so powerful that residents 400 metres away from the railway line wrote in to complain about the noise. Nakatsu, who is a keen birdwatcher, wondered if his weekend hobby might provide him with ideas for how to deal with sudden changes in air resistance. His mind turned to the kingfisher, a bird whose long and flat beak allows it to dive from the air (low resistance) into water (high resistance), with a minimal amount of disturbance so as not to alert its prey. Nakatsu redesigned the nose of the Shinkansen 500-Series, making it longer and flatter. The new design successfully reduced air pressure by 30%. The story of Nakatsu and the Shinkansen is a favourite among advocates of bioinspiration. Many of the world’s top academic institutions – Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, and Columbia – now offer courses in bioinspired engineering, while organisations such as the World Biomimetic Foundation and the Biomimicry Institute have been established specifically to help spread the word by highlighting the work of companies who dabble in bioinspired design – an electricity-free ventilation system modelled on termite mounds, for instance, or wind turbines with aerodynamic bumps similar to those found on a humpback whale’s flippers. Still, even those who believe that bioinspiration may hold the key to solving humanity’s most urgent problems – water scarcity, overpopulation, climate change – are careful to point out that the field is still in its infancy. Beth Rattner, the executive director of the Biomimicry Institute, told me: “We can observe and make mathematical replications of a kingfisher beak on the nose of a train, but we’re still unable to fully emulate or replicate a lot of biological phenomena, either at all or to the point where it’s commercially viable.” “Biomimicry should be considered as a means to understand nature and conceive engineering design, but not as a dogma,” says Maurizio Porfiri, a professor at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. In other words, while evolution has pursued an optimal path – from swimming to flight – this happened in a specific context, with specific constraints. Even Leif Ristroph concedes that he would not, for example, “slavishly copy a bird or insect” in order to design a robot. “Clearly, birds inspired the basic design of aeroplanes, but the early designs with flapping wings did not win out,” he said. Still, Karp is not suggesting that scientists copy nature directly. Instead, he wants to look at what works and improve on it. “The key is to analyse the solution evolution has converged on, and then take advantage of those principles in an engineering context,” Adrian Thomas, professor of biomechanics in the zoology department at Oxford University told me. “The obvious mistake is to copy nature – it is possible to do much better than nature by exploiting the best engineering materials.” While research labs dedicated entirely to bioinspiration are rare, Karp’s is not the only one. Don Ingber’s Wyss Institute at Harvard University, which has been running since 2009, is a bioinspiration factory. There are some 375 full-time staff, who together enjoy more than $600m in grants and philanthropic funding. The lab has co-founded 15 startups in the last three years, and has more than 15,000 patents out for a range of bioinspired technology and designs across a range of disciplines, from medicine to robotics. They include a self-organising swarm of tiny robots that can be used for tasks such as surveillance, traffic monitoring and crop pollination, and a mattress that senses the cardio-respiratory functions of infants and can help detect when they are having trouble breathing. “Jeff has done amazing stuff in his lab,” Ingber told me. “But we can do it much faster. We’re able to take much bigger risks here, and we’re more likely to succeed, both technically and commercially.” But sheer volume is not Karp’s aim. When the lab first opened, Karp thought he might use bioinspiration to tackle problems around cell migration, the process whereby cells move around an organism to aid in tissue formation, wound healing and immune response. That same year, after speaking at a biomedical conference to drum up support for the lab, someone approached Karp and told him bluntly that the only interesting thing about his talk was the gecko tape. “That’s all people asked me about,” Karp told me. “So that got me thinking, maybe I should just focus on medical devices. It seemed to be the thing that got people excited.” * * * One evening in August 2009, Karp received an email from Pedro J del Nido, a specialist in cardiac surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital. Del Nido was having difficulty sealing holes in the hearts of young patients suffering from congenital heart defects. Whenever Del Nido tried to suture a hole, the surrounding tissue would tear. He had read Karp’s paper on the gecko tape, and wondered if Karp could help him design something similar to help treat his young patients. This presented a new challenge for Karp. While the gecko tape can seal things like tissue and gastrointestinal tracts, the heart is not stationary. It moves very fast and violently, as blood constantly gushes in and out. Any adhesive would have to be strong enough to resist being washed away in the deluge. Karp wondered if a surgical glue might help solve Del Nido’s problem. Gluing internal surgical wounds is quicker and sometimes more effective than stitches, particularly around sensitive areas where any rip or tear in the skin will damage surrounding tissue. But Karp did not know any surgical glues that could work successfully in the presence of a lot of blood, and none that are strong enough to actually bind moving tissue. What’s more, surgical glues sometimes have harmful side-effects (such as releasing formaldehyde inside the body) and can take as long as 30 minutes to set. As any surgeon will attest, the less time a patient lies on the operating table with their insides exposed, the better. Karp told Del Nido that he would try to come up with something. Except, he didn’t really know how. The gecko tape had been an academic invention. There had been one animal trial – on mice. Del Nido needed something practical that he and his surgeons could actually use when operating on children. Karp realised that if he was going to help Del Nido, he had to talk to some people who had experience turning inventions into products. “One of the reasons most medical devices invented in an academic environment never make it to patients is because they’re so complex and you can’t manufacture them at the right scale, or at the right price,” Karp told me. “The lab is really just the first step.” Karp decided that he would need to build his own network of contacts: entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, patent attorneys, regulatory body contacts, consultants, and business managers, who would be familiar with his methods and guide him on every step of the process. He spent the next two years meeting with venture capitalists around Boston, attending networking events sponsored by local law firms, consulates and biotech companies. He flew around the country presenting his work to various companies. “I wanted to make it in such a way that as soon I came up with an idea, all I’d have to do is just fire off an email to the right person and that would be it,” he said. * * * One morning in late June, I accompanied Karp on a visit to the New England Aquarium in Boston. Scientists have a reputation for being slightly awkward, but Karp is at ease in his own skin. Tall, with a lean build and slight stubble, he peppers lengthy scientific explanations with jokes, usually at his own expense. “Stop me if I get too boring,” is something he says often. He is fond of drawing diagrams to explain what he is talking about. “He’s one of those very rare scientists who can talk to everyone at their level,” Sherman, the Karp Lab research technician, told me. “How he talks to high-schoolers is different from how he talks to PhD fellows, and that’s different to how he talks to physicians. But it’s always at the same level of excitement.” Karp grew up in Peterborough, a rural county in Ontario in a Frank Gehry-designed house that his parents bought from a local builder. The family moved in when Karp was eight; it was his first time living outside the city. There was a buffalo farm across the road, and a sheep farm next door. There was a creek running through the backyard, and the property backed on to a forest. “I would wake in the middle of the night,” said Karp, “and there would be a pack of wolves on my front lawn – headed to the sheep farm for a snack!” Karp began taking trips into the woods, looking for snakes. Later, he would mount expeditions to trap frogs and snapping turtles by the creek. He got used to seeing foxes on the driveway at dusk and listened out for the hoots of the great grey owls nesting nearby. “For a kid with no appreciation of nature, this was a really big turning point for me,” he said. “It was like, here was this whole new world I never even knew existed.” Inside the aquarium, Karp led me to a large, fluorescent tank filled with lion’s mane jellyfish, one of the largest species, with a bell-shaped hood that can reach eight feet in diameter and tentacles that can stretch over 100 feet. “The key thing to remember is that the problem comes first, not the solution,” Karp said, peering inside the tank. “We don’t sit in front of the jellyfish tank and think, ‘How can we design a medical device that does what these jellyfish do?’ It’s more like, we have a problem we need to solve, and these floating piles of jelly might be able to help us.” A few years ago, Karp began looking at jellyfish to try and improve the design of a blood analysis device that can detect whether a cancer has metastasised after the removal of a tumour. Devices like this already exist: they resemble a small, rectangular chip roughly the size of a sim card. The blood flows through the top part of the device, while the bottom is lined with antibodies, which attach to any cancerous cells present in the sample. By looking inside the chip under a microscope, it is possible to determine if any cells have been “captured” – and therefore if the blood sample contains cancerous cells. An early problem with these devices was that the blood sample flowed too fast and too far above the antibodies, which meant that even when cancerous cells were present, they were not always detected. Later versions of the device shortened the distance between the top and bottom, but this meant that the blood sample had to be smaller, which in turn meant the results were less accurate. (The bigger the sample size, the more accurate the results.) Karp wanted to know if there was a way to force the cancerous cells to slow down and better attach to the antibodies. So, instead of lining the bottom of the device with antibodies, Karp created synthetic jellyfish-like tentacles made out of DNA. The tentacles, which are roughly one-tenth the width of a human hair, are imbibed with a capturing agent that targets circulating tumour cells, and can extend to “grab” them. In tests of an early prototype, Karp found that his new design could increase the flow of blood by 10 times, making it far more likely that cancerous cells would be accurately detected. We had moved downstairs to the aquarium’s cafe by the time Karp had finished laying all this out, and when I expressed some confusion about some of the details, Karp grabbed a napkin from a nearby table and retrieved a pen from his bag. It was in the shape of a bright orange crab claw. “What?” he said, in reference to my amused expression. “I think it’s funny. I got it from a souvenir shop.” He then proceeded to draw a diagram of his device on the napkin. (Karp’s business card features a very similar drawing of the tentacles, and a picture of jellyfish on the back, to show the process from inspiration to creation.) “Now,” Karp said, leaning in conspiratorially. “You want to touch a stingray?” * * * In early 2011, Karp asked one of his graduate students, Maria Pereira, to help find a solution to the challenge that Pedro del Nido had set him: namely, how to seal holes in children’s hearts. “We tried to define the key criteria for the problem: a material that couldn’t be washed away by blood, was easy to deliver and minimally invasive,” Pereira told me. “Something that a surgeon could control.” Following Karp’s example, Pereira looked to the natural world for solutions. She held lab meetings and asked everyone to email her ideas or pictures of creatures that live in especially wet environments. People circulated photos of slugs and snails. “We began thinking, how do snails stay attached to leaves when it’s raining?” Karp told me. “Why aren’t the trails they leave behind washed away by the rain? What are those secretions made of?” One day, someone emailed Karp and Pereira a link to a research paper on sandcastle worms, which live in shallow water on the Californian coast. The worms secrete a sticky, viscous goo that they use to build underwater shelters by gluing together bits of shells and sand grains. The goo is also hydrophobic – meaning it repels water – to ensure the shelter withstands the force of waves. Slowly, Karp and Pereira began to imagine a product that would not only be used to treat small internal wounds in children, but that would have wider applications. They now envisioned a liquid surgical glue, strong enough to work in any major organ. It would be both biodegradable and capable of repelling blood and water. In 2013, Karp co-founded Gecko Biomedical in Paris with the help of Bernard Gilly, the chairman of a group of small French biotech companies. Pereira later moved to Paris to join the company as its head of research. Over the next few years, she and Karp tested different versions of the glue, each with a slight variation in viscosity or adhesive properties. Some versions were too runny and not sticky enough; other prototypes were so sticky they would not spread easily on to tissue. It was not enough to have the glue sit on top of the tissue – it needed to infiltrate it, in order to create a perfect seal that would prevent air or blood from seeping through. Karp thought about how ivy attaches to the sides of buildings – the plant’s “root hairs” seek out crevices and cracks, then secrete a glue that spreads the hairs in different directions. The hairs then shrivel up and dry in a spiral shape, which anchors the plant to its location. “Many of the glue formulations did not work, but the ones that did worked very similarly to ivy, because they were able to burrow into the tissue,” Karp said. Karp and Pereira also developed a device in the shape of a pen, which emits a visible LED ray of light that reacts to the glue, so a surgeon can set the glue once it is applied. (The process takes five seconds.) Each version of the glue was tested first in animal or human tissue inside the lab, and then inside a living organism, usually a rat or pig. The “right” version presented itself entirely by accident. Karp and Pereira set up an animal trial at Boston Children’s Hospital to test a new iteration of the glue: a small, circular patch rather than a liquid version. They created a hole inside the heart of a living rat, and were just about to seal it with the patch when it slipped off. They put it back on top of the hole, but by that point there was so much blood that the patch would not stay in place long enough for Karp to cure it with the light pen. Scrambling for a solution, Karp asked Pereira to scrounge up as much of the most recent batch of liquid glue as she could. Pereira then spread the glue on to a spatula, and applied it to the leak in the rat’s heart. Karp followed with the light, and the glue set. “It did exactly what it was supposed to – it repelled the blood and it remained in place,” Karp said. “We ended up with a perfect seal. This was a massive hole, so showing that we can seal it without sutures or staples was a big deal to us.” (When Karp and Pereira checked up on the same rat six months later, they found no signs of disability or stress. The glue on the animal’s heart had gradually biodegraded as tissue had grown over the patched up hole.) Last spring, Karp showed off the glue during a talk at Zoobiquity, a semi-regular conference that brings physicians and veterinary surgeons together to swap notes. The event took place at the New England Aquarium, and Karp spoke from a semi-raised platform in front of the penguin pool. After the talk, a dental surgeon named William Rosenblad approached Karp to ask if he would be willing to give him some of the glue to use on one of his canine patients, a bulldog named Little Papi. Rosenblad had carried out three unsuccessful procedures to treat an oronasal fistula, a common problem in dogs and cats that results in a large hole in the mouth leading to the nasal cavity. “He looked pretty desperate,” Karp said. “He just said, ‘Get it to me as fast as you can.’” A week later, Rosenblad sealed the hole in Little Papi’s mouth using Karp’s glue. “I knew the real test would come when everything had healed,” Rosenblad told me. Karp was present at the follow-up appointment two weeks later. Little Papi sat patiently while Rosenblad checked inside his mouth, finally declaring that the glue had worked – the hole was sealed. “We all got a bit emotional,” Rosenblad told me. Little Papi’s owner walked up to Karp and shook his hand. “He kept repeating, ‘You changed my life,’” Karp said. * * * In March this year, after successfully raising 22.5m euros, Gecko began a trial of the surgical glue at four hospitals in Paris. The glue was tested on 36 patients, most of whom underwent vascular reconstruction surgery, in which blood vessels are either cut open to remove plaque or enlarged to enable better flow. Jean Marc Alsac, the surgeon overseeing the trial, said that it tested two things: one, how quickly the bleeding stopped when the glue was applied, and two, that there were no adverse effects in patients in the three months after surgery. “It worked immediately,” Alsac told me. “I wasn’t prepared for the surgery to be over that quickly. It was astonishing.” A human trial of the glue is planned for next year in the US. Karp hopes the glue will become part of the surgical armamentarium – available in all hospitals throughout the world – to reduce surgical times and complications of current procedures. He also wants to see it used in surgeries where there are currently no suitable methods to close tissues, such as in minimally invasive procedures where it is difficult to tie knots in small spaces, or where bulky stapling devices cannot fit. “Currently, many surgical procedures are much more invasive than they need to be,” he told me, “but with better ways of sealing tissues in small spaces, this can drastically be reduced.” Making the glue indispensable to surgeons could also help boost bioinspiration’s profile, particularly in medicine. “I think as others see successful examples, they will be more inclined to give it a try,” Karp said. “When I first started out, I didn’t really see bioinspiration as a tool or platform – merely a project. I certainly didn’t realise how powerful it could be.” When I visited Gecko’s headquarters in Paris this summer, I asked Pereira to show me how the glue works. She filled a small syringe with 0.2ml of the glue, which is yellow and gloopy. She took a piece of clear rubber and pressed a small dot of glue on to its surface. “Let’s pretend this is a ruptured vessel inside the body,” she said. She took a thin metal rod and spread the glue around on the rubber surface. She then took the pen light and held it over the rubber for five seconds. “Here,” she said, pushing the rubber into my hands. “Feel it.” The glue had set into a shiny, flexible coating on top of the rubber. I played around with it for a few minutes, then asked Pereira if I could try applying the glue myself. She shook her head, laughing. “You’ll just have to wait your turn like everyone else.” • This article was amended on 25 October 2016.

But energy analysts have told the Guardian that while laudable, elements of the Greens’ climate agenda may be impossible to implement even if the funding floodgates are opened. The Green party’s platform improves on the UK’s current carbon reductions plan, which would see cuts of 80% by the middle of the century. Total decarbonisation would be achieved by doing the heavy lifting in the next 15 years, via a 90% reduction in emissions by 2030 based on 1990 levels. This policy requires the UK to make double the cuts required by EU legislation in the next 15 years. The UK’s current carbon targets are not enough, the manifesto said, to keep the world within the agreed safe level of warming of 2C. The rich, carbon-intensive UK economy must take on a larger share of the burden of emissions reductions than developing nations, it said. To achieve the targets, the Greens would spend £80bn to foster an energy transformation of unprecedented scope. Solar capacity would increase from just over 5GW to 25GW by 2020. To do this it would need to grow faster than in Germany in 2014 during the massive boom inspired by the country’s energiewende transition to renewable power. Offshore wind energy would grow enormously from 8GW to 42GW by 2020 and 60GW by 2030. The Greens said the parameters for this expansion were set in consultation with renewable energy industry professionals. But Rob Gross, the director of Imperial College’s Centre for Energy Policy and Technology, said the Greens’ timeframes may be too ambitious. “I wouldn’t say they are impossible, but you’d really have to be able to put things on a war footing to get to those levels of roll-out in such a short space of time. It would be unprecedented, for offshore wind in particular,” he said. Gross said current pipeline projects have the UK reaching around 10GW of offshore wind by 2020. Jim Watson, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre said increasing this to more than 40GW was likely to be unattainable. “It seems extremely ambitious, just because of the lead times of getting those project up and running. Even were you to throw a lot of money at it now you’d struggle to meet those targets,” said Watson. Solar energy has proven more scaleable, said Gross, but with any such large scale, disruptive push for a certain energy type there is the risk it will increase prices and drive the industry offshore. “Trying to go too far too fast can drive up costs. There’s also a danger that if you want to do this to build UK skills, you can’t actually get those skills quickly enough, so the only way you can hit those targets is by bringing in people from other countries. I’m not against that, but if what you are trying to do is create jobs for people in this country then you need to give those people enough time to get trained,” he said. There was also a question, said Gross, about whether distribution networks could cope with such high levels of decentralised renewable energy - as opposed to the highly-centralised power from coal, gas and nuclear. Gross said the grid in Germany was already experiencing some problems coping with the increasingly fragmented supply driven by the energiewende. “In some respects one would welcome that and in the longer term that might be exactly what we would like to happen. But there’s an adjustment period that’s needed. Building energy infrastructure does tend to take time,” said Gross. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) is responsible for drafting legally binding advice on how the UK can meet its carbon targets. John Gummer, a Tory member of the House of Lords and the chair of the CCC, said the Greens’ manifesto raised important questions about the UK’s climate ambitions, but their timeframes for implementation were fundamentally flawed. “This has to be an evolutionary process, building stage upon stage,” he said. “The Green party is helpful in stretching our ambition but its dogmatic and doom-laden approach will simply not gain enough public support till it’s too late and disaster is upon us. They also carry a good deal of political baggage which distracts from their core environmental message. I admire their tenacity, share their concerns, but doubt their tactics and question their solutions.” Along with their expansion of renewables, the Greens said they would implement a policy of stopping any new nuclear renewable developments (including scrapping the already approved plans for the Hinkley Point C station) and ban fracking for shale gas. Both of these are seen by their advocates as energy sources required for the transition away from coal and eventual decarbonisation. Gross said the Greens position on these energy sources was defensible. “We could do it without nuclear, I don’t see nuclear as being essential to decarbonisation and I think fracking is an irrelevance,” he said. But if their emissions reduction targets were to remain feasible, Gross said the £24bn billpayers are set to pay for Hinkley would have to be redirected towards carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) or developing ways to store energy from the fluctuating supply from renewable sources. Both technologies are currently in their infancy. Watson agreed: “In principle, if you look at modelling and analysis that’s been done you could meet the climate targets that we have now without nuclear. This does place more emphasis on other options like CCS, or a breakthrough in energy storage, but there are uncertainties about these.” Note: the statistics for onshore wind and solar capacity were changed to reflect the latest statistics. The article originally said solar was at 1GW and wind at 1.6GW."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/dec/13/kevin-fong-how-to-survive-in-space-royal-institution-christmas-lectures","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-13T08:30:18Z","webTitle":"How humans will conquer Mars and beyond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/13/kevin-fong-how-to-survive-in-space-royal-institution-christmas-lectures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/dec/13/kevin-fong-how-to-survive-in-space-royal-institution-christmas-lectures","fields":{"headline":"How humans will conquer Mars and beyond","bodyText":"This year the Royal Institution’s Christmas Lectures look at the challenge of human space flight and what it takes to hurl humans into the final frontier on voyages of exploration. As a doctor I spent more than a decade travelling back and forth between the UK and Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, working as a visiting researcher on projects ranging from studying the effects of the space environment on ageing physiology to artificial gravity systems. At the same time I was completing my junior medical training in anaesthesia and intensive care. It was odd trying to splice those two lives together. Working on an intensive care unit overnight, heading to the airport at the end of the shift, grabbing some sleep on the plane, and then arriving the next day in a meeting room in Houston, where people were sitting around talking about how to send people safely to Mars. But the thing that linked the two was the challenge of life at the extremes. In the hospital I was looking at the extremes of life when challenged by disease and injury. At Nasa I was looking at the threat posed to human physiology by the extremes of the physical world and universe. When we talk about extreme environments we can get a rough idea of their austerity by judging how long they will support human life unprotected and unsupported. By that measure space is the ultimate extreme: uniquely hostile to human physiology, it provides no support for human life whatsoever. The unprotected space traveller would survive in that environment merely for a few seconds. You might imagine that there would be plenty for a doctor to do – that when it comes to human space exploration, people who understand and can manipulate human physiology would be at the forefront of that effort. But medical doctors play a poor second fiddle to what is overwhelmingly a culture of engineering – and with good reason. Space flight is in physical principle disarmingly simple. So simple in fact that Newton had begun to understand the dynamics that underpin it nearly 400 years ago. To leave the Earth and enter an orbit around it, you first need to throw an object across the globe so hard that its trajectory extends beyond the Earth’s horizons – so hard that it can be made to fall in such a way that it never again finds the ground. And so to put an object into orbit around the Earth you have to provide it with an enormous amount of energy. In broad terms the faster you go the wider the radius of the orbit you achieve; to get a vehicle to achieve an orbit wide enough to get it to miss both the Earth and the upper layers of the atmosphere, to place you at the same altitude as the International Space Station some 250 miles above us, you need to travel at around 17,500mph. That requires a vehicle propelled by engines and fuel tanks with the explosive capacity of a small nuclear weapon. This journey, from the surface of the Earth into low Earth orbit – aboard the Soyuz spacecraft – takes a little over eight minutes. And so the reason that the culture at Nasa, and space agencies across the world, is so firmly rooted in the demands of engineering rather than those of human biology is because in that brief but violent period there is almost nothing modern medicine can offer in the way of protection. During launch, either the engineering works and everyone lives, or it doesn’t and everyone perishes. The preservation of human life throughout launch depends not upon medical procedures but on concentric layers of artificial protection that engineers design and build and swaddle the astronaut crews in. The rocket engines must fire perfectly, delivering just the right thrust at just the right time, directed in precisely the right way. The tremendous force of that propulsion mustn’t be allowed to shake the vehicle, its systems or its fragile cargo of passengers apart. It is the job of engineering teams to make sure that the launcher and the vehicle are designed to perform in the face of forces that are trying to destroy them. And perched atop that tower of kerosene and oxygen is a tiny capsule, with the volume of a handful of telephone boxes, and a couple of tonnes of supplies and three passengers crammed in among them. That capsule is a tiny bubble of life support, pinched off from the Earth and maintained artificially. Inside, still more machines provide a breathable atmosphere with enough pressure and warmth to support life in the void of space. If you survive the launch, your problems are really only just beginning. International Space Station It’s tempting to think of the International Space Station as a hi‑tech Big Brother house, floating high above the Earth. In some senses that is true: living conditions are harsh by any normal standard. There are few creature comforts and precious little privacy. It is a living arrangement bristling with the potential for huge social conflict. But remarkably that is largely avoided and in 15 years of operation there have been no evictions. But the ISS is much more than an accommodation block. When crews go to live there they are taking up residence inside a machine upon which their lives depend every second of the day. They electrolyse water to produce oxygen, employ molecular sieves to scrub waste gases out of the air that they breathe, run heating systems from vast solar arrays that can pump out 80kW of power. That solar energy also drives four huge gyroscopes, which steady and steer the station, preventing it from tumbling out of control. The International Space Station is far from tranquil: it hums and whines perpetually; fans are running all the time. Without gravity hot air doesn’t rise and cold air doesn’t sink. There is, as a consequence, no convection and without that it’s hard to get air to move or mix. That in turn causes problems, leaving astronauts prone to headaches in poorly ventilated areas, where exhaled carbon dioxide can build up. Hence the constant drum of motors churning air. The draughts on the ISS, like almost everything else that the crews depend upon for healthy living, are artificial. All of this effort just to maintain that bubble of life support in an outpost just 250 miles above our heads. The challenges involved are legion and we haven’t even started to talk about leaving low Earth orbit yet. Back to the moon There is unfinished business on the moon. It is nearly half a century since the Apollo programme landed a dozen men on its surface. And while it represents a treasure trove of scientific discovery, nobody has been back since. Low Earth orbit is 250 miles away and can be reached in minutes. The moon is about 250,000 miles away, takes days to get to and, in addition to isolation and the added complexity of the rocket science required, leaves crews extremely vulnerable to radiation. On Earth we’re protected from some types of radiation by the thick blanket of atmosphere above, which absorbs gamma rays, x-rays and ultraviolet radiation that would otherwise be harmful. But there’s another layer of protection that also keeps us safe: Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetosphere filters out a particularly harmful species of radiation, which comes in the form of charged, high-energy particles – atomic nuclei spat out as a by-product of thermonuclear reactions in stars including our own. This type of radiation is particularly harmful and, during solar flares, can increase in intensity by many thousands of times. Presently we have little in the way of effective protection from the radiation that comes with the worst solar flares. Mars and beyond In recent years the idea of putting human crews on the surface of something other than the moon or Mars has found its way into the strategy documents of the international space agencies. This mission is less science fiction than you might think. The European Space Agenecy’s Rosetta mission, which so spectacularly landed the Philae lander on the surface of a comet last year, showed us that we could find and intercept a tiny target hurtling through space hundreds of billions of miles away. This has given agencies confidence that their idea of landing a human crew on an asteroid might be realisable. But for now it is Mars that lies at the edge of possibility, and surviving that journey presents a challenge on a different scale. With Mars, the problem is distance and time. To get to the red planet you have to traverse hundreds of millions of interplanetary miles; more than 1,000 times the distance Apollo crews travelled to the moon. With existing technology it would take between six and nine months to travel from Earth to Mars and the same again on the return leg. That’s a lot of time spent without any gravitational load on your body. Weightlessness may look like fun, but like everything else, too much of it can be a bad thing. When physiologists first considered what effect the space environment might have on the human body, before anybody had even been into space, they correctly predicted that muscle and bone would waste. Those systems are sculpted by gravity and as anyone who has ever so much as looked at a gym knows, if you don’t use it you lose it. Because of this, crews aboard the International Space Station must subject themselves to a daily programme of resistive exercise to try and prevent some of that bone and muscle loss. Weightlessness wreaks havoc with other systems. It upsets your senses of balance and co-ordination, making it more difficult for crew members to track moving targets, creating illusions of motion and, for the first few days of flight, generally making them feel pretty queasy. With the exception of the nausea, all of these problems tend to get worse the longer you spend weightless. More recently, new – and potentially more worrying – problems have cropped up. For reasons that are not yet entirely clear the pressure in some astronauts’ brains appears to rise as a consequence of space flight, and this has been linked to alterations in their eyesight that sometimes persist for many years after their return to Earth. This phenomenon has only been noticed after long duration missions, which highlights the message: spending a lot of time in space isn’t great for your health. But time also creates problems for life support systems. If you imagine the amount of food, water, oxygen and power a single person might consume in a mission set to last up to three years (if you include the surface stay), that demands quite a sizable larder. Now multiply that by a crew of four or six and it looks like you need an impossibly huge spacecraft just to keep you fed and watered. And that does become impossible unless you are able to recycle and reuse everything you can. Already aboard the space station astronauts recycle most of their waste water, including their urine. They scrub carbon dioxide out of their exhaled air and rebreathe the remaining oxygen. You might be able to go further still, by growing crops hydroponically, as a source of food and a mechanism of removing carbon dioxide and renewing the oxygen supply. If you choose the right plants you might even recycle the nitrogen in human solid waste. Which of course is a scientific way of saying that maybe you could use your own poo to fertilise your life-supporting crops. A system as sophisticated as that is extremely difficult to assemble, manage and maintain, and it’s likely to be a while before we see greenhouses flying through deep space. For now life support engineers will content themselves with finding ways to recycle more and more of the resources they can, and in so doing reducing the amount of payload that crews have to set aside for the things that keep them alive. There is a simple lesson from all of this: space is hard. All frontier endeavours are. But there is plenty to celebrate here. Since the start of the 21st century there has been a permanent human presence in space. What started as a surrogate battlefield for nuclear war has become a multinational programme of science, exploration and collaboration. This is not the place to get into a discussion of why we should explore space at all. There are many benefits that derive from human space exploration but one is more important than all the rest. Human space exploration inspires children to study and pursue careers in science, technology and engineering. It does so by showing them that within the limits of human imagination anything might be possible. I know this because it inspired me and throughout the whole of my life has continued to hold my fascination. It is an enormous honour to give the Royal Institution’s Christmas Lectures. And yes, the take-home message is that space is hard. But the real lesson for this year’s audience is that this has been my adventure and it can be yours too. How to Survive in Space will be shown on BBC4 in three parts on 28, 29 and 30 December at 8pm.

I was very aware as a little girl that I had to claim rights. It is a life story – it only became my job much later. Climate change is an issue of justice. The poorest are the most vulnerable, particularly women. The drudgery of domestic work, of unpaid labour, is getting worse because of climate change. Women’s roles are still quite rigid. Devastation for women who live near coastal regions is harsher, since they generally have less mobility. People can live insular lives in the household and don’t have the information they need to avoid a storm, for example. The other side of the coin is that women are leading in adaptation. They’re finding solutions to the way they do agriculture in order to keep food at home, they are involved in leading responses at a community level. Women’s leadership shines through. [But] only a trickle of governmental money reaches the household, and when it gets there it may be taken by the head of the household. Who inspires me? Solome Mukisa leads a community-based children’s organisation in Uganda. My local government counsellor Beth runs a women’s group. Both are innovative, resilient and strong. Graça Machel. I also admire men like [South African human rights activist] Kumi Naidoo. I hope that adaptation as much as mitigation becomes the norm, that we do development differently: that we factor in the cost to the environment and the cost of women’s work. Mary Robinson, former Irish president and climate campaigner I came to climate change and its undermining of all kinds of rights of poor communities worldwide very late. From 1997 until 2002, as UN high commissioner for human rights, I don’t remember making any speech of any seriousness on climate change because another part of the UN system, the UNFCC, was dealing with it. My foundation is about climate justice. I am encouraged about the women at all levels who want this to work. I’m as inspired by grassroots women like Constance Okollet of Uganda, or Ursula Rakova from the Catoret Islands [in Papua New Guinea], who says there’s nothing she can do about moving her people from the land of the bones of their ancestors. Then there’s good leadership. Christiana Figueres [the UN climate chief] is always positive and never lets it get her down. Some countries seem to want a narrow environmental agenda, like Norway. We need to keep gender in the text, as it’s necessary for good climate policy, because we [have] made mistakes. We had corn for ethanol that drove up food prices, big dams built and people displaced. I have five grandchildren who will be in their forties in 2050, and will share the world with nine billion people. We are the last generation to make decisions. That gets me out of bed in the morning. Remember the injustice of climate change – prioritise that. It’s the passion of my life. Usha Nair, volunteer, climate change programmes, All India Women’s Conference Women experience climate change but don’t know what lies behind it or how to mitigate it. In one village a woman had to go to the field to work at 4am since it was so hot through the day. She used to cook food for the family before going out, get her children ready, care for elders – she can’t do that [now she leaves so early]. We have run programmes related to alternate energy efficiency for almost 40 years, before climate change even existed as a term, in the form of smokeless cookstoves, bio-gas and popularising solar energy appliances – solar cookers, parabolic cookers, water heaters, lanterns. Those are “climate mitigation strategies” now, but when we started that was just a way of helping the women reducing their drudgery and bills. It was hard to find technicians, so with a manufacturer we trained poor women for the assembly, repair and maintenance of solar panels in two slum areas in New Delhi, as well as Dasna Jail, on the outskirts of Delhi. They could earn an income. Women use energy at a domestic level, and have a strong say in the matter, even if the man might have a final say in the house. Vandana Shiva, Indian environmental activist and author There’s only one model for the future – destroy the world’s resources with military rights. The same patriarchal world view that abuses women has violated the earth’s ecological limits by thinking through separation and division. Women are the worst victims of ecological destruction. [Yet] women hold the solutions, both through other ways of thinking about economy, science and technology, and other ways of producing food than industrialised, globalised agriculture. Desertification and land degradation is at the root of conflicts, whether it be Nigeria or Syria. Women live through diversity, they think diversity, they defend diversity. This is the path to sustainability, justice and peace. Aile Jávo, president of the Saami Council, NGO for the indigenous people of Finland, Sweden, Russia and Norway There are six of us Saami women at COP 21, at the frontline of this UN process. The men are home taking care of the reindeer herds. Our rights are often violated in the name of climate change, and adaption and mitigation processes. [Our] reindeer have problems in winter getting food as the temperature shifts; it’s warm and cold, and raining when it’s not supposed to be raining, and the ice is more insecure, which is dangerous for us and them too. There have always been harsh winters but now it’s every year. I’m not hopeful at COP at all, it seems they’re deleting all texts about indigenous people’s rights. I’m disappointed my own country Norway is proposing to delete this from the text. Our traditional knowledge [needs] to be taken into account when it comes to finding out how climate change is affecting us. Dessima Williams, Grenadian diplomat, academic and former UN ambassador It’s fascinating how the idea of injustice is more easily understood when we think about issues affecting women – the lack of water, reduction in agriculture, and the crisis we face now in mosquito-born diseases and invasive species – women highlight that these are increasing. Most think of climate change mainly as pollution, but it has a big effect in the social sector, in health, education and agriculture. Women change the agenda towards the social elements of agreements – there’s the science, economics, politics, diplomacy, but the women’s movement made issues of hunger and poverty a main analytic pillar of the agreement. I fought a battle and still do to get that accepted among delegates and key negotiators. In finance, I heard a senior EU minister complain that governments tend to ask for major mitigation projects like airports, dams or forest preservations, but that women and NGOs ask for things closer to people like cookstoves. [At the local level] is where climate change hits the hardest, where it’s best understood and can best be prevented. [We must] get the gender balance right so that women have an equal shot in the decision-making process. Helen Hakena, director of Leitana Nehan Women’s Development Agency, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea I’ve been working with women from the Cartaret Islands, the world’s first climate refugees, who have lost islands and been relocated. We have a matrilineal culture so when the sea erodes land, women lose their inheritance, their children’s futures and cultures and traditions, because everything we do is about land. I work with the women who were tired of waiting for the government’s relocation programme. They migrated on their own, searching for husbands who [had] left for work and [had] since remarried. Gender-based violence has increased, and poverty. We have a militarised society; they’re scared. Bougainville went through 20 years of war. The ones from small submerged islands continue to return [to them]. They want to sink with the islands they say, and die in dignity. Why relocate? We have not contributed to what is happening. I’ve been doing this since 1992 and was a schoolteacher until there were no children to teach in the conflict, but there were so many human rights violations of women – my friends and I formed our agency to be together, and I mobilised groups to talk of women’s rights. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, United Nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples On women and climate change, there is a direct line between disaster and violence. In countries like Honduras, this situation leads to prostitution and trafficking for most women who have been forced to relocate due to climate change, since the criminal syndicates are in charge. Disaster affects children too – I have seen bridges destroyed so it is impossible to walk to school. Indigenous women ask for respect for their reproductive health rights. During Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, there was no gender sensitivity about relief material like sanitary pads for women. Their world view is tied up in their land, and their knowledge is linked to that. Women are the seed-keepers, but their crops are destroyed. They transmit knowledge, and can provide solutions in times of floods or droughts. Indigenous people have some anti-women traditions, like inheritance laws or male governance systems. My own Igorot community pushed for the removal of bride prices and dowry practices. Tarja Halonen, former president of Finland Women are under-represented and underestimated. They should be recognised as part of all of the human capital we have – both men and women, the young and the poor, indigenous people and disabled people. At this historical level, the experience of men and women is different. Over the course of my career … what I did come to see was that [women in] all of the Nordic countries still had much better opportunities than many other women – so what could happen if we used all this knowledge and human capital? One of the key issues I campaign on is sexual and reproductive health; when I was a student radical in the 60s and 70s, I didn’t think it would take 40 years [to get this far]. Gender sensitivity is in effect and most people understand it. As for those in more masculine societies or governments who might feel threatened, my answer is always the same: the smartest men will survive. Leni Buisman, member of Dutch delegation to COP 21 For the Dutch government, gender is important; our trade and development minister, Lilianne Ploumen, and the minister of foreign affairs have been great advocates; our new environment minister is a woman. I got the role of tackling gender and climate change as I experienced a lot over my 40 years in politics. On an institutional level the women and gender constituency is very well organised, but delegations would take gender on as an “extra”. With Finland and Iceland, we invented a network for women delegations at COP. It was slow at first but there is more of a feeling for gender on every delegation now. We seek to enlighten, and we need a gender-focused climate policy. Two types of people look at gender – the emotional people who see it as a feeling – in Europe it’s in our genes – and those who see it as getting more efficient climate policy. Women need technology and can make decisions. We’re missing half the population otherwise – isn’t it so easy to see? You miss their power and energy. I am optimistic but when I see chances not taken … it’s all about being gender-responsive, and having an action-oriented plan. What comes next? It’s about women having access and being in control of their situation. Isabella Avila Borgeson, Filipino-American poet I’m from Oakland, California, and I went to the Philippines to find my mother when I heard about the Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, where the eye of the storm was in my family’s hometown. I didn’t know for almost a week if she was dead or alive. Family members died, our homes were destroyed. I meant to stay for three months to help the community, and I stayed for over a year. Some livelihood projects after the typhoon were for men, like construction jobs. Some women had lost their husbands and were left out of conversations like [those on] relief-rehabilitation projects, working mainly with women in no-build zones, close to the seashores. As spoken poets we’re representing marginalised communities. We won a competition inspired by Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, and three out of four of us are women. I could write about being Filipino and my homeland. Our boats got washed away, our rice fields got flooded in sea salt, coconut trees are decapitated so you need to uproot and plant them for another seven years. The women’s livelihoods through [weaving with bushes were] completely wiped out. We’ve had so many more typhoons since then which don’t get coverage, even super typhoons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/23/climate-change-coalition-accused-of-politicising-greenhouse-gas-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-23T03:00:41Z","webTitle":"Climate change: Coalition accused of politicising greenhouse gas target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/23/climate-change-coalition-accused-of-politicising-greenhouse-gas-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/23/climate-change-coalition-accused-of-politicising-greenhouse-gas-target","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: Coalition accused of politicising greenhouse gas target","bodyText":"The Abbott government has been accused of politicising the release of official greenhouse gas projections that confirm Australia’s international climate change pledge for 2020 is becoming easier to reach, but which will also increase pressure for Australia to adopt a more ambitious post-2020 target. The official figures have shown that the total greenhouse gas reduction required to meet Australia’s bipartisan minimum target of a 5% cut by 2020 is now 236m tonnes, a decrease on previous estimates. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the previous projections had been “Labor’s numbers” and that the lower projections were “because Labor’s numbers exaggerated the abatement task by more than a billion tonnes of emissions”. “Labor used these figures in an attempt to justify the world’s largest carbon tax that hurt families and businesses by pushing up electricity prices,” Hunt said. The former Liberal leader John Hewson said the official projections were, and always had been, produced by the environment department based on the best available evidence at the time. “Both parties have always based their policies on these projections. To try to politicise them in this way is enormously counterproductive and damaging to the national interest,” Hewson said. Professor Ross Garnaut, Labor’s former climate change adviser, said there was “nothing at all political in the change in trajectory … these figures have been produced in the same way since the Howard years”. The official figures attributed the decrease to “lower electricity demand … due to the uptake of household solar, energy efficiency and increased retail prices; worse-than-expected agricultural conditions due to drought; lower manufacturing output due to industrial closures and weaker growth expectations for local coal production due to a fall in international coal prices”. The latest forecasts are very close to private estimates, including those from Frontier Economics, published by Guardian Australia in September 2014, which calculated Australia’s task to 2020 would be about 225m tonnes. The revised figures mean the task of reducing emissions by 5% requires less than a third of the effort envisaged when both major parties signed up to the 2020 target. In 2012 the promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In 2014 new government calculations reduced that figure to 421m tonnes. The new figures were based on the assumption that the renewable energy target is reduced to a “real 20%” – something the government has yet to agree with Labor. If it is unable to achieve this reduction and the existing RET remains, additional renewable energy is likely to take greenhouse emissions even lower. The figures explain why the government remains confident it can meet the target even though it has repealed the carbon tax and has not yet begun auctions under its $2.55bn “Direct Action” scheme. The first auction will be held in April. Hunt said the new figures meant the Coalition would “easily meet our commitment to reduce Australia’s emissions by 5% from 2000 levels by 2020”. But modelling by Sinclair Knight Merz, released during the 2013 election campaign, which found the Coalition would need to find at least another $4bn to meet its target, was based on broadly similar projections. Energy market analyst RepuTex said it still believed the $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, on its own, would fail to meet the 2020 target – even taking the new projections into account. “We forecast that the ERF will purchase between 80m and 120m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions abatement. This is equivalent to around half of Australia’s new 2020 abatement task,” RepuTex said. RepuTex said that to meet the target the government would have to establish a “baseline and credit” emissions trading scheme, using so-called safeguards mechanisms that have been legislated but not yet explained in detail. The government is soon to release a discussion paper on how it will set its post-2020 emissions reduction target. It will announce this target mid-year, ahead of the United Nations conference in Paris in December. The Climate Institute thinktank said the new figures did not explain how the government would meet its 2020 emissions reduction targets, let alone deeper cuts after 2020. Its chief executive, John Connor, said: “It’s not much use to say that the job has got easier when you still don’t have the tools to do it properly.” “Without a plan to modernise and decarbonise our economy, Australia’s ballooning pollution through 2020 and beyond will require massive dollops of taxpayer funds if the primary policy tool remains the Emissions Reduction Fund.” “These new projections are consistent with independent modelling that shows the government’s policies still aren’t up to the task of cutting Australian emissions even by the minimum amount we’ve committed to, let alone match comparable countries’ efforts or drive the deeper decarbonisation we will need over coming decades. The government has provided no modelling to argue otherwise.” Garnaut said the government’s optimism was also based on a continuation of recent reductions in electricity emissions, which “were helped by a carbon price and have been hindered by recent policy developments”. The total task of reducing emissions by 236m tonnes takes into account a “carryover” because Australia exceeded its 2012 reduction target, which actually allowed a small increase in emissions and was easily achieved through calculating the impact of reduced land clearing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/18/mobile-payment-utilitlies-east-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-18T16:12:39Z","webTitle":"Using mobile money to buy water and solar power in east Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/18/mobile-payment-utilitlies-east-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/18/mobile-payment-utilitlies-east-africa","fields":{"headline":"Using mobile money to buy water and solar power in east Africa","bodyText":"For many of Thomas Duveau’s customers in rural, off-grid communities in Tanzania, buying a solar panel system for their home will be their first big commercial transaction, and probably the largest of their life. Mobisol’s solar panel systems can cost over $1,000 (£599), which is unaffordable for many sub-Saharan Africans, whose annual income is as little as $1,600. However with a business model that encourages incremental payments over 36 months, offers transparent payment through mobile banking, and encourages residents to use their panels for profit, this energy option is becoming increasingly appealing to farming communities across Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Solar energy provides a cheaper and safer alternative to diesel generators, kerosene lamps and old batteries, but a key barrier to access is cash. “A solar home system costs money that is not available in cash to the people we sell it to, so you need a microloan,” says Duveau, head of business development at Mobisol. The cheapest 10 watt solar system can power a small radio, one to three lamps and charge up to two mobile phones for $9 a month. But is that still too expensive? Deveau says there is demand for an even more espensive system. “With big systems you can charge 10 mobile phones, you can run a TV for a village cinema, you can run a fridge to sell cold beers, you can earn $75-100 a month from this – suddenly your customer can become an entrepreneur.” Along with the incremental payment and potential to make profit, it is the mobile payment aspect of the system that’s opening doors for users. “50% of our customers had never used mobile money before, so paying off the mobisol system was their entrypoint. Now they can take part in other commercial transactions or start a savings account.” Each customer has agreed for Mobisol to store their data, including a credit history, so the company knows exactly how much has been paid towards off. “Collecting payment by mobile makes the transaction more transparent. Our customers just pay the price of a text message to transfer money as we cover Vodacom’s M-Pesa fee.” The increasing adoption of mobile money across east Africa has made it easier for other start-ups such as Grundfos Lifelink (GLL) to begin to plug the gap in service provision to the poorest communities. Across rural Africa, some 50,000 water supply points have failed, representing a waste of US$215-360 million. GLL’s product helps its customers avoid the middleman at the water pump who often takes a cut for himself and triples prices in drought season, says Peter Todbjerg Hansen, managing director of this Danish provider of water management solutions. “The price has been fixed within the system and you pay cashlessly, so nobody can harass you to pay a higher price.” The company replaced water pumps with automatic dispensers, allowing families to access water usinfg a key fob to which they have transferred money via text message. GLL’s pilot project reached 75,000 people in Kenya alone (pdf). But Bill Maurer, director of the Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion at the University of California, is sceptical about how replicable and scalable businesses like GLL and Mobisol are. “For those who are in areas where mobile money hasn’t really taken off yet, people are reluctant to put all their faith in new mobile based services – they’re buying water from a local vendor, getting some from a well, and also sending a child to fetch some because they want a diversity of sources.” “From our research, we learned that if the fees on money transfers start to hurt even a little bit, they’ll turn off.” Mobile money solutions also pose ethical concerns for businesses – a previous partnership between Safaricom and Equity Bank in Kenya raised the question ‘who owns the customer’s data when you go into partnership with a mobile network?’ “The business is at the mercy of the mobile network. Networks are becoming such important carriers of all kinds of information, a wider debate is needed. At what point do we think of them as a utility? How do we ensure that businesses can earn a profit but there’s adequate consumer protection?” For now, Mobisol and GLL are looking to introduce their services to other countries in the region by 2015. Their success will depend not just on mobile phone penetration in those communities, but on how willing customers are to put their faith in a new way of making financial transactions.

Dr Jeremy Leggett, who has had consultations on climate change with senior oil company executives over 25 years, says it will not be a rerun of the BP story when the company launched its “beyond petroleum” strategy and then did a U-turn. “One of the oil companies will break ranks and this time it is going to stick,” he said. “The industry is facing plunging commodity prices and soaring costs at risky projects in the Arctic, deepwater Brazil and elsewhere. “Oil companies are also realising it is no long morally defensible to ignore the consequences of climate change.” Leggett, now a solar energy entrepreneur and climate campaigner, points to Total of France as the kind of group that could abandon carbon fuels in the same way that E.ON, the German utility, announced plans before Christmas to spin off coal and gas interests and concentrate its future growth on renewables. Pressure on the energy industry to pull out of fossil fuels has grown in recent months with a campaign for pension funds to disinvest from coal, oil and gas. A new report published this week by researchers at University College London deepened the message that vast amounts of oil in the Middle East, coal in the US and gas in Russia cannot be exploited if the global temperature rise is to be held at the 2C level safety limit agreed by countries. Leggett, who once conducted research into shale funded by BP and Shell, chairs Carbon Tracker Initiative, a thinktank which aims to raise awareness among key decision-makers about the risks that fossil fuel investments pose to wider financial stability. He believes the current 50% slump in the price of Brent crude will cause the US shale boom to go bust with potentially alarming consequences for the financial system. “Many of the shale drillers have been feasting on junk bond finance, which was so easy when oil prices were above $100 (£66) but with prices at $50 confidence is going to collapse,” he said. “Should the shale narrative evaporate then it is going to be very embarrassing for all sorts of political promoters of the industry, including George Osborne.” Leggett said that despite the price collapse due to oversupply, he remained convinced the “peak oil” theory that supplies will eventually be unable to meet demand remains intact. This is not because there are not the oil or gas reserves in the ground to meet future growth, but because they are too costly and environmentally dangerous to produce, he argues. “I would say to both the utility industry and the oil and gas industry: its game over, guys,” he said. “You have got to identify the point at which it’s all going to be thoroughly changed and you have got to map back from it. “You have to think strategically. The point to map back from is zero carbon in the energy system, not the electricity system, by 2050, because more than 100 governments want that in the [next UN climate change] treaty being prepared for signing in Paris.” But he also believes the energy industry is privately aware of the problems as it watches its own costs of fossil fuel extraction going up while the costs of solar and other new technologies are coming down. Leggett, who plans to stands down as chairman of the highly successful Solarcentury renewable business he founded to focus on climate change campaigning, holds what he calls “friendly critic” sessions with the fossil fuel sector these days. The tone of the meetings has changed significantly over the past two years, he said. “Before it was know your enemy. Now it’s: ‘Crikey. A lot of this may be coming true on our watch. What shall we do about it?’ There are top-to-bottom strategic reviews going on in E.ON but in other companies as well, utility and oil and gas. So it will be really interesting to see which is the first of the oil and gas companies to break from the pack, although I fear BP and Shell are going backwards not forwards on carbon.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/feb/10/australia-weather-heat-power-outage-blackout-fire-danger-nsw-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T07:17:56Z","webTitle":"Australia weather: heat records broken in Sydney during heatwave – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/feb/10/australia-weather-heat-power-outage-blackout-fire-danger-nsw-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/feb/10/australia-weather-heat-power-outage-blackout-fire-danger-nsw-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia weather: heat records broken in Sydney during heatwave – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s the wrap of the day.

The small number of outages reported by Ausgrid this afternoon were attributed to a local network fault The Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle shut off its three potlines for a period late on Friday afternoon to reduce its electricity usage, as requested by the energy provider AGL and AEMO In Canberra, the Senate inquiry into the resilience of electricity infrastructure in a warming world debated the Australian energy network’s reliance on coal, while the federal and SA governments sparred over what was to blame for the loss of power to 90,000 homes in the state on Wednesday An out-of-control grass fire in Georges Plain, Bathurst, was contained by firefighters A statewide fire ban is in place over the weekend for NSW, many national parks have been closed and the Randwick races have been postponed due to the extreme weather conditions forecast Elswhere in Australia, Perth recorded its second-wettest day in history … and snow is forecast for some parts of Tasmania over the weekend Thanks for following along with our coverage, and if you’re weathering the heatwave in Australia, take care this weekend. Gold Coast beaches are expected to reopen on Saturday as a heatwave sweeps southern Queensland. Dangerous swells forced the closure of more than a dozen beaches on Friday, delivering a blow to those wanting respite from the heat. Beaches at Surfers Paradise, Staghorn Avenue, Elkhorn Avenue, South Narrowneck, Narrowneck, Breaker Street, Broadbeach and Miami remained closed late on Friday afternoon. However Gold Coast City Council anticipates beaches from Burleigh to Rainbow will reopen on Saturday morning. “Lifeguards and lifesavers will check the beaches north of this area in the morning prior to making a decision,” a council spokeswoman said. However, anticipated tidal surges in the morning may delay the flags going up in some areas. The mercury is expected to reach 34C on the Gold Coast on Saturday as heatwave conditions begin to grip southern Queensland. Here’s a full report from AAP on the power cut to the Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle. Energy provider AGL has cut power to an NSW aluminium smelter as the state tries to manage record demand for electricity. The Australian Workers Union has warned the move could “batter” the smelter but AGL says the cut was required to ensure power was kept on in “schools, homes and other small businesses”. The Tomago smelter uses 950 megawatts a day – about 12% of the state’s electricity – and is AGL’s largest single customer. The smelter’s three pot line are being shut down sequentially for 75 minutes each from 3.45pm on Friday, Tomago Aluminium chief executive Matt Howell told AAP. “Our concern is that this was done in the hottest part of the day when the market operator AEMO ... said they only needed us to curtail load for a maximum of three hours. That’s one hour per pot line.” Workers have donned special suits and are labouring in 80C heat in the smelter on Friday evening to save the plant’s equipment. AGL defended the move saying it had “certain contractual rights” to interrupt electricity supply at the smelter. “If power to the smelter is not curtailed, schools, homes and other small businesses will suffer a loss of power at the peak periods of demand this (Friday) afternoon,” an AGL spokesman told AAP. “This procedure has been implemented previously without adverse effect in similar circumstances to those that exist today.” But Howell says it’s incorrect to say there’s been “no harm done” in the past. The union argues workers will need to pull out all stops to save the plant’s equipment and “they may not be successful”. An outage at the Portland smelter in Victoria in 2016 destroyed millions of dollars worth of equipment, AWU national secretary Daniel Walton said in a statement. Australian summer. My colleagues, Michael Slezak and Dave Fanner, have put together this video explainer outlining why there’s been the risk of power shortages today. The temperature in Sydney approaching 6pm AEST is a still-sweltering 32.8C. It can expect a forecast high of 39C tomorrow. Adelaide is at 39.8C, with a forecast high of 34C for Saturday. Canberra is still at 40.2C with a “hot and mostly sunny” forecast of 41C ahead. Brisbane is 29.1C now and can look forward to a high of 36C tomorrow. Looks like there’s no need for load shedding. Saturday’s Randwick races have been postponed due to the extreme weather forecast for Sydney. Racing NSW and the Australian Turf Club made the call out of concern for the welfare of horses and punters. Racing NSW chief executive, Peter V’landys AM, said he had been in communication with the Bureau of Meteorology as to the likely conditions. “Racing NSW and the ATC believed that animal welfare and the welfare of the participants should be the only consideration when making this decision.” The meeting has been postponed to 13 February, with further details to come. Ten News is reporting that 11,000 homes in Strathfield and Burwood are without power. Ausgrid says it was due to fault on the local network, not load shedding as a result of excessive demand over heat, and that most customers have had services restored. About 900 customers at The Entrance North, NSW, are without power in an unrelated outage. Ausgrid crews are investigating what caused electricity to be lost, and it should be restored by 6:30pm. This shows the rising demand in parts of NSW over the course of the day as recorded by Ausgrid. Questions have been raised over why two units at a major NSW power plant are not operational as the state faces a potential power crisis. AGL Energy confirmed to AAP that two of the four units at its Liddell power station had been shut down due to leaks in boiler tubes, which can force outages without warning. AGL expected one of the units to be up and running by late Saturday night but the second would not be functioning until late next week. Liddell power station was purchased by AGL Energy from the NSW government in 2014. The AGL Macquarie network produces approximately 12% of the power for eastern Australia. Labor leader Luke Foley demanded an explanation from the Berejiklian government earlier today. “We’ve got the energy minister out there now on radio telling people to turn off their air conditioners, to turn up the temperature in their refrigerators, just to keep the lights on,” Foley told reporters. “What he hasn’t told us is that only two of the four units at the Liddell power station are operational.” Energy minister Don Harwin said it was common for coal-fired power stations to have transient faults. “This is the nature of a coal fired power stations,” he told reporters in Sydney. “Lidell is playing its part and its owner is playing its part in ensuring that we get through today in good shape.” Penrith earlier recorded a temperature of 44.5C. Enjoy a high of 21C in Tasmania on Saturday. Meanwhile, in Perth: A major flood warning has been issued for Northam, east of the city, with people told to prepare to evacuate. Rapid and powerful flooding is expected in the Avon River. Minor flooding is also predicted for the Perth metropolitan area, due to rising waters in the Murray and Swan River catchments as unusually heavy summer rain hits WA’s south. The heat is affecting the air quality in Sydney with ozone leading to poor readings in east and north-west Sydney as well as the lower Hunter, central coast and Illawarra regions. “Poor” denotes a score of between 100 and 149 on the air quality index. Parts of Sydney had recorded similar readings in early January. Ozone is an irritant secondary pollutant formed by chemical reactions between atmospheric gases and nitrogen oxides from car-vehicle exhausts on sunny days. The problem is exacerbated by lack of wind. Environment NSW has closed many national parks and reserves in Sydney, across the Hunter, central coast and Great Lakes regions, and the upper central west and north-west regions as a result of the elevated fire danger over the weekend. The acting director of the metro branch of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Deon Van Rensburg, said the closures were about safeguarding the public when the risk of fire was high. “We apologise for any inconvenience but are sure most will agree it is the right thing to do in the face of such extreme heat and heightened bushfire risk.” Some visitor areas would remain open. For updates and the latest information visit Environment NSW’s website, but at this stage the closures will affect these parks across the Hunter, central coast and Great Lakes region: Watagans national park Blue Gum Hill national park Karuah national park Wallaroo national park Karuah state conservation area Medowie state conservation area Karuah nature reserve Medowie nature reserve Wallingat national park Jilliby state conservation area Popran national park Also affected were all parks across the upper central west and north-west areas, including: Warrumbungle national park Pilliga national park, Pilliga state conservation area and Pilliga nature reserve Mount Kaputar national park Beni state conservation area Goonoo state conservation area Trunkey Rd has reopened following the grass fire on Wimbledon Rd in Bathurst. Observations released by the Bureau of Meteorology just after 4pm have put Sydney airport at 39C, and 37.2C for Observatory Hill in Sydney. Olympic Park, Badgerys Creek, Bankstown, Camden, Campbelltown, Canterbury, Holsworthy, Horsley Park, Lucas Heights, Mangrove Mountain, Richmond and Williamtown were all recording temperatures of above 40C. Penrith recorded 44.5C. In the Hunter region, Cessnock airport had recorded 43.3C and Maitland airport 42.8C. Mudgee, in the central tablelands, had just cracked 40C, as had Canberra in the southern tablelands and Gunnedah airport in the north-west slopes and plains. A statewide fire ban is in place over the weekend. Liberal Senator, Chris Back, has just pointed out in the Senate committee that Perth has experienced its coldest February maximum temperature and its wettest February day. Back, a West Australian, also objected earlier today to references to the “national electricity market” and “national electricity grid” because it implied there was a giant cable across the Nullarbor Plain when WA is in fact not connected to the “east coast electricity market”. So it seems the point of this intervention is to demonstrate he is a proud West Australian rather than suggesting we all hop on a flight to Perth to cool down. Further to the warning that Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle might have power cut to it this afternoon, the ABC Newcastle’s Giselle Wakatama has said it has been forced to shut down three potlines by energy provider AGL. Tomago’s chief executive, Matt Howell, told ABC Newcastle that forcing the smelter to shut down power could cause catastrophic damage to equipment and was a disgrace. The Australian Workers Union has also resisted the decision. The NSW energy minister, Don Harwin, has thanked Tomago for doing its bit to reduce demand on electricity. According to the Newcastle Herald, the smelter consumed 12% of the state’s energy and was asked to reduce its energy consumption this afternoon. AGL said in a statement that it would cut power to the plant if necessary, as agreed with AEMO. This graphic shows temperature change from satellite from 0630 to 1330 AEDT. Mildura has hit 45C, and Swan Hill 42C in Wangaratta. Sydney airport has recorded its hottest February day in more than 70 years: 43C. We’re nearing crunch time for electricity supply, with the Australian Energy Market Operator warning of potential shortfalls from 3.30pm AEDT. AEMO expects electricity demand in NSW to reach about 14,700 megawatts, the highest-ever level in the state. The real-time graphic showing electricity price and demand on its website is apparently not loading. The Australian Workers Union has warned that the Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle could be “battered” if energy provider AGL cuts power for four hours this afternoon, as it threatened to do. Workers would have to labour in 37C heat to save the plant’s equipment from destruction if that occurred, the AWU’s national secretary, Daniel Walton, said. “Our information is that power could be cut this afternoon ... If that happens the results could be catastrophic,” he said. “Workers will have to pull out all stops in sweltering heat to save the plant’s equipment. They may not be successful.” An outage at the Portland smelter in Victoria in 2016 destroyed millions of dollars worth of equipment, the union secretary said. AAP sought comment from AGL. The Senate committee now has its star witness: the Australian Energy Market Operator’s executive general manager, David Swift. This is the body that intervened to “shed load”, ie order blackouts in South Australia when demand outstripped supply. “We certainly weren’t asleep at the wheel,” Swift said of Wednesday’s blackout. He explained AEMO’s forecast for energy demand was below what eventuated due to “the extremity of the day”. “It was the highest day of demand ever in South Australia by quite a significant margin,” he said. He said on Tuesday peak demand was 1,800MW. On the Wednesday it was over 3,000, which he called an “unprecedented rise and an unprecedented level of demand”. By the time the gap in supply was clear, it was too late to order the second gas generator at Pelican Point. The committee chair, Sarah Hanson-Young, wasn’t impressed: “My 10 year-old daughter knew it was going to be stinking hot on Wednesday.” Canberra: 39.3C (forecast high: 41C) Adelaide: 36.3C (39C) Sydney: 36.2C (38C) Brisbane: 32.3C (32C) Darwin: 27.7C (30C) And from Guardian Australia’s Mike Bowers’ dashboard in Liverpool, Sydney, 40 minutes ago ... Queensland will be “chiming in” with 1,000 megawatts of excess power generation to help other states, the state’s energy minister, Mark Bailey, has said. That amount, which is what the Australian Energy Market Operator has asked for, is the maximum that can be sent via the power interconnector to New South Wales, Bailey said. Bailey, a staunch renewable energy advocate bent on trying to lift that sector’s share of state generation to 50% by 2030, noted: “We’re expecting Queensland power to be chiming in through the interconnector to our bigger NSW neighbours to meet their power needs today.” On most days the Queensland network produces 8,000 MW, with an excess reserve capacity of 2,000 MW. “This is a classic case of the interconnector [being] a valuable piece of technology, because quite frankly, without Queensland power today, NSW would be in absolute dire straits,” Bailey said. He criticised the federal government for its attacks on renewable energy. “The NSW crisis today, where they’ve got a lack of reserve… this is in a state with one of the lowest levels of large-scale renewables in the country,” Bailey said. “That’s something [the federal government] can’t explain because it doesn’t fit in with their ideological position.” The ABC has a handy state-by-state guide to when the most unpleasant bit of the heatwave will end. In summary: on Sunday in SA, on Sunday and Monday in NSW, and Tuesday in Queensland (although later in the north). In the ACT it’ll cool to “only” 32C on Sunday and be more bearable on Monday. A 2014 study by researchers from Macquarie University on the number of heat-associated deaths found there were significantly more heat-associated deaths in the early 1900s, but that there has also been a recent increase in the 2000s: Here’s the same chart, but showing total deaths rather than a rate of population: Fire crews “are gaining the upper hand” on that blaze in Georges Plains, Bathurst. With much of mainland Australia bracing for heatwave conditions, residents in some parts of Tasmania have quite a different weekend ahead. The forecast for Mt Wellington in Hobart warns of snow above 900m on Sunday and above 1,000m on Monday. The forecast high for each day is 6C and 7C. Snow was also forecast above 1,000m in Lake St Clair in the state’s central plateau, and above 900m in Liawenee. Hobart, at least, has a reasonably warm – if wet – weekend ahead, with a forecast high of 22C for Saturday and 17C for Sunday with showers developing. As NSW, the ACT and South Australia brace for possible heatwave-related power cuts, nearly 10,000 properties in Perth have been left without electricity for another reason. Heavy rain in WA’s south-west has caused flash flooding, cutting power to 9,000 properties. Perth has come close to having its wettest day, with more than 114mm of rain in the 24 hours to Friday morning – slightly shy of the record 120.6mm that fell on 9 February 1992. The unseasonal weather also resulted in the city reaching only 17.4C on Thursday, making it Perth’s coldest February day. A Western Power spokesman there 2,900 homes were still without electricity on Friday morning. The Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster, Catherine Schelfhout, said there would be risks of flooding in the upper Swan River in coming days. “This weather is pretty unusual.” The Greens have given their two cents on the South Australian blackout at a press conference in Canberra. The leader, Richard Di Natale, said there was spare capacity that wasn’t used, referring to the second Port Pelican gas generator. He said the blackout was therefore like turning on your fan/refrigerator when it wasn’t plugged in. Di Natale called Malcolm Turnbull a “climate Judas” because the government is considering supporting “clean coal” technology, which he said amounted to selling out the planet to keep the Liberal leadership. Sarah Hanson-Young, who is chairing the Senate committee into electricity infrastructure, said the solutions to blackouts were investment in storage solutions, and new rules for the market operator so they could be ordered to bring supply online to keep the lights on. She questioned why the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, hadn’t done that, and said the treasurer, Scott Morrison, bringing a lump of coal to question time on Thursday was “a stunt”. Three students have been hospitalised north of Brisbane after suffering from heat-related problems. Paramedics treated 16 teenagers at The Lakes College about 10am AEST, and two girls and one boy were taken to hospital as a precaution. In South Australia, 39 have been admitted to hospital with heat-related illnesses in the past two days, according to SA Health. People in heatwave conditions have been advised to avoid strenuous physical activity in the heat of the day and to drink plenty of water. Signs of heat-related illness may include nausea, vomiting, faintness and dizziness, loss of appetite, weakness and headaches. Canberra residents are being reminded to reduce their electricity use as the temperature rises to 40C in the national capital. They’ve been told to limit air conditioning by not going below 26 degrees and turning off all unnecessary lighting, the emergency services agency says. Using dishwashers, dryers and vacuum cleaners should also be avoided to limit non-essential electricity use especially during the afternoon peak period. “The ACT has been advised due to the potential for record high electricity demand across NSW because of the extreme heat conditions there may be minor supply shortfalls across the network,” the ESA warned on Friday. The temperature in Canberra hit 37.7C at 1pm, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. A total fire ban is in place for the ACT on Friday and Saturday. Last chance to charge your phones ... The chart below, from the Australian Energy Market Operator, is for New South Wales but the situation is similar for Queensland. Greenpeace is calling on the Turnbull government to give up its addiction to coal, which it says is making heatwaves more extreme and leaving many Australians without electricity. Climate and clean energy campaigner Nikola Casule said: “The best way to guard against blackouts is to invest across the grid in renewable energy and storage, which provides affordable, reliable power without adding more fuel to the fire of global warming. “The treasurer’s antics waving around coal in the parliament yesterday won’t do anything to help Australians suffering through unbearable heat and worrying about blackouts today.” Casule is referring there to Scott Morrison bringing a sizeable chunk of coal into question time on Thursday for show and tell with Labor: “This is coal, don’t be afraid.” Barnaby Joyce juggled with it. Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy wrote of the episode: What a bunch of clowns, hamming it up when real people are suffering blackouts in South Australia, when the country is sweltering through a summer that feels ominous and oppressive – that heat that just won’t let up, almost as if those pesky climate scientists might be on to something. Trunkey Rd in Georges Plains, Bathurst, is closed in both directions between Wimbledon Rd and Rockley Rd due to that grass fire. The advice from NSW RFS is to avoid the area. The status of the fire remains at “watch and act”. Nem-Watch and RenewEconomy have produced a live widget that displays how much electricity in each state is being generated, and from what source. When blackouts occurred in SA, it appeared politically expedient for some to blame the high proportion of renewables used in that state. But looking at the widget below, it’s clear that explanation wouldn’t work for NSW, where the majority of electricity is from coal. The body that runs the national electricity market is still warning of possible blackouts in NSW this afternoon. The highest risk is now between 3.30pm and 5.30pm. The Australian Energy Market Operator calls this “load shedding”. In order to protect the infrastructure, the load on the system is reduced by ordering blackouts. The aim of load shedding is to minimise impact on any one group of energy users, by rolling the blackouts around different areas. But if the demand and supply changes rapidly, that is not always possible. The market operator – Aemo – has been begging energy generators to bid into the electricity market, but they appear to not have had enough of a response. They have now turned to asking consumers – you – to use less electricity. In a media release today, they said: “If consumers can safely reduce their electricity consumption during periods of high demand, this can ease the supply/demand balance and can mitigate the need for load shedding.” Canberra 37.7C Adelaide 37.3C Sydney 35.5C Brisbane 32.8C The fire in Georges Plains is an out of control glass fire on Wimbledon Road. NSW RFS has put its status at “watch and act”, reflecting a “heightened level of threat” – one step above “advice”, indicating that a fire has started but there is no immediate danger, and below an “emergency warning”, the highest level of alert possible. Here’s chopper footage of that fire on Wimbledon Rd, Georges Plains. “Isolated properties are in the area.” A few minutes ago the Rural Fire Service reported a “fast-moving grass fire” in the Georges Plains region of Bathurst. I’ll see what more I can find about this. The NSW RFS warned of dangerous fire conditions across much of NSW yesterday, with commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons pointing to the potentially deadly combination of extremely high temperatures and wind. Severe and extreme fire dangers were expected in widespread areas, and there was the potential for catastrophic fire danger in the Hunter region on Sunday. If you see an unattended fire, you’re reminded to call 000. In Port Stephens, in the Hunter region of NSW, beach patrol hours have been extended for the weekend. Near Hay, in the western Riverina region, Fairfax’s Daisy Huntly has taken a temperature of 52.6C in a shearing shed – and nearing 47C outside. According to Bom, that’s the max forecast for the day. Labor MP Tony Burke: It’s not on the market yet, but scientists have invented a material that’s cheap to produce, lightweight, and can cool a surface against the heat of the sun without using energy. AFP reported on Thursday that a study published in the journal Science found a glass-polymer hybrid material, only slightly thicker than aluminium foil, could be “transformative” in radiative cooling technology. Uses for the product could include keeping buildings and other objects cool, as well as extending the life of solar panels. In field tests the material showed a cooling power roughly equivalent to the electricity generated using solar cells for a similar area, and could cool continuously both day and night. “Just 10 to 20 square metres of this material on the rooftop could nicely cool down a single-family house in summer,” said co-author Gang Tan, an associate professor in the University of Wyoming’s department of civil and architectural engineering. Researchers say the material is lightweight, easy to fit to curved surfaces, and fairly simple to mass produce. As heat rises, more electricity is needed to be used by appliances around the state, especially by air-conditioners that need to work harder to keep offices and homes cool. On Thursday the Australian Energy Market Operator sent out several increasingly dire warnings about the likely shortfall of electricity supply. The first said there would be a 19MW deficit in NSW about 3pm. As it does in these situations, it asked the market to respond. In other words, it asked generators to get ready to fire up their turbines and bid into the electricity market. But that request seemed to go unheeded. Throughout the afternoon on Thursday the forecast deficit when from 19MW to over 250MW, to as much as 419MW at the last update a little after 5pm yesterday. To put that in context, that’s about as much energy as the total a large gas power plant can produce, and about a third of the maximum capacity of a coal power plant. It’s a lot of energy. The crazy thing is that the demand for electricity is forecast to be significantly less than the full capacity of the electricity generators in the state. Even if you exclude all the wind and solar, the state has about 15,500MW. And that’s not even including the electricity that can be imported from Queensland. So why there’s a shortage is not totally clear. And why electricity generators aren’t offering to bid into the market, even though wholesale electricity prices are going to be very high, is rather confounding. Whatever the case is, with NSW having relatively little renewable energy capacity, the desperate rush from the coal lobby and the Coalition to blame renewables will be a little hard to maintain. It’s a little after noon AEDT and here’s how the heatwave-affected cities are shaping up. Canberra 36.3C (forecast high: 41C) Adelaide 34.8C (39) Sydney 31.9C (38) Brisbane 29.6C (32) Meanwhile, a climate and health expert at the Australian National University’s climate change institute has warned that extreme high temperatures across NSW and the ACT could set temperature records. Dr Liz Hanna, president of the Climate and Health Alliance, says the extreme heat in these regions could set records for the number of consecutive days above 35C. It is rare for Sydney to record three days in a row of 35C. There have been only four occasions in history, the most recent in early January 1994. Four consecutive days in January 1960 topped 39C; two of them were above 41C. Penrith and Richmond, in Sydney’s western suburbs, have not had three consecutive days above 42C in 22 years and 64 years respectively – but that could change this weekend. As of 5 February, the northern NSW town of Moree had endured more than a month of days at or above 35C, more than double the number of consecutive days the previous record set in 1981. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast two days of 41C in Canberra, close to the record for the city’s hottest day, set at 42.2C in 1968. Even Australia’s native fauna, evolved over centuries to cope with its extreme weather conditions, struggle in summer. Wires, the animal welfare agency, has published tips on how you can help. They’re also the people to contact if you come across an animal in distress. In a statement published this morning, the Australian Energy Market Operator has warned of “tight” electricity supply conditions for NSW and the ACT. It says it’s as simple as people using more electricity – on air-conditioning and fans – because of the hot weather. It says shortfalls could be possible during the afternoon peak from about 1530 AEDT to 1730, “which may trigger the need for localised load shedding to rebalance the power system” to protect the network from damage, meaning households would be deliberately disconnected. It says it will aim for “rotational load shedding” to reduce the burden on its network but minimise the impact on any one group of customers. The question – particularly in SA where 90,000 households were without power – is whether something can be done, or we’ve just got to put up with shortfalls in future. Remember, all the signs point to even hotter summers to come. (I’m not happy about it either.) While we’re on the subject of energy, construction on the Silverton windfarm in western NSW is finally set to begin, after the sale of the project from AGL to its Powering Australian Renewables Fund. The deal will see AGL pay just $65 a megawatt hour for the first five years of the windfarm’s operation, effectively undercutting current prices for coal-generated electricity. “It’s a very low price, which demonstrates the amazing innovation and cost curve that renewable energy is on,” says Alicia Webb, director of large-scale energy at the Clean Energy Council, the clean energy industry’s peak body. Evidence of the carnage my colleague Naaman Zhou reported on this morning. With #heatwave trending all morning, Twitter is expressing its distress the only way it knows how: in gifs. Some energy providers are giving customers advance notice of planned power outages – this one for eight hours on 1 March, nearly three weeks away. The Senate committee in Canberra is inquiring into the resilience of electricity infrastructure, in part because everyone is sticking their air con on owing to global warming. While One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts has spent most of the morning trying to get witnesses to say that you can’t power an aluminium smelter off solar energy, the Greens’ Sarah Hanson Young wants witnesses to bite back on the federal government’s tendency to blame power outages on renewables. In relation to South Australia’s outages in recent days because of the heatwave John Bradley, the chief executive of Energy Networks Australia, said the “rush to blame after an operational event that occurred a few days ago is part of the problem”. “There are clearly issues with extreme weather events since last year contributing to outages. But the lessons of individual operational events need to be worked through in a clear way rather than engage in a rush to judgment.” He didn’t pin the all blame on the federal government, because all governments, state and federal, are responsible for aspects of energy policy. The RSPCA has renewed its warning not to leave dogs in hot cars, with multiple such fatalities already this summer. Police are investigating the deaths of four dogs this week in Gulgong, NSW, after being left in the back of a ute. “It’s apparent some people are just not getting the message that a parked car is no place for a dog. It can be lethal, as we see all too often,” said the RSPCA’s NSW chief inspector, David O’Shannessy. The RSPCA’s “Just Six Minutes” campaign refers to the length of time it takes a dog to die in a hot vehicle. Owners of dogs that die from being left in a car can be fined $22,000 or sentenced to two years’ prison. Anne Fawcett, a veterinarian at Sydney Animal Hospitals Inner West, has shared her tips for caring for animals in extreme heat. This French bulldog, pictured in Sydney’s Central Park just before 10am, has figured it out for himself. Though not all classrooms in Australia are air-conditioned, it seems there is no heatwave-related equivalent of a “snow day” granting pupils a day off. (In New Zealand, there are sometimes “earthquake days”.) The ABC has education departments’ policies by state and it seems only in extreme circumstances will the heat force school closures. In Victoria, “extreme weather conditions” may just mean a shorter lunch break (though dismissal time is “adjusted accordingly”). We’re not far off the forecast highs for the day, with Canberra at 35.3C, Sydney at 33.7C, Adelaide at 32.9C and Brisbane at 30.1C. (Melbourne is at a very comfortable 20.7C, and Perth, where there are flooding warnings, is just below 15.9C.) The Bureau of Meteorology has warned of severe to extreme heatwave conditions for southern Queensland and northern NSW for “several days”, with widespread temperatures in the low to mid-40s. Queensland also has high humidity to contend with. At the weekend, the severe heatwave will contract to eastern NSW with localised extreme patches through the northern coastal areas. SA and Victoria will experience easing conditions. Heading into Monday, “extreme” conditions will give way to those that are just “severe”, with a low-intensity heatwave moving across central and southern parts of Queensland. By Tuesday, even NSW residents can look forward to some relief. These graphics show three-day forecasts for the situation. In South Australia, flying foxes are reportedly dropping dead as a result of the extreme heat. The ABC reports that bats do not cope well in hot weather and that a Natural Resources SA ecologist expects the number of fatalities to rise. Below is an image of a dead bat being bagged. SA residents are advised not to touch the animals themselves as they may be diseased. If you’d like to see how One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts is engaging with the Senate inquiry into the resilience of electricity infrastructure in a warming world, the Adelaide Advertiser has his exchange with a scientist over “empirical evidence” that human activity has affected global temperatures. A majority of Kmart, Target, Big W, Bunnings Warehouse and the Good Guys stores were claiming to have completely sold out of portable fans owing to extreme demand, with Target staff in Sydney telling the Guardian that “as soon as a pallet hits the floor, it’s gone within a couple of hours”. “Every second customer wants a fan. I feel bad for them, because as soon as we get any, they’re gone.” A Big W store in Sydney’s west said it had sold out a month ago, and had no new stock on the way. A store manager added that all retailers in the local area were sold out. Maddie McCarthy, a student from Wollongong, has spent the past two days on the hunt, after her box fan “wasn’t cutting the mustard”. She was told by a number of major retailers that fans were effectively sold out in the Illawarra region. “I never heard anything about when they’d be back in stock.” Calls to stores in Woollongong confirmed they were sold out, with store managers unable to remember the last time they were in stock. In Sydney Target staff said they occasionally received new shipments overnight but could not be sure. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a Kmart in Bondi Junction was only expecting more stock “next summer”. A spokesperson for The Good Guys said its stores were seeing “incredible demand in NSW as a result of the current heatwave”. “As fast as we can get stock in, they are flying out the door. We have been bringing more stock into our stores to try and keep customers satisfied but we expect that this weekend’s heatwave will see an almost unprecedented level of demand.” Residents in search of relief have taken to venting online, with one Reddit user complaining: “Kmarts Ashfield, Burwood, Broadway have all run out of pedestal fans and are not getting any more in because they are now stocking up on winter items (would you believe?)” Tens of thousands of South Australian homes were deliberately blacked out on Wednesday evening as a result of a heatwave. SA Power Networks initially put the number of affected households at 44,000, but later confirmed to the Adelaide Advertiser that it was as high as 90,000. The front page of today’s Tiser suggests that SA residents might be a bit fed up. The Australian Energy Market Operator ordered a second generator for Port Adelaide’s Pelican Point to provide support on Thursday afternoon, and called for backup for NW on Friday and Saturday. The SA premier, Jay Weatherill, is blaming the national electricity market for the failure, stating that the Aemo could not be trusted to deliver reliably. But the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has criticised the state government for opening itself up to risk with its renewable energy policy. The Advertiser has reported on the blame game here. A Senate inquiry under way in Canberra today will hear about how the national grid can cope with spiking demand and renewable generation – Guardian Australia’s press gallery team will be reporting back on that later on. Meanwhile, on the other side of the continent, very different records are being broken in Western Australia. It’s the second-wettest day for Perth in recorded history, and could break the record for the coldest February morning. NSW is bracing for catastrophic weather, with emergency services on standby and authorities pleading with the community to be vigilant. The heatwave across the state, centred around the Hunter, will gradually worsen from Friday through to Sunday. “The catastrophic conditions is something that has not occurred in NSW since 2013,” the police and emergency services minister, Troy Grant, said in a press conference this morning. There is severe fire danger forecast for the ACT, and Grant said emergency services would be on high alert across the weekend. He encouraged people to postpone plans to visit national parks or areas where there was a fire risk, and suggested that “local infrastructure” such as “shopping centres [and] movie theatres” would offer respite from the heat”. The press conference can be viewed in its entirety on NSW police’s Facebook page. Good morning, It’s a day of extreme heat in many parts of Australia, with temperatures forecast to hit the mid-40s in parts of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. In NSW, police and health authorities, bracing for three days of 40-plus temperatures, have triggered their “heatwave action plan”. On top of expeceted hospital admissions, there is a high chance of bushfires and potential power cuts. A heatwave cut electricity to 44,000 households in South Australia on Wednesday, prompting questions about Australia’s energy security as we continue what is likely to be our hottest summer ever. I will be blogging today from the air-conditioned comfort of Guardian Australia’s office in Sydney, where the mercury had already hit 30.6C just after 10am.

To get certified by what is widely viewed as the world’s most demanding green building certification program, the $32.5m six-story Bullitt Center had to pass a year-long examination of its environmental merits to prove it performs as advertised. Now comes the hard part: convincing skeptics of the financial benefits of constructing more ‘deep green’ buildings like it. The nonprofit Bullitt Foundation, which built and owns the office building and is headquartered on the top floor, hopes to convince hesitant developers, institutions and governments to invest in similar structures. This may take considerably longer than it took to get certified. Assigning long term value to deep green buildings is a tricky undertaking, especially because their existence is so new. Financing has fallen through for multiple projects due in part to a dearth of historical information about comparable properties. The phenomenon of large commercial structures attaining elite Leed Platinum certification or beyond is so recent that researchers haven’t had enough time to assess their shorter term rental and resale performance, says Nils Kok, an expert on green building economics at Maastricht University in the Netherland. For less strenuous green building projects, however, evidence is mounting that investing in more sustainable structures pays off. In a 2010 study, Kok and colleagues found that buildings that attained Leed Gold status commanded an average premium of 20%. “We do find that greener actually leads to higher premiums on both the rent side as well as the transaction side,” Kok says. As a pilot project to determine the technical feasibility of constructing and operating a nearly self-sufficient office building, the Bullitt’s upfront costs ran an estimated 27% higher than those for a comparable structure built to code. “It’s hard to make a project like the Bullitt look good over a period of just five years,” says Denis Hayes, the foundation’s president and CEO. For universities, museums, municipalities and organizations looking to build more permanent flagship structures, however, Hayes hopes to make the case that a similar investment will provide ample benefits for decades. In 2014, for example, the Bullitt’s rooftop photovoltaic panels produced roughly 244,000 kilowatt hours of energy while the building used only 153,000 – enough surplus solar energy to power eight homes. If it’s technically possible for a commercial mid-rise in one of the nation’s cloudiest cities to become a net energy producer, Hayes points out, it’s possible nearly anywhere. The building’s design also slashed its energy demands to less than 40% of a comparable LEED Platinum building and less than 60% of a typical net zero energy building. Based on its better than anticipated energy-saving numbers, a new financial report suggests that the Bullitt could have included fewer solar panels and a smaller steel superstructure and still met its sustainability goals. Other economic calculations have proven more controversial. In 2014, a separate case study commissioned by the Bullitt Foundation and performed by Ecotrust, a Portland-based conservation organization, calculated that six of the Bullitt’s features – from energy efficiency to rainwater capture – could produce as much as $18.45m in public benefits. Some of the numbers rely on hotly debated values, such as a maximum price of $200 per metric ton of carbon emissions averted, and the overall benefits will accrue over 250 years. But Hayes says linking a building’s carbon footprint to economic consequences could help change the initial calculus for bankers and developers. Kok says he appreciates the attempt to quantify the benefits, but he maintains that some of the hypothetical values – particularly the price of carbon – are unlikely to sway the financial sector. “Can you bank on that? Can you underwrite it? I think it’s very challenging,” he says. Once built, however, Kok says deep green buildings are becoming prized in much the same way that Tesla’s expensive Model S electric car is highly coveted by auto buyers. “These are the new trophy buildings,” he says. In a separate study, he and colleagues found that law and financial firms, governments and oil and gas companies are among the tenants most likely to lease office space in what’s considered prime real estate. “They want to be in those buildings so badly that they pay a premium rent,” he says. A large law firm renting space in Washington, DC’s Leed Platinum-certified PNC Place, which opened in 2010, even used its new location as a recruiting tool. The presence of high quality tenants, in turn, can reduce the perception of risk and drive up resale values. In October 2014, PNC Place set a new record for the city when the trophy building sold for $392m, or $1,075 per square foot. At the very least, conversations about the value of deep green structures are moving into the mainstream, says Ralph DiNola, executive director of the New Buildings Institute in Vancouver, Washington. By his nonprofit organization’s count, the number of verified zero net energy commercial buildings nearly doubled between 2012 and 2015, while the number of buildings deemed capable of eventually reaching that goal nearly quadrupled. DiNola says accumulating evidence also suggests that well-executed deep green designs can minimize or eliminate additional upfront costs, potentially neutralizing financial concerns. Gary Saulson, director of corporate real estate for Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank, says the new Tower at PNC Plaza, which is slated to open in September, will become the greenest skyscraper in the world – without appreciably adding to the overall construction costs. Unlike the smaller Bullitt, the 33-story tower cannot attain net-zero energy status with existing technology. Nevertheless, a glass ‘double-skin’ facade and a solar chimney will enhance the natural ventilation while other built-in efficiencies could lower water and energy consumption levels by 77% and 50%, respectively. “We think by building the greenest high-rise in the world, we’re really helping to put Pittsburgh further on the map,” Saulson says. “We really hope that we’re able to put a stake in the ground, and then have someone take it to the next step.” This series on bold bets is funded by The B Team.

To go further, we in business need for them to set up well-structured financial tools and rules that will give us stability and certainty, unleashing investment in everything from clean energy alternatives to smart infrastructure to agricultural technology. They should also take advantage of plummeting oil prices and continuing low interest rates in developed countries to stop funnelling some $600bn a year in taxpayers’ money to fund fossil fuel subsidies, which often disproportionately benefit the rich who use more energy, investing this money instead in renewable sources and supporting innovation. Not only would this benefit the climate, but begin to address issues of rising social inequality. This is just one example of the climate action agenda and the development agenda are so mutually reinforcing. Powerful vested interests in high-carbon businesses are desperately opposing these changes, using obscure scientific data to question any action, or saying that it is too difficult, too expensive or not necessary. Do not be fooled. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, of which I am a member, issued a report last year showing that the best strategies for pursuing sustainable economic growth go hand in hand with lowering carbon emissions. The world will invest around $90trn in infrastructure in the next 15 years, and the commission, which includes leaders from business, government and academia, including two Nobel laureates, found that better choices in how this is spent will deliver better quality growth as well as a better climate. For example, building new urban transport systems would reduce pollution and generate savings of $3trn over the next 15 years. And restoring just 12% of the world’s degraded lands to productions, we would be able to feed another 200m people and increase farmers’ incomes by $40bn, without having to resort to clearing and burning precious forests. Global business and investors have started taking action. More than a quarter of the world’s top 200 companies have set carbon intensity reduction goals in line with a 6% per year reduction target, while 150 of these companies have several environmental and social goals in place. At the same time, around half of total institutional assets ($45trn) under management now subscribe to responsible investing principles, and climate risk management now needs to become part of investors’ fiduciary duty. But governments’ leadership is needed for lasting change to happen. Last week, together with a group of CEOs from some of the world’s largest companies and civil society organisations – including Sir Richard Branson, Ratan Tata and Mary Robinson – we directly called on world leaders to show leadership and commit to reach a global goal of net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 and embed this goal in an agreement at a summit in Paris later this year. This is key to ensure that we stay within 2C centigrade of warming, averting catastrophic climate change. Failing to act will create a hotter, more volatile planet prone to more severe droughts and floods, impacting people and businesses. Or put another way, we need this goal to spur the kind of investment that we know can save us from a business as usual trajectory. We are already feeling the effects. The UN estimates for example that losses from natural disasters since 2000 have been $2.5trn, at least 50% higher than previous international estimates. And this is just the beginning. This message needs to get to the representatives from around 190 nations who are holding crucial talks in Geneva this week to hash out a draft universal climate deal to be finalised at the Paris summit later this year. Some countries have started taking action. In India, where I was last week, the government realises that it is actually in their self-interest to act. Prime Minister Modi has set out a bold vision for the country to become a leader in solar energy to meet fast rising energy demand, as renewable energy costs are likely to substantially decrease while cost of foreign coal will rise. It is just as well. India is already home to 15 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, and with an expected 50% increase in urbanisation forecast in the next 15 years, the only smart urban strategy is one which decouples economic growth from growth in fossil fuel use. The progress in India follows recent, ground-breaking work and policy announcements in China and the United States. This is now a global movement in which every country and business can play a leadership role. But action from individual global businesses and countries alone, however powerful they may be, will not avert climate change. International collective action is needed instead. Negotiators meeting in Geneva and their should be brave and show political leadership. They can count on the growing number of progressive businesses to support them every step of the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/may/22/shell-boss-endorses-warnings-about-fossil-fuels-and-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T18:31:25Z","webTitle":"Shell boss endorses warnings about fossil fuels and climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/22/shell-boss-endorses-warnings-about-fossil-fuels-and-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/may/22/shell-boss-endorses-warnings-about-fossil-fuels-and-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Shell boss endorses warnings about fossil fuels and climate change","bodyText":"Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Shell, has endorsed warnings that the world’s fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned unless some way is found to capture their carbon emissions. The oil boss has also predicted that the global energy system will become “zero carbon” by the end of the century, with his group obtaining a “very, very large segment” of its earnings from renewable power. And in an admission that the growing opposition to Shell’s controversial search for oil in the Arctic was putting increasing pressure on him, van Beurden admitted he had gone on a “personal journey” to justify the decision to drill. The Shell boss said he accepted the general premise contained in independent studies that have concluded that dangerous levels of global warming above 2C will occur unless CO2 is buried or reserves are kept in the ground. “We cannot burn all the hydrocarbon resources we have on the planet in an unmitigated way and not expect to have a CO2 loading in the atmosphere that is often being linked to the 2C scenario,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. “I am absolutely convinced that without a policy that will really enable and realise CCS (carbon capture and storage) on a large scale, we are not going to be able to stay within that CO2 emission budget.” The admission from the boss of the world’s second largest independently owned oil company comes as the fossil fuel sector comes under unprecedented public pressure to change its business strategy. Shell and BP have been forced to accept shareholder demands to be much more transparent about the impact of their activities on climate change issues at annual general meetings in recent weeks. And in the latest sign of sweeping changes, the energy minister of the world’s number one oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, admitted that his country could wean itself off fossil fuels completely within 25 years. Van Beurden said Shell, along with “a majority of society”, acknowledged that climate change was a real and serious issue. He said it was highly undesirable that the world move beyond 2C. But he argued that talk of a “carbon bubble”, where a large portion of fossil fuel reserves were overvalued because they could not be used, was simplistic: it was necessary to differentiate between higher carbon assets such as coal and lower CO2 ones such as gas. And he said the fast rate of depletion of oil fields meant it was always necessary to find new reserves just to stand still. “All the oil that we have, we will use,” he insisted. “There will still be a need for hydrocarbons for years to come, and the decline in existing production is always going to be faster than the decline that the most successful [low carbon] policies can create. There is always going to be a need for investment.” Some independent surveys have argued that 80% of coal reserves, 50% of gas and 30% of oil would need to be kept in the ground, with high-cost deepwater, Arctic and tar sands projects particularly singled out as likely to be “stranded”. Shell is heavily invested in all these areas and likely to be more so when it acquires its rival BG, for which it has made a $70bn (£45bn) agreed bid. But van Beurden denies that his company is therefore exposed to a carbon bubble. He said some of the opposition to the planned oil exploration this summer in the Alaskan Arctic was emotional and difficult to engage with, but the decision was taken on rational grounds of assessing the technical risks. But the oil company boss admitted that there had been a lot of corporate and individual soul-searching, despite obtaining the go-ahead from the US authorities: “I had to go through a personal journey on that.” Van Beurden reiterated his long-espoused view that there is a moral case in favour of fossil fuels because of the role they can play bringing energy to parts of the world that have not enjoyed the same benefits in the past as the west. Shell is engaged in a number of CCS projects: one at Peterhead in Scotland and another designed to reduce carbon emissions at a tar sand project in Alberta, Canada. The company also claims to be one of the largest renewable energy companies in the world despite spending annually less than $1bn on green schemes out of a total $33bn capital expenditure budget. Van Beurden insisted that he had his hands tied from investing more heavily in CCS because they would not produce the high financial returns that investors had been used to from oil and gas. “I would lose my job over it if I just threw a few billions away [on CCS] … CCS is essential for society and ... is ultimately important for our company, but listen, I have great difficulty to have shareholders focus on the quarter after next.” But he said that the world would move to a zero-carbon energy system by the end of the century, with any fossil fuels having their carbon captured. He said already there were no technological difficulties to doing CCS, just legal, political and other impediments. Van Beurden said renewables, and solar in particular, would become very important for Shell and the world post-2050. “We probably will be working on a very, very large segment of renewable energy,” he explained. “Is there an opportunity or obligation to invest in a low-carbon energy future? Absolutely, but I know that whatever I am going to find as a business model or a technology that will work for me will take decades to pull off. But we have been active participants in solar energy, in wind energy ... in many areas we have been ahead of our time,” he added. The Shell boss justified the company’s continued involvement in climate denial lobby groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council on the grounds that the company supported other aspects of its work. But he also signalled that Shell may withdraw its support by letting its membership lapse, saying they should “watch this space”. British oil companies, plus Statoil of Norway and ENI of Italy, are trying to develop a proactive strategy amid fear that forthcoming UN climate change talks in Paris could come up with new policies that would restrict the way they operate. The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign seeks to persuade the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation to divest themselves of their shareholdings in fossil fuel companies. According to the latest figures, Wellcome held a stake of £142m in Shell as of September 2014. The Gates Foundation held £6m of Shell’s shares at the time of its latest tax filing in 2013. The Shell boss said divestment was a simplistic solution to a wider problem and could delay adopting more meaningful policy options: “I fundamentally do not believe that holds a business rationale.” Van Beurden admitted that for all his concerns about climate change, he still drives a large BMW He explained it was an endorsement of his company’s core activities: “You’ve got to believe in the product.” Note: This article was updated to clarify that Ben Van Beurden was not referring to both renewable energy and CCS when he said Shell could not invest more heavily because of investor pressure, but only CCS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/may/13/solar-farms-lose-uk-government-financial-support-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-13T16:05:00Z","webTitle":"Solar farms to lose UK government financial support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/13/solar-farms-lose-uk-government-financial-support-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/may/13/solar-farms-lose-uk-government-financial-support-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Solar farms to lose UK government financial support","bodyText":"The government is to make drastic changes to its financial support for solar energy farms, in a move condemned by green activists and renewable power companies as likely to reduce the UK's ability to generate low-carbon power and green jobs, and to increase dependency on imports of fossil fuels. It is the second major blow to renewable energy within a month, following the announcement that the Conservatives want to axe subsidies to new onshore windfarms if they win the next election. But the government insisted the changes were necessary in order to ensure subsidies were fair and that renewable energy targets would still be reached, while keeping down costs for consumers. A government spokesman said the new system would be fairer, and create \"the right balance of support for renewables … securing the further investment we need to provide clean, green and secure energy, while continuing to deliver value for money for energy billpayers\". Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said the proposals - which are now out for consultation and are likely to come into force next April - were a \"crippling blow\" to the fledgling solar industry, and unfair because they did not affect other forms of renewable energy. He said: \"The industry will be alarmed by these proposals and surprised to be singled out for harsh treatment.\" Alasdair Cameron, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the plans would further harm the prospects for the solar industry, which has suffered repeated upheavals in the past four years as the coalition government has tinkered with the subsidy system. He said: \"Financial support for solar has already fallen, and any further reductions should only be carried out in a planned way as [the] costs [of the equipment] drop. But suddenly pulling the rug out from under a popular growing clean energy industry makes no sense, and would put thousands of jobs at risk.\" The UK currently has about 2.7GW of solar energy generation, enough to power about 620,000 homes. The government said its proposals would keep the UK on track for its new target of having about 10 to 12GW of capacity in 2020 – itself a large decrease on estimates in 2012 by the Department of Energy and Climate Change that the UK could have 20GW of solar power by the end of the decade. Large solar farms, above 5MW – enough to cover about 15 football pitches – will bear the brunt of the reforms. Some of these have been controversial with local people in rural areas, from Suffolk to Devon. Instead of receiving a direct payment in relation to the amount of power they generate, in future these farms will be forced to compete with other sources of renewable energy such as onshore wind turbines and energy-from-waste plants, for a limited pot of available cash that is ultimately paid by energy consumers. But this system – known as \"contracts for difference\" under the government's electricity market reforms – is complex and offputting, according to solar companies, as well as creating uncertainty as to their future returns, which may deter investors. The move is being seen as another victory for the right-wing of the Conservative party, many of whom are opposed to what the prime minister has been alleged to call \"green crap\", such as renewable energy measures that add to consumer bills. In March, the Tory energy minister Michael Fallon declared to parliament that there would be no further changes to the \"renewable obligation\" - the old system of subsidy that benefited solar farms - before 2017. Solar companies alleged on Tuesday that he had made a major U-turn. Amid the bad news for big solar installations, there were crumbs of comfort for smaller scale renewables. Community solar energy projects, with people clubbing together to put up panels in their local area, will be allowed to double their size, from 5MW to 10MW, and people who choose to put solar panels on their roofs can expect a bigger share of the subsidy pot than farmers and other large property owners who choose ground-mounted models."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/29/sunpower-programme-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-28T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"British plan to avert climate disaster using sun power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/29/sunpower-programme-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/29/sunpower-programme-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"British plan to avert climate disaster using sun power","bodyText":"Two of Britain's leading scientists have urged the setting up of a world Sunpower Programme to deliver solar electricity that is cheaper than fossil fuel power by 2025. All countries should be invited to participate, says Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser, and the economist Lord Richard Layard in an article in the Observer. The programme's target would be the development of techniques that see solar electricity generate at least 10% of the world's total energy supply by 2025, and 25% by 2030. King and Layard's proposal has been put forward in the wake of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on the likely impact of climate change, triggered by rising carbon emissions. The world desperately needs to wean itself off its fossil fuel habits and find fresh, renewable methods for generating electricity. Nuclear power and wind energy have potential but face political problems. By contrast, solar energy holds vast promise, they say. \"The sun sends energy to the earth equal to about 5,000 times our total energy needs. It is inconceivable that we cannot collect enough of this energy for our needs, at a reasonable cost.\" They acknowledge that a number of scientific breakthroughs will be needed to make cheap solar energy a global prospect. In particular, scientists will have to find ways to reduce the cost of transmitting electricity from areas of high luminosity and low land value to the major population centres of the world. This will require new materials that are much better at conducting electricity, without loss of power, than present methods. This would be a major aim of the new solar energy programme. The proposal to set up the Sunpower Programme comes as campaigners, politicians and business leaders have called for \"immediate action\" on climate change after the starkest warning yet that manmade global warming is leading to catastrophic and irreversible consequences. Leading scientists at the IPCC meeting in Stockholm last week said they were \"95% certain\" that climate change was occurring and caused by human actions. IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri said: \"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.\" Connie Hedegaard, the EU's commissioner for climate action, said: \"What would you do if your doctor was 95% sure you had a serious illness? Whose side are you on? Those who want to act on 95% certainty or those who gamble on the remaining 5%?\" The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, invited world leaders to a summit next year to formulate a plan. \"We must act now,\" he urged. The IPCC reported that the world was on course for a rise in temperatures of more than 2C by the end of the century, causing heatwaves, droughts, sea level rises and extreme rainfall. Nations have set their own targets for curbing greenhouse gases but experts say these are inadequate to meet the reductions required. Samantha Smith of the World Wildlife Fund said: \"We must act or face frightening new impacts. We know that most of the pollution that causes climate change comes from burning fossil fuels. WWF calls on governments and investors to stop investing in dirty energy and start an immediate and just transition by investing in renewables.\" Mindy Lubber, who heads a US coalition of financial investors committed to tackling climate change, said: \"The IPCC's conclusion is unequivocal – climate change is happening\" Nick Robins, head of HSBC's climate change centre of excellence, warned: \"We are putting the weather on steroids. We know that temperatures continue to warm and that impacts are fully in line with what we would expect from a warming world, including rising sea levels and melting glaciers. And this is affecting economies today. Our research shows that India, China, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil are the G20 nations that are most vulnerable to climate risks.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/feb/18/great-barrier-reef-polluters-face-tougher-action-under-queenslands-new-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-17T21:28:01Z","webTitle":"Great Barrier Reef polluters face tougher action under Queensland's new government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/18/great-barrier-reef-polluters-face-tougher-action-under-queenslands-new-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/feb/18/great-barrier-reef-polluters-face-tougher-action-under-queenslands-new-government","fields":{"headline":"Great Barrier Reef polluters face tougher action under Queensland's new government","bodyText":"The Queensland government may adopt tough new regulations to tackle the amount of pollution flowing onto the Great Barrier Reef, with the state’s first ever reef minister vowing to strengthen protections to avoid the ecosystem being listed as “in danger” by the UN. The new Labor government has promised to slash the amount of nitrogen flowing on to the reef from key catchments by 80% by 2025, while also cutting total suspended sediment reaching the reef by 50% by the same year. While some progress has been made in encouraging farmers to change practices to stop harmful chemicals running off their land on to the reef, Labor has indicated new regulations may be introduced to achieve its targets. “I don’t want to pre-empt any discussions but there are a range of levers available, from regulation to education to innovation and we’ll be looking to all of those to make sure it works,” Steven Miles, Queensland’s newly-appointed environment minister told Guardian Australia. Miles has also been given the new title of minister for the Great Barrier Reef. “It’s certainly a big job to achieve those ambitious targets and we need to find ways to do it,” Miles said. “We are working out the details now. But we will work with all the stakeholders involved. “We think there needs to be a substantial improvement in the quality of water running into the world heritage area. I don’t want to disparage previous efforts on this, but we want to really aggressively reduce run-off.” Unesco’s world heritage committee will meet in June to decide whether to list the reef, which is in declining health, as “in danger”. Miles said he would ensure Labor’s new reef policies will be submitted to the UN this month for consideration. “The in-danger listing is a real possibility, it’s something we’re concerned about,” he said. “It’s not just the optics of it, but the fact the reef will actually be in danger. Our approach will be guided by the science to convince the scientists at the world heritage committee that we have a strong plan.” A federal government-commissioned report last year warned while a voluntary approach to reducing pollution had worked with some land managers, there is no “urgent reason for action” for those who don’t want to take part. “It is widely acknowledged that agricultural land use in catchments that drain into the Great Barrier Reef is largely ungoverned by the suite of legislative and regulatory arrangements in place,” the report states. While the previous Liberal National party government stressed it was spending $35m a year to improve water quality, its scientists reportedly warned that the reliance on voluntary schemes had proven ineffective, with the amount of pesticides flowing on to the reef causing feminisation in some male fish. Chemicals such as nitrogen are also thought to spur the growth of crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat their way through reef systems. According to the federal government, around half of horticulture and cane growers are improving their practices, with the sediment load falling by 11% in the past five years. Labor has promised $100m to improve water quality over the next five years, although this is far short of the amount required, according to the groups that oversee the catchments flowing onto the reef. The new state government has also pledged to halt the dumping of dredged sediment in the reef’s world heritage area, as well as scrap an LNP plan to dump spoil from the expanded Abbot Point port on to the nearby Caley Valley wetlands, which is regarded as nationally significant area for wildlife. Adani, the Indian mining firm that wants to create Australia’s largest mine and ship the coal from Abbot Point, is keen to press ahead with the dredging, but the process will be delayed until a new dumping site is found. “The dumping had to stop now as the plan for proponents of the Abbot Point coal terminal was to be dredging in March, which was a very imminent threat,” said Miles. “They certainly won’t be dredging in March. We are looking for an environmentally responsible place to put it. “We are committed to working with the business community to deliver economic growth but people clearly voted for a government that won’t dump spoil on sensitive wetlands. We were elected on that platform and we have to work out other options, but I won’t put timelines on that.” Miles said he was “clearly concerned” about climate change, which has been cited by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority as the leading long-term challenge for the reef, but that water quality and dumping are the two most immediate threats to the ecosystem. The new environment minister said a commission will be set up to assess feed-in tariffs for solar energy, in order to meet a Labor goal of one million solar rooftops by 2020. Separately, Labor has committed to banning uranium mining in Queensland, while Miles said he’d have “serious concerns” about any proposal to dump nuclear waste in the state. Dermot O’Gorman, chief executive of WWF Australia, said it was an “important signal” that Queensland now has a minister for the Great Barrier Reef and that the new protections for the reef were “urgent”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2013/nov/03/lesley-yellowlees-solar-energy-research","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-03T00:05:00Z","webTitle":"Lesley Yellowlees: 'I saw something no one else had seen'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/03/lesley-yellowlees-solar-energy-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2013/nov/03/lesley-yellowlees-solar-energy-research","fields":{"headline":"Lesley Yellowlees: 'I saw something no one else had seen'","bodyText":"Governments the world over may be rubbing their hands at the possibilities of Arctic drilling and fracking for fossil fuels, but Lesley Yellowlees remains unimpressed. \"Oil is much more valuable to us for feedstock chemicals; we shouldn't be burning it anyway,\" she exclaims, with her trademark blend of determination, passion and authority. For Yellowlees, the answer to the energy crisis lies in renewable energy, with dye-sensitised solar cells playing a major role. It's an area she has devoted over 30 years of research to, through her pioneering work developing dyes and investigating their electronic properties. However, the quest for solar energy is far from over. \"It is of vital importance to us, and we still haven't cracked it,\" she says. Energy is something Yellowlees has in abundance. A leading figure in the fields of spectroelectrochemistry and solar energy research, she is professor of inorganic electrochemistry at Edinburgh University, a passionate champion for diversity in science and has an MBE for services to science. She is also vice-principal and head of the College of Science and Engineering at Edinburgh and president of the Royal Society of Chemistry – the first woman to hold the position in its 172-year history. Which makes it all the more surprising that she hadn't planned an academic career at all. Although she spent much of her childhood, and most of her career, in Edinburgh, Yellowlees was born in London – \"within the sound of Bow bells, so I think I'm technically a cockney\". The family initially lived in Newcastle before moving to Edinburgh, where her love of science and mathematics blossomed. After graduating with a first in chemical physics from the University of Edinburgh, Yellowlees felt she had had her fill of science, and left to work as an administrator in the NHS. She remained there for a year, before moving to Brisbane with her husband, Peter, to work on solar energy research. It was to prove a life-changing experience. There was, however, a hitch. \"If I was going to get anywhere doing research, I needed a PhD,\" she explains. Balking at the prospect of a six-year programme in Australia, Yellowlees decided on a three-year PhD in the UK. \"Peter got an offer of a very good job back in Edinburgh, and I missed my family, so we came back.\" Returning to the UK to do a three-year PhD at Edinburgh University, she began work on dye-sensitised solar cells – technology that is showing promise in the creation of cheap, lightweight, flexible solar panels. These cells make use of coloured molecules that absorb energy from the sun's rays, exciting their electrons. These electrons then flow from the dye molecules through a circuit, producing a current. To optimise the solar cells, it is vital to understand the electron transfer processes taking place. To do this, Yellowlees became an expert in electrochemistry – a technique that allows scientists to add or remove electrons from a material and investigate the consequences. Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video She soon realised that it would be possible to delve deeper by combining electrochemistry with other spectroscopic techniques – a field known as spectroelectrochemistry. With a focus on highly coloured ruthenium-based dyes, she was particularly interested in how the gain or loss of electrons changes the wavelengths of light absorbed by the dye. It was now that Yellowlees achieved her first major breakthrough. \"I saw something nobody else had seen – it all made sense and all just came together,\" she recalls. The ruthenium dye she was working on could accept three electrons, added sequentially. But Yellowlees discovered that each electron adds to a separate region of the dye, rather than being spread out over the whole molecule. \"I still remember thinking: 'This is great; this is just what I am doing this for… it's just fabulous'.\" Her first spectroelectrochemical equipment worked for her systems that were stable at room temperature; but there was a snag. \"Most systems are not stable at room temperature – if you change the number of electrons on them they just fall to bits,\" she says. With a PhD and a taste of success, Yellowlees became a pioneer in the field of spectroelectrochemistry – developing spectroelectrochemical cells for low-temperature measurements looking at the absorption of UV or visible light, and combining electrochemistry with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Using this technique \"you can pick up which part of the molecule the electron is most closely associated with,\" she explains – and that is crucial knowledge when it comes to designing a dye for solar cells. \"What you want to do is to make sure when you excite this electron with light that it goes on to the part of the molecule that is most closely associated with your electrode, because then you get good electron transfer,\" she says. Yellowlees's work has won her an international reputation and has enabled her, and others, to understand how to optimise the structure of dyes for solar cells, and to investigate a host of other systems where electron transfer processes occur, from liquid crystals to vitamin B12. Recent work has focused on miniaturising spectroelectrochemical cells for use in advanced EPR experiments. In 2012, Yellowlees was appointed president of the Royal Society of Chemistry. \"It's a fantastic job, it's a real privilege to do it,\" she says. Her involvement with the society has been extensive over the years, ranging from chairing the science and technology board to shaping the curriculum, as part of the Scottish education section; she has also chaired the editorial board of the magazine Chemistry World. Yellowlees has a clear focus. \"I think widening participation in education is a huge area that we need to look at,\" she says. \"Education shouldn't depend upon where you live, or how much you earn, or what colour you are, or what sex you are.\" Her own department has achieved an Athena Swan silver award for good practice in supporting women in science. Now, as president of the RSC, she has been challenging institutions to change what she sees as a problematic culture. \"I don't think it has to be a gender thing,\" she says. \"If you can change the culture it benefits everybody – it's just that women benefit disproportionately better.\" A long-hours mentality, she argues, is part of the problem. \"You can't tell me that people who spend 14 hours a day in a lab are spending all those 14 hours productively.\" One thing she would like to see the government weigh in on is the promotion of flexible working hours. And while Yellowlees's presidency comes to an end next summer, there's little chance of her energy waning. \"My automatic response is to say 'yes' when someone comes to me with a new project,\" she says. Her mantra? \"To give back, and to give back 10 times what I've got.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/jan/06/senate-republicans-introduce-bill-to-force-construction-keystone-pipeline","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-06T12:00:11Z","webTitle":"Senate Republicans to try to force construction of Keystone pipeline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/06/senate-republicans-introduce-bill-to-force-construction-keystone-pipeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/jan/06/senate-republicans-introduce-bill-to-force-construction-keystone-pipeline","fields":{"headline":"Senate Republicans to try to force construction of Keystone pipeline","bodyText":"Republicans will introduce a bill on Tuesday to force construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, setting the new Congress on a collision course with the White House over Barack Obama’s environmental agenda. The Keystone XL bill aims to take the decision about the controversial pipeline out of the president’s hands. It is seen as the first shot in an all-out Republican offensive against the Democratic president’s environmental and health agenda. The bill is expected to pass but it faces a potential veto from Obama. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who is the incoming head of the Senate energy committee, planned to introduce the bill on Tuesday, with hearings scheduled for Wednesday and a vote on the floor as early as next week, spokesman Robert Dillon said. Murkowski’s bill would bypass the State Department, which has authority over the Keystone project, and grant immediate approval to TransCanada Corporation to “construct, connect, operate and maintain the pipeline”. The legislation faces challenges from Republicans as well as Democrats pushing to attach various riders to the bill. Republicans were considering measures that would block or delay Obama’s plans to curb carbon pollution from power plants. Such provisions, it is thought, would be even more likely to incur a presidential veto. Dillon said Murkowski was focused on just moving ahead. “Her hope is to have a clean bill for Keystone so that we can get this out of the gate,” he said. “We just want to get it moved and through the floor, and to the president.” Democrats meanwhile were considering a number of potential riders of their own, including measures that would force the Canadian company building the pipeline to keep all of the oil that flows through it in the US and use only US steel in its construction, and another that would expand financial incentives for solar energy. With Democrats now holding only 46 votes in the Senate, however, these were unlikely to pass. The final outcome of the bill will almost certainly depend on whether Obama uses his veto power. The senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said repeatedly he intends to make Keystone the first order of business in the new Republican-controlled Congress. The project, designed to deliver up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the tar sands of Alberta to refineries on the Texas gulf coast, has become a flash point for the broader debate about climate change. The pipeline has faced repeated delays since TransCanada first proposed it seven years ago. The State Department will not render its final decision until later this year, after the courts in Nebraska resolve a dispute over the pipeline’s route. Republicans have voted repeatedly to force approval of the pipeline. With the new Republican majority sworn in to the Senate on Tuesday, party leaders are confident they now have more than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster and pass legislation. A similar bill last November fell one vote short of the 60-senator threshold. Obama has repeatedly downplayed the benefits of the project but he has not said outright he would kill Keystone. The White House refused to commit to a veto on Monday. “We’ll see what the legislation actually includes before we start urging people to vote one way or the other,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said. But campaigners are increasingly hopeful that Obama will veto the bill. In his year-end news conference last month, the president repeatedly downplayed Keystone’s purported economic benefits and said the pipeline would do more for Canadian oil companies than US consumers. “I think there’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the US economy, and it’s hard to see on paper where they’re getting their information from,” he said. The pipeline has been a recurring headache for the White House. Environmental campaigners say that if Obama is serious about climate change, he must block Keystone and stop Canada from expanding production of the oil from its tar sands that would flow through the pipeline, which is a far dirtier fuel source than conventional crude oil. The November attempt to force construction of the pipeline – a gamble by the Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu – saw a number of Democrats supporting the project but still came up one vote short of the 60 required. The defeat ended Landrieu’s hopes of hanging on to her seat in a run-off election. Republicans believe they have since picked up more votes from new senators such as West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito and Iowa’s Joni Ernst. But not even TransCanada officials believe there are the numbers in the Senate to overcome a presidential veto – should Obama decide to exercise that authority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2015/apr/02/c40-latin-america-climate-resilience-green-copenhagen","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-02T17:39:26Z","webTitle":"Everyone praises green Copenhagen.

But what if your city has 20m people?","bodyText":"“There will be roughly 1 billion more people living in cities by 2030,” said Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri at the C40 Latin American Mayors Forum in the Argentinian capital last week. “Which is equivalent to creating a Buenos Aires-sized city every three weeks for the next 15 years.” The big question, as Macri and other mayors agreed at the forum, is: how do cities accommodate this high population expansion in a sustainable way? We often hear the looming figure that 70% of the world’s population will be living in cities by 2050 – yet that’s a milestone Latin America has already reached. It is the most urbanised region in the world. Do its cities champion ideas that are up to the task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing climate change resilience? Judge for yourself. 1. Climate resilience is not bad for the economy “It’s a false dilemma,” Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, told the gathering. While many governments shy away from cutting greenhouse gas emissions for economic reasons, Calderón argued that renewable, low-carbon options can actually generate far greater economic growth in the long run. And they’re not as costly as they once were. “The cost of solar energy has reduced by around 90% since the 1990s,” he pointed out. “Renewables are now highly competitive.” 2. Act quickly Committing to increasing sustainability is not enough: cities need to act quickly. “We need to be faster in the implementation of climate resilience strategies,” argued the mayor of Mexico City, Miguel Mancera. His city recently kicked off a 2014-2020 climate action programme, which promises to reduce pollutant emissions in the metropolitan area by 30% over six years. Since the programme started in June 2014, he claimed CO2 has already been cut by 1m tonnes. Of course, investment is a critical part of this, and many mayors called on national governments to support them in funding renewable energies and low-carbon infrastructure. Rio de Janeiro’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, argued that incentives were needed for the private sector to invest in sustainable, climate-resilient cities. 3. We need a transport revolution Mexico City is one of the most polluted cities in the world – and 56% of its emissions are from transport. As we look to mature beyond the dominance of the private car, rethinking our urban transport is a clear focus for climate resilience – in both Latin American cities and around the world. As Felipe Calderón outlined, the benefits of cleaner and collective transport go beyond decelerating climate change: there are huge economic and health costs of polluting traffic in cities. “It is critical to reduce car use,” he urged. “No big city in the world is complying with air pollution limits.” Efficient public transport is one part of this transport evolution; safe cycling infrastructure, pedestrianisation and electric vehicles are also critical. Latin America is well known for the widespread use of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, which originated in the Brazilian city of Curitiba. Curitiba continues to innovate with micro electric cars, as well as electric taxis and buses – in addition to expanding their BRT and improving cycling infrastructure. Mexico City is currently expanding their Metrobus network as well as their metro system. In 2013, Buenos Aires transformed its car-dominated 20-lane wide Avenida 9 de Julio in the city centre by giving over the 4 central lanes to a Metrobus system, which – according to the city government – saves the equivalent of 5,612 tons of C02 emissions annually. The Argentinian capital’s protected bicycle lanes (“bicisendas”), introduced in 2009, now span 138km and the city’s bike-share scheme, the first in Argentina when it began in 2010, currently has over 140,000 registered users. By improving cycle provision and infrastructure, the city has seen bicycle use increase greatly. Encouraging walking is another part of curbing car use. “We need to instil a greater respect for the pedestrian,” urged the mayor of Quito, who is pedestrianising areas of the city in addition to expanding its network of bike lanes and adding electric bikes to their bike share programme. Latin American cities including Quito, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City also joined C40 cities around the world to sign the Clean Bus Declaration of Intent, expressing a commitment to reduce emissions and improve air quality through the introduction of low- and zero-emission buses in their city fleets. 4. Get better at waste Landfills contribute to greenhouse gas emissions – and transporting waste to these landfills contributes further to pollution. As populations and resultant consumption grows, efficient waste management was agreed to be a vital part of more sustainable cities. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC) is working with cities including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo on the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) initiative which aims to reduce methane and air pollution through the dissemination and implementation of best practice waste management policies and strategies such as closing open dumps and capturing landfill gas. São Paulo’s creation of a solid waste management plan has been a participatory process, promoting a practice of “shared responsibility” as well as maximum recovery of waste. The city now has two recycling plants receiving 250 tonnes of waste per day; there is also a recycling fund for 1200 cooperatives and organic waste management is incentivised. Impressive stuff – though São Paulo certainly has other pressing issues that need addressing. 5. Support compact, efficient cities “The traditional model of urban expansion is no longer sustainable,” Felipe Calderón announced. While a contentious topic in the London housing crisis debate, the UK capital’s green belt was praised by Latin American leaders as a positive strategy for curbing the risk of limitless urban expansion. Compact cities, it was argued, increase energy efficiency, maximise land use, reduce travelling distances within the city (then reducing the need for individual car use if public transport is in place) - as well as preserving nature. Of course with the anticipated rate of urbanisation and population expansion, compact cities mean much denser cities. While compact (and relatively low population) European cities like Copenhagen were praised as a positive model, it was admitted that extremely dense cities like Hong Kong were not good examples. The question remains, of course, of how you can have a metropolitan region as big as, for instance, that of Mexico’s capital – home to 21 million people – and make it feel and function like Copenhagen’s, home to 2 million. For now, in Latin America as in many other parts of the world, the jury’s out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/jun/02/mexico-oil-companies-reforms-gas-hydrocarbon","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T20:43:09Z","webTitle":"Energy reform: will Mexico's newest revolution boost renewables – or just fossil fuels?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/02/mexico-oil-companies-reforms-gas-hydrocarbon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/02/mexico-oil-companies-reforms-gas-hydrocarbon","fields":{"headline":"Energy reform: will Mexico's newest revolution boost renewables – or just fossil fuels?","bodyText":"For the first time since 1938, the world’s largest oil companies are preparing to invest in Mexico. The last time they were there, things ended badly: President Lázaro Cárdenas seized their assets, created state-owned oil monopoly Petróleos Mexicanos – or Pemex – and sent foreign competitors packing. Now, 77 years later, Mexico is inviting them back. As part of its far-reaching hydrocarbon and electricity reforms, the country is reopening its largely untapped oil and natural gas reserves to foreign investors and competitors. The process will begin in earnest in mid-July with an initial auction of 14 oil exploration areas in the Gulf of Mexico. More than two dozen companies, including global energy giants ExxonMobil, Chevron and Total, as well as Pemex, are lined up to bid next month after Mexico’s oil regulator prequalified them last week. But as the country moves forward, questions remain. Will the breakup of Mexico’s decades-old monopolies and the arrival of new oil, gas and power players lead to renewed growth and investment across the economy? And will they cause a new host of problems, including increased environmental damage? ‘Building a better country’ Mexico’s momentous policy shift was enabled by several controversial new laws and constitutional amendments that were approved over the last year. “Reforms are the foundation for building a better country,” said Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking last month at the World Energy Forum on Latin America, held in Quintana Roo. “They are a platform for beginning a new stage of development.” Not everyone is excited about the new development, however. Environmental groups including Greenpeace have expressed concern over increasing oil and gas exploitation in Mexico. In March, Greenpeace blasted the UK government over a $1bn investment involving Pemex and other fossil fuel companies. But the energy business can have a positive impact, says Eduardo Reyes Bravo, a Mexico-based director of infrastructure and energy strategy with PricewaterhouseCoopers. “One of the key elements of the reform is to enable competition in the market,” he said. “Competition should bring better prices to industry, which, in turn, can be more competitive, increasing exports, generating new employment and reducing prices in the local market. The reform measures aim to boost competition, and the government and energy companies claim they can improve Mexicans’ economic opportunities, environmental protections, health and trust in their institutions. “If we really want to achieve change in these [corrupt] practices, then this has to be a structural change throughout society,” Peña Nieto said. “We have to be the government that knocks down the walls that are in the way of our achieving a more equitable and just society.” ‘Change does not happen overnight’ Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and professor at Columbia University who co-chaired the World Economic Forum on Latin America, called Mexico’s reforms – which also encompass education, telecommunications and finance – “very impressive”. He said: “I’m very optimistic that these really will spur economic growth.” Stiglitz also said he was pleased that energy reform included a development trust, funded with petroleum income. Banco de México, the country’s central bank, will manage the fund, which will support pensions, science and technology, infrastructure investments, and scholarships. It could become a substantial development asset if managed properly, Stiglitz said. Mexico expects $62.5bn of new foreign investment into its energy sector in the next three years. Direct action by energy companies that result from the reforms will also have an enormous impact on Mexico’s development in the years to come. In a report released this year, investment research firm Sustainalytics predicts Pemex will improve its subpar track record on health, safety and corruption, as it transitions from a government agency into a company competing with global corporations that have higher standards on such issues. “As Pemex looks to stay relevant and participate with Western integrated oil majors in joint ventures, we expect a rapid ‘catch-up’ process will be required in terms of both technological modernization and [environmental, social and governance] management,” the authors wrote. “Change does not happened overnight, but we are off to a good start,” Pemex boss Emilio Lozoya said at the World Economic Forum. Lozoya did not directly address allegations of corruption at Pemex, or the company’s recent fatal explosions at offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. In response to concerns over growing greenhouse gas emissions if Mexico produces more oil and gas, the Pemex chief executive said the country could boost its fossil fuel consumption without increasing emissions by continuing its “tremendous transition” from oil to natural gas in power generation, saying gas is “at least half less polluting”. (In actuality, lifecycle carbon emissions from natural gas come to about 28% less than those from oil, according to the UK Forestry Commission’s Biomass Energy Centre.) Pemex is involved in a joint venture with US-based investment management company BlackRock and private equity firm First Reserve to build a pipeline to bring Texas-produced natural gas to Mexico. A renewable future? Mexico’s reforms will also create new competition for electricity monopoly Comisión Federal de Electricidad, or CFE. The new market rules – still in draft form – are intended to open up power generation to all participants and guarantee nondiscriminatory access to the electric grid. They also aim to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy through new market incentives, auctions and a clearly defined annual roadmap to reach 35% clean energy by 2024. Big questions still surround the role of renewables. On one hand, high-efficiency natural gas units that generate both heat and power – so-called cogeneration plants – qualify as clean energy under the reform. But when it comes to renewable energy’s potential to contribute to Mexico’s development, Lozoya sounded a pessimistic note. “Everybody wants more renewable energy, but the technology and price are still not aligned,” he said. Not surprisingly, solar energy entrepreneurs in Mexico disagreed, saying the reforms would help their industry make a difference. Javier Romero, a board member of Mexico’s national solar association, says solar companies can take advantage of the reform’s new clean energy certificates to help fund projects and new wholesale electricity market rules. These allow “qualified users” such as commercial and industrial businesses to buy power directly from solar power plants or other independent generators, instead of only from CFE. “The photovoltaic sector will benefit the population generating clean energy with zero emissions, with more jobs within the industry’s production chain and finally with cheaper energy to the final consumer,” Romero said. Outside investors agree that energy reform offers potential for renewables. “Mexico’s energy reform is a real revolution,” Ignacio Sánchez Galán, chief executive of Spanish energy group Iberdrola, said at the forum. One of the few foreign energy companies already operating in the country, Iberdrola has committed to investing about $5bn in wind farms and combined-cycle natural gas plants in Mexico by 2018. Hector Olea, whose company Gauss Energía developed Mexico’s largest solar power plant in La Paz, Baja California Sur, says the reform will help position Mexico “to be the next boom in solar”, fueled by prices on par with wind and even some conventional generation sources. Olea says the reform’s new rules will help solar play a much larger role in Mexico’s development. “There are so many different benefits for Mexico. We are very optimistic, but we have to wait until the final rules are settled.” As Mexico’s competitive energy markets take shape and foreign oil companies re-enter the country for the first time in almost eight decades, it remains to be seen whether the emerging business community can really bring Mexicans the cleaner energy, greater economic opportunity, improved health and safety, and more transparent transactions promised in this reform.

So while it nominally faces many of the same challenges as other BRIC nations – water scarcity, dirty energy supplies, human rights issues – India’s population density makes its situation exponentially more difficult. A World Bank study in 2014 found that environmental degradation like air pollution, water pollution, deforestation and natural disasters cost India $80bn per year, or nearly 6% of its economic activity. Of that total, 52% is attributable to air pollution. If you thought China’s smog was bad, Delhi’s air pollution levels can be twice as high, with even less government action to show for it. India’s air pollution is not only far worse than any of the other BRICs, it is so intense that it is reducing plants’ ability to photosynthesize sunlight, cutting crop yields in half. While pollution is a broad problem across India, poverty and general lack of access to basic human needs is more of a first order problem, and one that draws the lion’s share of attention from government, businesses and people. In 2012, just 36% of India’s population had access to improved sanitation, leading the nation’s minister of rural development to call India “the world’s capital for open defecations”. As a result, much of the sustainable development discussion in India has focused on inclusion and bringing the population into the 21st century. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Clean India Mission, a five-year effort to eliminate open defecation, provide access to improved sanitation, and clean up the River Ganges, among other targets. Corporations have joined up with the Clean India Mission, committing to invest in education for girls and adopting communities for cleanup, among others. Domestic and multinational corporations have been important partners for a range of India’s sustainable development efforts, although most of these business efforts tend to be focused locally or regionally. But in 2013, India became the first country in the world to mandate corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, with a world-leading corporate law that requires about 8,000 companies in India to invest 2% of its profits per year on CSR programs. The resulting investment could mean as much as $2bn per year will be invested in poverty reduction, environmental and social programs. The law similarly emphasizes that companies invest in areas local to its operations. Plenty of debate remains about the current and future impacts of India’s CSR law and whether it will end up being a net good for the nation or simply result in check-the-box CSR practices. But one aspect of the law stipulates that the investments can not be part of the company’s normal operations, or solely benefit of the company’s employees. This condition could potentially prevent companies from investing in projects with both business and community benefits – such as switching from coal to renewable energy. Even if the CSR law doesn’t spur investment in energy efficiency or green building, some companies are taking that step on their own, and are trying to spread the word about the many business benefits. Information technology company Infosys pioneered an effort in 2014 to raise the profile of green building technologies among Indian firms. When it undertook an expansion of its campus in Hyderabad, the company built one to traditional standards and one with energy efficiency at its core. The resulting green building, which earned Leed Platinum certification, uses 38% less energy than its counterpart, and cost 1% less to build. Building green as India expands is one example of the leapfrogging potential that all developing economies can benefit from. Rather than using 20th century building practices and then retrofitting for efficiency down the line, building green from the start could enable companies and the country to make more rapid progress towards their sustainability goals. Another big area where India could advance more quickly than the rest of the world is in embracing renewable energy. India is perennially energy-starved – only 75% of the population has reliable access to electricity – and has an eye on its Himalayan neighbors’ bountiful hydropower resources. In one of a number of large-scale Himalayan hydropower projects in the pipeline in Nepal, for instance, Bangalore-based infrastructure firm GMR Group in September signed a $1.4 bn deal to develop a 900-megawatt hydropower project on the upper Karnali River. Unfortunately, negotiating international hydropower deals is a complex endeavor that involves not only energy generation but also access to water among other water-scarce countries downstream such as Bangladesh. As a result, India is also making inroads into solar energy. During the UN climate talks in Lima, Peru, last fall, Modi announced a massive solar commitment: 100 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2022, creating as many as 1m jobs and giving rural Indians access to cheap, clean energy and greater economic opportunity as a result. As India’s population continues to grow – a UN report in 2012 projected the country would be the world’s most populous by 2028 – both rural and urban areas will need infrastructure upgrades and new energy generation. As the population urbanizes, cities will expand and newer cities will arise, but existing cities can also be transformed to absorb more residents. In this way, India has a slight advantage over China when it comes to sustainability: in India’s biggest cities, which predate the rise of the automobile, it may be easier to incorporate forward looking, sustainable mobility infrastructure than in newer cities. The World Business Council on Sustainable Development’s Sustainable Mobility program works in six cities around the world to create next generation transportation options, and unlike newer, auto-centric cities like Chengdu, China, the Indian city of Indore can’t upgrade its auto infrastructure without knocking down large parts of the city, making the transition to less carbon-intensive transportation options more attractive. Although India is largely occupied with its own domestic problems, there are plenty of countries that live in its shadow. Nepal figures prominently – not only in the wake of last month’s devastating earthquake, but also because of the energy-development partnerships and close cultural ties between India and Nepal. India’s membership in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ties it closely to Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan on economic and social issues, and it also must negotiate water and energy policies among those neighbors. Meanwhile, India is in constant competition with neighboring China and Pakistan. The Modi government has recently taken steps to limit the influence that other countries can have in India, particularly the UK and US. Last month, the Indian government used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to freeze Greenpeace’s bank accounts, accusing the nonprofit of encouraging “anti-development protest”. The Ford Foundation was put on a similar watchlist two weeks later. These moves echo actions against international NGOs taking place in Russia, and could complicate the trajectory of sustainable development in growth-minded India. But if India can find a sustainable path forward, it could certainly play a big role in helping other countries – especially those with densely populated megacities – do the same."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-11T00:53:00Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace apologises to people of Peru over Nazca lines stunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace apologises to people of Peru over Nazca lines stunt","bodyText":"Greenpeace has apologised to the people of Peru after the government accused the environmentalists of damaging ancient earth markings in the country’s coastal desert by leaving footprints in the ground during a publicity stunt meant to send a message to the UN climate talks delegates in Lima. A spokesman for Greenpeace said: “Without reservation Greenpeace apologises to the people of Peru for the offence caused by our recent activity laying a message of hope at the site of the historic Nazca lines. We are deeply sorry for this. “Rather than relay an urgent message of hope and possibility to the leaders gathering at the Lima UN climate talks, we came across as careless and crass.” Earlier Peru’s vice-minister for culture Luis Jaime Castillo had accused Greenpeace of “extreme environmentalism” and ignoring what the Peruvian people “consider to be sacred” after the protest at the world renowned Nazca lines, a Unesco world heritage site. He said the government was seeking to prevent those responsible from leaving the country while it asked prosecutors to file charges of attacking archaeological monuments, a crime punishable by up to six years in prison. The activists had entered a strictly prohibited area beside the figure of a hummingbird among the lines, the culture ministry said, and they had laid down big yellow cloth letters reading “Time for Change! The Future is Renewable” as the UN climate talks began in Peru’s capital. “This has been done without any respect for our laws. It was done in the middle of the night. They went ahead and stepped on our hummingbird, and looking at the pictures we can see there’s very severe damage,” Castillo said. “Nobody can go on these lines without permission – not even the president of Peru!” Peruvian authorities are also seeking the identity of the archaeologist who led the activists to the site and the plane from which the photos of the stunt were taken, he said. “It was thoughtless, insensitive, illegal, irresponsible and absolutely pre-meditated. Greenpeace has said it was planning this action for months.” Tina Loeffelbein, a Greenpeace spokeswoman at the summit, said she was not aware of any legal proceedings being brought against the group. She said Greenpeace was cooperating with the Peruvian authorities and seeking to clarify what took place. In a statement Greenpeace said it was concerned that it could have caused “moral offence to the Peruvian people”. The statement read: “Our history of more than 40 years of peaceful activism clearly shows that we have always been most respectful with people around the world and their diverse cultural legacies.” Castillo responded: “Disrespecting humanity’s cultural heritage – I don’t think that’s the message this summit or Greenpeace is trying to spread to the world! Most of us in the cultural sector agree with the message. But the means don’t justify the ends.” “We took every care we could to try and avoid any damage. We have 40 years of experience of doing peaceful protests,” Kyle Ash, Greenpeace spokesman, told the Guardian. “The surprise to us was that this resulted in some kind of moral offense. We definitely regret that and we want to figure out a way to resolve it. We are very remorseful for any offense that we’ve caused and we’re very remorseful for that.” He said Greenpeace met on Wednesday with Peru’s minister of culture, Diana Alvarez. He said the organization hoped to maintain a dialogue with the Peruvian government. He added Greenpeace would take “total responsibility” if any permanent damage had been caused to the archaeological site. “It’s not a matter of money. The destruction is irreparable,” Ana Maria Cogorno, President of the Maria Reiche Association named after the German archaeologist whose groundbreaking research on the Nazca Lines from 1940 onwards saw them gain recognition and protection, told the Guardian. The hummingbird etching on which the Greenpeace stunt was laid was the “only one of the lines which was completely untouched and perfectly conserved”, she said. “It’s one of the symbols of Peru,” she added.

The Meaning of Success: Insights from Women at Cambridge was published last year by the university where she used to teach. “Its thesis, that success for a woman is perhaps more broadly based than for a man, is absolutely true,” she says briskly. In other words, when it comes to life-work balance, she thinks women are more bothered than men about life. It is early on Monday morning, and we are drinking tea at the Science Museum in London. In January, Archer became chair of its board of trustees, an appointment made by the prime minister. This is the first interview she has given to a national newspaper since then. She is a formidable presence, immaculately presented in a green suit and jewellery to match her striking eyes on the day we meet, and so encased in her new persona of culture-sector grandee that I can’t help but feel impertinent as I weigh up the questions I plan to ask about her starring role in one of the most famous political scandals of the last century. Today, she is in South Kensington to open an exhibition about Ada Lovelace, whose bicentenary is this year and who, as Archer explains in her speech, may not have been “the first computer programmer”, as some over-enthusiastic feminists have claimed, but was certainly a brilliant pioneer. Not that she wants to be seen as a “single issue” chair: she insists that promoting women in science is “an important strand in the group’s thinking”, not just her own. Still, her tenure here will certainly keep a focus on advancing the cause of clever women such as Lovelace. Martha Lane Fox gave a speech here in March and is back this morning; Zaha Hadid is designing the new maths gallery down the hall. Archer has been extremely successful – both before and after her husband Jeffrey’s 2001 conviction for perjury. In 1987, when she appeared for the plaintiff in the libel case he brought against the Daily Star, her evidence was seen to have swung the case in her husband’s favour – after the judge asked the jury to consider whether the lucky husband of such a wife would bother to seek out “cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex” with a prostitute. She would prefer to be known as the woman who taught chemistry at Oxford and Cambridge universities before becoming chair of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in 2002, while her husband was in prison. Her damehood in 2012 was for services to the NHS. Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare, who retains his title and membership of the House of Lords – although he was blocked by David Cameron from retaking the Conservative whip – claimed his wife was in the frame to take over from David Nicholson as head of the NHS. She got the Science Museum, and its £40m a year of public funds, instead. Though never the show-off Jeffrey always was, Mary Archer is no wallflower. She made a Christmas album a few years ago, and sang on television draped across a piano. If anyone ever doubted it, her promotion to the Science Museum confirms the seriousness with which she treats her post-academic career. Married in her early 20s, she once told another journalist that her family “didn’t do divorce”. Did she never worry that the loyalty she showed her husband would damage her prospects? “No,” she answers crisply, “to me, family does come first, and everything has to work round that, and fortunately it has.” She chuckles. Does she think she has been lucky? “Yes, very lucky, very lucky,” she repeats with smiling emphasis. “Lucky in my education, lucky in my good innate abilities, lucky in the opportunities I’ve been given, lucky in picking up three great jobs – teaching at Cambridge, as chairman of Cambridge University Hospitals and now chairman of the Science Museum Group – at different times in my life, all of which have been wonderfully fulfilling.” She says it again: “I’ve been very lucky.” Jeffrey Archer was a Lincolnshire MP, deputy chair of the Conservative party and possible future mayor of London before his disgrace. Mary has never been a member of a political party, though she is a “Tory sympathiser”, and says it would be strange if she wasn’t. But there are many areas on which she disagrees with her husband, “Europe being one of them – I’m an out, he’s an in,” she says. But she is not afraid to stand up for public services, or for renewable energy – neither of them favourite causes of the Conservative party. She is open-minded about further steps towards healthcare privatisation, but when she was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2010, chose to have surgery on the NHS. “As someone whose life was saved by my own hospital, I would say if you’re really ill I would go to the NHS – I would not go to a private hospital,” she says. Personal experience informs her views on the environment, too. In the 1970s she did academic research on solar energy, having discovered that this was the area of crossover that would enable her – an electrochemist who had worked on batteries and fuel cells – to work for her mentor, Nobel prize winner George Porter, whose London lab was devoted to photochemistry, or the chemical effects of light. “I found there was a field called photoelectrochemistry, invented by the American military in its attempts to build a solar rechargeable battery,” she says. “That was 1972, and I got really lucky because that was the year of the oil-price hikes, and suddenly the OECD woke up to the threat to energy security, and renewable energy got off the ground in all kinds of important ways.” She retains some links with the photovoltaics industry, is planning a new and up-to-date gallery on energy technology, has solar panels on the roof of her holiday house in Mallorca and a ground source heat pump and solar water heating at home in Cambridgeshire (since the Archers’ home is a listed building once lived in by the poet Rupert Brooke, she isn’t allowed photovoltaics on the roof). So is she a green Tory? And what does she think about the government’s current assault on renewables? Displays in the Science Museum ask visitors what they would do to solve our planet’s energy crisis. What would Archer do? “The first thing I’d do would be to try to curtail population growth, because that puts a strain on so many resources as well as energy – food, land, housing. And that appears to be a question of economic development,” she says, sounding like a lecturer. “Onshore wind power to me is clean and green, although some people dislike it. It’s the cheapest form of energy, so these things will take their place.” Her tone is haughty, as if daring me to point out how many millions of miles this places her from the official line of the party she supports. But she agrees that there is “quite a lot of short-term politics” – as opposed to evidence-led policymaking and sound investment – in energy, and says the government should “try to avoid the boom and bust that afflicts the development of renewables. I’m not a hair-shirted environmentalist, I’m not anti-nuclear, I’m not even anti-fossil fuels – but I do believe in the reality of global warming.” She also believes in the reality of cuts, and on this tricky subject for anyone currently working for a big public-sector organisation seeking to protect itself, she takes a position that is a mixture of pragmatism and ruthless self-interest. When I ask if she often meets her colleagues at V&amp;A across the road and the Natural History next door, or if she sees them as rivals, she says firmly: “Oh no, we hang together or we hang on our own”. But this solidarity is not the whole story, as becomes clear when she contrasts Arts Council England’s “selective” approach to cuts with the Department for Culture’s salami-slicing, whereby each institution, so far, has taken the same percentage cut. “We make no bones about special pleading for the importance of supporting the Science Museum Group in a time of public expenditure restraint,” she says. “We are the museum group that fulfils the government’s aim of attracting young people into Stem careers [science, technology, engineering and maths], increasing the science capital of their families.” When the London museum’s most popular gallery, the Launchpad, reopens following renovation, it will no longer be free except to schools, she explains. Archer says it was not until she went to work at Cambridge that she had any direct experience of sexual discrimination. She grew up in Surrey, the daughter of a “very shrewd”, newspaper-reading mother who gave up work after she married and kept any frustration with her lot well hidden, and a father who was a chartered accountant. He practised mental arithmetic with her at home, and she says she owes her numeracy to him, but when the time came to choose subjects, he “gently suggested languages”. She insisted on chemistry – “ever since I knew there was such a subject, I knew I had to do it … I suppose I love putting things in boxes and taking them out” – and went from Cheltenham Ladies’ College to St Anne’s, Oxford, where she realised she was unusual: “I looked around and I thought, ‘there aren’t many women here’, and then I thought, and this is a very female thing to think, ‘I’m never going to keep up with this lot’, and it was one of my larger surprises when I discovered I was well up with that lot!” She laughs almost silently. She says she was “quite spoilt as an undergraduate – that rare thing, a female scientist”, and was lucky in her mentors. Porter in particular was “pretty much pro-women” and helped her enormously. But as a lecturer at Cambridge in the 1960s, she began to notice the kinds of put-downs familiar to so many working women, and when she complained about one of these slights, was told by a senior colleague: “I can’t think why you’re bothering, Mary, my wife’s never had a proper job and it’s never bothered her.” “Things have changed hugely for the better,” she says with evident relief. It’s true, and Archer has done her bit, dutifully visiting schools to encourage girls in science and taking the issues seriously, as have several of her fellow trustees (Dame Athene Donald, a physics professor, was a gender equality champion at Cambridge for four years). Does Archer think there are innate differences that make women less interested in maths and science, and more interested in language and the arts? “Look at Singapore and I think you’d have to argue no,” she says, “but I think there is something fairly deeply ingrained in our culture, and there probably is a real difference in early reading ability – girls are way ahead.” As she tells me how she misses teaching, and how proud she is that one of her former students, Louise Makin, was last year made a dame, a huge noise threatens to drown her out. It is caused by a trolley, explains the press officer, being wheeled across the landing to the museum’s new clockmakers’ gallery, which opens later this month. “Sorry about this,” says Archer. “That’s all right,” I say. “It sounds like elephants.” “The elephant in the room!” she replies with a laugh. The elephant in this room, of course, is Jeffrey Archer’s criminality, and the unswerving loyalty she has always showed him. At the 1987 libel trial – in which he won £500,000 from the Daily Star after convincing a jury he had not paid a prostitute for sex – the judge famously said of Mary Archer in his summing up, “Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance?” Jeffrey Archer served half of a four-year sentence, and since being rebuffed by Cameron in his attempts to return to the fold, he has concentrated on his lucrative career as a bestselling author. More relevant to Mary Archer’s position as chair of a major national institution, in that it bears on her own judgment, is that in 2001 she testified for the defence in the trial in which her husband was found to be a liar who had gone to great lengths to cover up his lies. Before I went to the Science Museum to meet her, I read up on Jeffrey Archer’s two trials, and was reminded about Monica Coghlan, the prostitute persuaded by the News of the World to ask him for money in 1987, so the newspaper could prove he had slept with her and shame him. When he sued for libel, Coghlan was a witness, and repeatedly broke down on the stand. Coghlan, a single parent who had a hard life, was killed in a car crash in 2001, before Jeffrey Archer was jailed for perjury. Does Mary Archer ever think of her, I wonder? It’s a long time ago now, but her husband’s crime wasn’t victimless: Coghlan died having been publicly shamed as a liar. “I would dispute that version of events and I don’t think this interview is about that,” comes the tight-lipped answer. So the jury who found Jeffrey Archer guilty of perjury, and the judges who dismissed his appeal, got it wrong? “Yes, I argued so at the time, and that remains my position absolutely.” The press officer has already called time, so we head downstairs to pose for photographs amid the museum’s recently opened Cosmonauts show, and to marvel at the achievements of Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, and another of life’s winners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2015/may/22/baoding-china-most-polluted-city-air-pollution-beijing-hebei","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T09:24:34Z","webTitle":"Welcome to Baoding, China's most polluted city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/22/baoding-china-most-polluted-city-air-pollution-beijing-hebei","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2015/may/22/baoding-china-most-polluted-city-air-pollution-beijing-hebei","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to Baoding, China's most polluted city","bodyText":"It is a rare blue-skied day in the city of Baoding, in north-eastern China. It’s not even that clear, but the hazy sky is as blue as it gets here. Most days, the sky is obscured by a thick blanket of smog. Baoding, a city of 10 million people, was named in February as China’s most polluted city by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, based on air pollution figures gathered for 2014. By mid-May of this year, the city had only enjoyed 16 days of air quality that could be considered “good” by the official classification. “Generally, there is smog on most days,” says Mr Han, aged 66, who has lived in Baoding his whole life. He drives a motorbike that carries a carriage-like trailer, and parks outside the city’s main supermarket to ferry shoppers home for a small fee. “It was much better when I was young – the air was very clean,” he says. “We rarely see blue skies now.” Expecting coal stacks and factories pumping out toxic fumes, I instead see farmland whizzing past the window as I approach Baoding on the high-speed train from Beijing. Even when driving around the city, it’s not immediately obvious what causes the pollution. The outskirts are home to one coal power plant that doesn’t appear to be in use, with no sign of workers and not a wisp of smoke from the big chimneys. Like an increasing number of plants in the province, it may well have been closed down as part of increased governmental anti-pollution measures. Yet, on a bad day, Baoding’s pollution levels can rise beyond 300 on the air quality index, which is classed as hazardous for human health. On these days, the smog clings to the city like a thick grey shroud, and its residents are ghost-like shadows moving through the haze. Visibility for driving is reduced and headlights and traffic lights glow eerily, barely visible. Air is not something you can normally taste but, on high-pollution days, there is a metallic tang that catches in the back of your throat. Despite this, many of Baoding’s residents appear hesitant to discuss the city’s new status as China’s most polluted city, and when they do, are often defensive of it. “It’s OK in Baoding,” Mr Zhu tells me, pointing to today’s unusually clear skies. He is manning a food stand outside a small restaurant; over a hot stove, he prepares thick savoury pancakes filled with vegetables. Zhu says that his version of this popular snack food is the best in the city – and although he spends hours outside every day, he is not worried about the pollution, asserting his faith that the central government is doing something to improve the situation. According to official figures, on the day I visit Baoding’s air quality is “good” , despite the fact that the level of PM2.5 particles – considered dangerous because they lodge deep in the lungs – is at 54 micrograms per cubic metre, more than double the maximum daily levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. Baoding is located in the north-eastern province of Hebei, China’s pollution “ground zero” which is home to seven of the 10 cities that are ranked worst in the country for air pollution. Surrounding Beijing and with its industries centred in coal and steel, Hebei gets the blame for many of the Chinese capital’s headline-grabbing “airpocalypses”. Pollution has become a controversial topic in China in recent months. In March, a hard-hitting documentary, Under the Dome, outlining the gravity of the country’s air pollution problem – which is estimated to cause the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands of people each year – went viral online. The hour-long film, directed by journalist Chai Jing, has been compared to Al Gore’s 2006 film on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth, and was viewed online more than 200 million times before being censored and removed. Duan Chao, a doctor at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Baoding, confirms that he sees more patients during bouts of smog. “More people come when the air is not good,” he says. “There are more patients with breathing difficulties, people with coughs.” A traditional medicine called ban lan gen is used to treat respiratory illnesses when the smog is bad. Duan says that awareness is rising in Baoding about air pollution. He takes a mask out of his pocket that he carries with him at all times. While a number of people are spotted wearing face masks, they are generally flimsy and loose fitting, or are surgical masks, which offer little or no protection against most pollutants. In main cities like Beijing and Shanghai, specialist face masks are widely on sale and many homes have air purifiers – but in Baoding, none of the people I interviewed had one at home. The great irony here is that, in 2010, Baoding was named as a pilot of China’s new project to introduce low-carbon zones: an ambitious plan to use renewable energies to illuminate streets and heat residential buildings. As a result, the city has become a hub for renewable energy companies, including Yingli Solar, one of the world’s largest photovoltaic manufacturers. Yingli is based in a massive industrial park less than 20 minutes drive from downtown Baoding. The complex seems to go on for miles, with solar panels lining the streets. A new building is under construction with walls made from solar panels; its slogan repeats Yingli’s mission to provide pollution-improving, affordable solar energy for all. At Yingli, Ma Hongha, dressed in blue overalls, heads to start her shift with two of her colleagues. “Many people in Baoding work in this industry,” Ma says, adding that it is important for the city’s economy. She is reluctant to discuss the pollution, but acknowledges it has got worse since she was a child. But, she adds, “Baoding is improving. More solar panels will mean the world will be cleaner.” The industrial area is also home to a number of manufacturers of blades for wind turbines, including Zhong Hang Huiteng Wind Power, one of the largest blade makers in the world. On the edge of the industrial park, turbine blades almost the length of a football pitch are loaded on to flatbed trucks for transportation. In total, around 170 companies related to renewable energy are located in Baoding. Yet still the mystery of the city’s pollution was unclear to me. The city doesn’t have a high concentration of industrial plants around it; there are a lot of cars on the roads and car dealerships are plentiful, but that couldn’t account for the high levels of pollution. Local residents didn’t seem to know, either, or were reluctant to discuss it, though some blamed the weather and pollution from neighbouring cities. It was only when I came across local news reports that the cause of the city’s pollution became clearer. According to preliminary findings of an analysis carried out across Hebei, much of Baoding’s pollution comes from coal-fired steam boiler systems used in more than 100 provincial villages close to the city. These boilers are extremely polluting. Tackling air pollution has become a national priority and, last year, premier Li Keqiang declared “war” on pollution. With its economy still largely reliant on coal-fired industries such as steel and cement, Hebei province is an important battleground in that war – with its authorities faced with the difficult task of balancing economic growth and environmental welfare. Already some parts of Hebei are feeling the impact as plants are closed in an attempt to improve the smog in Beijing. The city’s Communist Party chief, Nie Ruiping, was quoted as saying: “It’s necessary to close some traditional factories to fight air pollution. We cannot sacrifice the environment to make money.” By harnessing the energy of its new industries, perhaps Baoding will not keep its unwanted new title for long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/02/under-the-sun-australias-largest-solar-farm-set-to-sprout-in-a-queensland-field","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-01T23:14:23Z","webTitle":"Under the sun: Australia's largest solar farm set to sprout in a Queensland field","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/02/under-the-sun-australias-largest-solar-farm-set-to-sprout-in-a-queensland-field","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/02/under-the-sun-australias-largest-solar-farm-set-to-sprout-in-a-queensland-field","fields":{"headline":"Under the sun: Australia's largest solar farm set to sprout in a Queensland field","bodyText":"As a barrister acting in some Australia’s biggest defamation cases, Angus Gemmell encountered power in various forms: political, military, celebrity. He killed off rumours bedevilling rising political stars in Canberra. He acted for defence intelligence chief Frank Lewincamp against the Bulletin over stories on Indonesia and the East Timor crisis, in a case where generals Peter Cosgrove and Angus Houston gave evidence. He won the largest damages ever awarded by a judge, $385,000, for rugby league player Mark McGaw over false Today Tonight stories of domestic violence. But after seven years as a barrister, Gemmell decided to leave the intellectual challenges of “other people’s problems” behind, hang up his wig and gown, and devote himself to power in a purer form. Gemmell set up Solar Choice – a solar project broker and consumer comparison service – while still in his legal chambers and he is now the proponent of what stands to become the largest solar farm in the country, perhaps the world. A sea of glass panels, to be located at Bulli Creek on Queensland’s Darling Downs, could be capable of cranking out two gigawatts of power within eight years. That is equivalent to one fifth of the current total renewable energy target for the entire country in a single power station. It is also more power than any coal fired station in Queensland can currently muster. “Excellent sunlight hours” are just one reason why Bulli Creek is ideal for a large-scale solar farm, Gemmell says. It is also grazing land – meaning no prime cropping land need be sacrificed – and is flat, treeless and has no neighbours. Crucially, Bulli Creek is close to a major transmission node in the national electricity grid, a 330 kilovolt substation, perfectly located to send power around the country. “There’s a surprisingly small number of sites (in Australia) that have everything all aligning at once,” Gemmell says. Factors seem to be likewise aligning in solar power’s favour more broadly, although a few things still need to fall into place for the likes of Gemmell. Investment banks are leaning away from coal fired stations towards large scale renewables, he says, while the electric car market is driving rapid innovations in battery storage that are an automatic fillip to the solar energy industry. Those advances are essential in helping the solar industry “nullify the argument principally raised against renewables as being intermittent, and deliver smooth power throughout the day and night,” Gemmell says. Battery storage is what Bulli Creek will also need to reach full capacity and most effectively integrate with the nearby substation. A report this week by a German think tank Agora Energiewende predicted solar would be the cheapest form of energy in a decade. Gemmell, citing deals for 260MW projects in Dubai and power purchase agreements at US 5.84c a kilowatt hour, agrees. “It’s now foreseeable that solar will in the next decade be able to outcompete a very old, fully depreciated coal-fired generator that chugs along at 3 or 4 cents a kWh.” “Obviously once a project’s been constructed, the cost of fuel is free, it’s sunlight, and Australia is wonderfully geared to some visionary projects to harness those benefits of cheaper, bountiful, reliable sources of power,” Gemmell says. “We’ve got abundant space, modern infrastructure across the longest continuous grid on the planet, from Cape York to Tassie, and amongst all that space is plenty of sunshine.” Big energy players like AGL, who are still buying coal-fired power stations, are nevertheless also moving into solar farms and other renewables, which Gemmell says will inevitably quicken. “I think eventually they’ll realise you can’t hold back the forces of economics forever and, even though we’re perhaps more so than any other country on the planet heavily wedded to coal, the economics of large scale solar is on the right side of history,” he says. “It’s not a matter of if these projects will be built but when.” In large-scale solar’s infancy, however, market signals from government matter, even more so in their absence. Investors have reviewed the Bulli Creek project but Gemmell says the commitment to bring in “the big funds” still awaits clarity from the Abbott government on the status of Australia’s renewable energy target (RET), which has been under review for a year. The RET is also a key driver of what kind of power purchase agreement Bulli Creek can secure from a big Queensland electricity retailer like Energex or Origin. “Hopefully we won’t be the first country in the world to diminish our renewable energy target. Most countries are increasing theirs,” Gemmell says. “We would prefer as an industry no deal rather than a bad deal. “But if there’s a reasonable compromise at least we know where the goalposts are to kick the ball. At the moment we’ve got the ball ready on the mark to kick it, we’ve just been waiting for some time now to know where the goal posts are going to be.” In the meantime, Solar Choice will spend the next six to nine months working with the wholesale network owner Powerlink on the right way to connect the solar farm to the grid. After that, the contract with the energy retailer is the final milestone before construction, due to begin next year. The solar farm gained formal planning approval from Toowoomba regional council last month in what Gemmell said was “a wonderful tangible milestone for the project”. Asked if the urgency of responding to climate change meant that, as one commentator has suggested, someone has to get rich, Gemmell responds: “No one’s suggesting that we need to take a communist approach to this.” “It’s a free market and those who are able to be the first to innovate and embrace the change and to move with it should do well and they shouldn’t be punished for doing so,” he says. “Obviously there’s a great amount of opportunity out there but it does take a fair bit of boldness as well to be able to participate in this paradigm shift.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/03/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-03T15:17:01Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: water in Iraq, emperor penguins and Lego","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/03/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/03/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: water in Iraq, emperor penguins and Lego","bodyText":"News • Water supply key to outcome of conflicts in Iraq and Syria, experts warn • Leaked documents cast doubt on Ecuador's commitment to forest plan • Caribbean coral reefs 'will be lost within 20 years' without protection • UK councils could be required to recycle 70% of waste by 2030 • Tuberculosis threat requires mass cull of cattle, not badgers, study reveals • Greenpeace urges Lego to end Shell partnership • Scotland shale gas and oil reserves 'modest' compared with England • Emperor penguins at risk of extinction, scientists warn • First wild beavers to be seen in England for centuries to be captured Blogs • What's the best way to tackle bovine TB? • Can the UK meet a 70% recycling target? • Blast fishing in Borneo: 'bombs are quick, but they kill the coral reefs' | Johnny Langenheim • What the 70s can tell us about culling badgers • There are good reasons to be an apocaloptimist • Global warming makes drought come on earlier, faster, and harder • Peru now has a 'licence to kill' environmental protestors Multimedia • The week in wildlife – in pictures • Arsenic poisoning in rural China - in pictures • Unique underwater world discovered in Pitcairn Islands • Giant 20kg jellyfish spotted in an estuary in Cornwall - video Features and comment • The human cost of China's untold soil pollution problem • Nasa to launch CO2-tracking satellite • Windfarms and solar energy: healthy returns for investors, but risks • Do farmers really need bee-harming insecticides? ...And finally • Kangaroo tail a 'third leg' that gives speed, not just balance, says study Scientists have discovered a kangaroo's tail propels it forward with as much force as its front and hind legs combined"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2012/aug/07/winning-new-business-green-planet-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-07T17:13:12Z","webTitle":"Winning new business: Green Planet Solar Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/aug/07/winning-new-business-green-planet-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2012/aug/07/winning-new-business-green-planet-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Winning new business: Green Planet Solar Energy","bodyText":"Name: Green Planet Solar Energy City: Nuneaton Website: www.greenplanetsolarenergy.co.uk Already well established in the domestic solar photovoltaic sector, Green Planet Solar Energy recognised the urgent need to enhance its commercial portfolio if it were to fully take advantage of the rapid growth predicted for the commercial PV sector in 2012. Having recently completed a commercial scale installation at a Warwickshire golf club, it decided to focus its marketing strategy at this particular sector having identified that golf clubs are ideal candidates for solar PV owing to their secluded nature, ample amount of redundant roof space and their operation during daylight hours. Green Planet launched a marketing campaign targeted specifically at golf clubs. They created a brochure specific to the sector, used existing installs as case studies, placed ads and editorial in the Golf Club Management magazine and made visits and calls and part of a rigorous and ultimately successful campaign, which also included a deal to sponsor European Tour golfer Mark Foster. A number of installs followed, including a 10kWp system at one golf club and a 30kWp (152 panel) installation at another in Lancashire among others, and negotiations with a number of golf clubs across the UK continue. This targeted strategy has quickly established for Green Planet Solar Energy a reputation as specialists in this sector, and as a result they have now successfully applied this strategy to other commercial sectors such as farms and care homes with a number of successful installs already in place.

And there's some good news: the world can afford to transition to clean energy and climate change can be averted without sacrificing our living standards. Here are the key points from the report: • The cheapest and best way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to abandon fossil fuels over the next 10 years. Clean energy would have to treble in output by 2050. • Fracking could be an important intermediary measure as the energy mix moves to become cleaner, but only if coal is abandoned. • Fears that cutting carbon would destroy the economy were dismissed. The report calculated that moving from fossil fuels to renewables would reduce expected annual economic growth rates by 0.06%. We've collected reactions from thought leaders and experts here. Professor Jim Skea, an energy expert at Imperial College London and co-chair of the IPCC report team, told the Guardian It is actually affordable to do it and people are not going to have to sacrifice their aspirations about improved standards of living. It is not a hair shirt change of lifestyle at all that is being envisaged and there is space for poorer countries to develop too. The World Resources Institute's Kelly Levin and C Forbes Tompkins The [IPCC] report provides sobering insight as to how urgent and substantial the challenge of reducing our emissions will be to best ensure we can limit warming to 2°C. While those challenges may initially appear daunting, it’s important to focus on the menu of solutions the report outlines. Furthermore, the report finds that there are significant “co-benefits” of reducing emissions, which make mitigation action even more imperative. For example, the report shows that low-emissions pathways not only reduce countries’ vulnerability to energy price volatility and supply disruptions, they produce significant benefits for human health and ecosystems by curbing air pollution. We may be on the wrong emissions pathway now, but with ambitious action, there is still a chance to move onto the right one. Now is the time for governments at all levels to adopt comprehensive climate policies and invest in a low-carbon future — so that we don’t end up paying the price later. Oxfam America Al Gore Li Shuo, climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia China could break the deadlock in UN climate talks by presenting an ambitious new target with binding emissions cuts. If China leads, the US and the EU will have no excuse for not being more progressive. The test of whether governments are willing to act on the IPCC’s findings or turn their backs on public concern will come during next year’s climate treaty talks in Paris. 350.org European divestment coordinator Tim Ratcliffe Investors now have scientific evidence that if you put your money into fossil fuels you are complicit in wrecking our future. We know that 80% of fossil fuels need to stay underground in order to avoid a climate catastrophe. The fossil fuel industry however is spending billions every year to find yet new reserves, spread misinformation about climate change, corrupt political progress and block clean energy solutions ... We have the solutions to make the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. But we need to stop pumping money into a rogue industry that is determined to maximise its profits at any cost. We need to invest in clean energy solutions now. Dr Celine Herweijer, partner on sustainability and climate change at PWC If the Working Group 2 report on impacts describes a potential train wreck and Working Group 1 identifies the driver, the Working Group 3 report on mitigation explains how to avoid the crash. But it also suggests that the brakes are not working.

As we move forward, we must not pursue environmental sustainability at the expense of poor people's food security and nutrition; the agenda must be people-focused. We must adopt a win-win strategy that promotes synergies and manages trade-offs between environmental sustainability, food security and improved nutrition, but this will require concerted efforts. During the past 20 years, high-profile, environmentally focused events, such as the Rio Earth Summit and its successor the Rio+20 Conference, have generally failed to give adequate attention to food security and nutrition issues within the sustainable development framework. Continuing a silo-based approach to sustainable development will undermine the food security and nutrition of poor people and vulnerable groups. For example, efforts to curb deforestation and (re)plant forests have the potential to minimise land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, many developing countries are already facing a limited supply of land suitable for agricultural production. As a result, the conversion of agricultural land to forests comes with potentially high costs to the rural poor and marginalised people, at least in the short run, including increased risk of displacement and the loss of a significant source of food and income opportunities. Eliminating agricultural subsidies in many developed and developing countries can help to reduce the overuse of water and fertiliser and cut down carbon emissions. However, the removal of such subsidies and the incorporation of the environmental costs of agricultural production will cause food prices to increase. This will have negative implications for poor smallholder farmers who are net buyers of food and consumers who already spend a large portion of their income on food. Rising energy prices in recent years and growing environmental concerns regarding traditional energy sources have resulted in increased demand for biofuels as a source of low-carbon energy (underpinned by government mandates and subsidies). In the coming decade, biofuel production is projected to increase by almost 70%. The expansion of crop-based biofuels has encouraged competition between food and biofuel production as agricultural resources increasingly shift toward crops that serve as biofuel feedstock, contributing to the recent increase in food prices. Many of these trade-offs between environmental sustainability, food security and nutrition are avoidable. Cross-sectoral benefits must be explored that promote win-win solutions for all. Increased investment in agricultural research and development should focus on advancing technologies that not only increase yields but save natural resources, emit less carbon, increase food security and improve nutrition. A step in this direction is the ongoing research by the International Rice Research Institute to develop a new rice variety (C4) that can more efficiently convert solar energy through photosynthesis, thereby improving yields and saving scarce resources such as land and water. Biotechnology and biofortification, which add micronutrients to food crops through breeding, can also increase micronutrient intake while decreasing the use of (potentially harmful) inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers. Research should also focus on next-generation biofuels that do not compete with food crops. High-quality and effective delivery and extension channels are needed to strengthen access to these technologies in developing countries, especially among smallholder farmers. A strong social protection system can assist and compensate poor consumers and producers once the full costs of agricultural production are internalised. Better-targeted, more productive and flexible social protection policies are needed to 1) minimise the possible negative impacts of reducing inefficient subsidies in the short term and 2) offer long-term opportunities for the poor to escape poverty and food insecurity. Good data and metrics are critical to assess the food security and nutrition implications of natural resource policies, and in turn the natural resource implications of food security and nutrition policies. Fundamentally, we have to move toward metrics that measure the performance of food production and environmental systems in a holistic manner, using indicators such as nutrients per drop of water, hectare of land or kilowatt of energy. The post-2015 development agenda must work to achieve the goals of environmental sustainability, food security and improved nutrition. A people-focused approach will require concerted action to maximise synergies and minimise trade-offs, but ultimately, it can lead to wins for all – especially poor people and vulnerable groups. We can no longer afford to work in silos if we want to achieve truly sustainable development. Shenggen Fan is director general at the International Food Policy Research Institute.

Propane, which makes up the bulk component of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), has previously only ever been produced from fossil fuels. But a team of scientists at Imperial College in London has successfully demonstrated that they can make propane from glucose using a genetically engineered version of bacterium E coli. “We can now make a product that until now was only available from fossil fuels and it’s chemically identical,” Patrik Jones, the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday, told the Guardian. “It should work exactly the same as normal propane.” Around 160,000 cars run on LPG in the UK, some of which have been converted from petrol or diesel engines by owners looking to save money at the pump. LPG has environmental benefits too, with greenhouse gas emissions up to 20% lower than unleaded petrol. Jones said he would eventually like to produce propane using solar energy. The new work only produced tiny quantities of propane, but is a proof of concept that it could be produced without the need for its two usual sources of production – petrol refining and natural gas processing. “It’s not something that’s going to be used by industry today, but it is important and significant,” said Jones, who added he would need to scale up the production by three magnitudes to attract investors. To make the propane, the team “hijacked the assembly line” of the biological process of fatty acid synthesis in E coli, introducing a group of enzymes (Thioesterase) into the bacterium. Two more enyzmes were then added to eventually turn the smelly fatty acid into propane. Producing petrol or diesel = would be much more complex, Jones said. The team chose propane over other fuels on the grounds that it could be liquified, making it easier to transport, and done so with 30 times as less energy than it takes to liquify hydrogen, which has been proposed as another ‘green’ fuel source. Jones said: “Fossil fuels are a finite resource and as our population continues to grow we are going to have to come up with new ways to meet increasing energy demands. It is a substantial challenge, however, to develop a renewable process that is low-cost and economically sustainable. “At the moment algae can be used to make biodiesel, but it is not commercially viable as harvesting and processing requires a lot of energy and money. So we chose propane because it can be separated from the natural process with minimal energy and it will be compatible with the existing infrastructure for easy use.” • This article was amended on 13 October 2014.

Since 2010, Buffalo Grid has been working to bring cheap electricity to rural communities in Uganda, where 80% of the population owns mobile phones but only 5% has access to power. At present, many people travel to the nearest town twice a week to charge their phones; the journey can take up to half a day and has a considerable cost. After a prototype of bicycle-powered generators failed, Daniel Becerra, Buffalo Grid's managing director and co-founder, came up with a new device: a portable, quick \"mini power station\" that charges up to 24 phones at a time using solar energy. Charging takes the same time as a wall socket. Becerra's background is in industrial design and engineering. After studying in Mexico and running his own design consultancy, he attended Imperial College, where he was part of a team that developed a substitute for air-conditioning that gave 90% of the efficiency with 5% of the consumption. Buffalo Grid, named after buffalo charges, has so far set up five machines in Uganda, given free to local entrepreneurs who guard the phones while they charge. The machines have been distributed to an existing network of coffee farmers, who have worked for decades with Becerra's co-founder, Phil Schluter, a coffee trader. Becerra says the project's main innovation lies in its distribution model: people pay by sending a text message (roughly 10p, the market rate) and then plug their phones into the nearest grid. \"This allows you to claim your revenues remotely, and have a much lower running cost that allows you to offer an affordable service.\" Mobile phones are vital for people in developing countries, whether for trading, safety or general communication. The UN, where Becerra presented the project earlier this year, identifies the mobile phone as the biggest contributor to economic growth in off-grid areas. \"Mobile phones are really changing the game: they improve quality of life and business activities. If you need a doctor or you've been robbed, you need a phone,\" Becerra says. \"You hear stories of users who would sacrifice their quality of food just to get airtime and a charge for their phones.\" Mobile phone charging is the machine's main use at the moment, but it can also be used for rechargeable lights. Buffalo Grid is about to launch a pilot in India and the ultimate goal is reaching the 1.2 billion people in the world who live without electricity. Becerra's favourite part of the project has been discovering Uganda: \"I'd never been to sub-Saharan Africa before. I was quite apprehensive – in the news you only hear bad things – but once you go you realise how magical it is. People live very pleasant lives and the environment is incredibly beautiful.

Midweek diners wolf down parmigianas and chips as an array of poker machines wink in the background. An NRL tipping competition at the bar is doing brisk business. The beer is decidedly non-craft. But this no-nonsense venue, just 10km but a world away from parliament, is the latest stop in a national pro-renewables tour that is making the Abbott government decidedly uncomfortable. Organised by the Solar Council, an industry body for the solar energy sector, the Save Solar Forum is targeting the 20 most marginal Coalition electorates in Australia. Its message, delivered via speeches to gatherings that are open to the public, is simple – retain the renewable energy target. The RET, which stipulates that 41,000GW hours – currently about 26% – of Australia’s energy should come from renewable sources by 2020, appears to be under its greatest threat since being introduced by John Howard’s government. A government-commissioned report by businessman Dick Warburton, who has expressed doubts over whether humans are influencing climate change, concedes that the RET has largely done its job. By requiring energy providers to buy renewable energy certificates it has helped expand wind, solar and other renewables, driving investment and jobs, all at a negligible cost to the taxpayer. But this success is a problem, Warburton contends, and so the RET must be wound back or scrapped. Abbott is understood to favour the latter. The clean energy sector argues this would be disastrous for the industry, imperilling about 20,000 jobs and billions of dollars of new investment. Work on new large-scale wind and solar projects has largely ground to a halt. In Queanbeyan, the solar preacher in the pulpit is John Grimes, chief executive of the Solar Council. Grimes is fresh from a bruising encounter from Greg Hunt, the environment minister who once skydived in support of solar energy subsidies, following the last solar forum in Brisbane. “There are people in this audience who will lose their jobs if this goes through and we will not just stand by and allow that to happen,” Grimes says, to whoops and applause. There is an air of confidence, the feeling that the government is rattled on this. It’s a decent turnout – about 400 people – with few spare seats. Grimes runs through a rather unflattering appraisal of the government’s record on renewables. A reminder that the treasurer, Joe Hockey, finds wind turbines “offensive” provokes derisive laughter and a few boos. Queanbeyan sits in the bellwether NSW seat of Eden-Monaro, which the Coalition holds with one of its slimmest majorities. Former Howard aide Peter Hendy won the seat in 2013 with a margin of just 1,085 votes from moustachioed Labor incumbent Mike Kelly. Kelly is lurking ominously in the audience, sensing a group of voters that may have buyer’s regret. Hendy is openly lampooned on stage, with an empty seat bearing his name. Someone in the audience calls Hendy a coward. Hendy refused an invitation from Grimes, calling the forum a “Greens branch meeting.” The leader of the Greens, Christine Milne, who is also on stage, looks bewildered when Grimes mentions this. “It’s vital we fight this campaign now, the Coalition MPs need to understand they need to change their leader’s position,” Grimes says. “This isn’t a partisan issue, but we are resolute. The government needs to know this will hurt them politically. Your local member, Peter Hendy, needs to hear loud and clear that this is just not on. We think changing enough votes on this one issue will be a cinch.” Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, isn’t impressed with Hendy. “It’s pretty weak,” Butler says. “It’s the job of a member of parliament, especially when you’re drawing a salary paid for by taxpayers, to front up to hear every message the community wants to give you, whether it’s a comfortable or uncomfortable one.” Still, given the hostility on display to the government’s position, it’s perhaps understandable that Hendy didn’t show up. The polling isn’t pretty either – recent surveys have shown support for the RET in the region of 70% and higher. Newspoll found 98% of respondents are in favour of renewable energy. “What else do 98% of Australians agree on? Is there anything?” Butler asks rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Hendy tells Guardian Australia the Solar Forum is “partisan” and unhelpfully scheduled on a parliamentary sitting day. “They are simply attacking the government and me,” he says. “The government’s policy is to deal with the issue of climate change and a key part of that is to promote alternative energy sources.” Hendy won’t comment on the Warburton report – the government has yet to officially respond – but says he appreciates that renewables need “some sort of subsidy”. “I acknowledge that there is a place for subsidies,” he says. “Climate change and environmental issues are important issues for people in Eden-Monaro. Part of that is support for renewable energy so we’ll see how that pans out.” Back in Queanbeyan, the audience certainly contains several Greens, but there are other groups. Retirees, men in high-vis vests, a few plumbers. While the stalling of large-scale wind and solar projects worries some, the meat of the opposition to the government is derived from the remarkable take-up in household solar, largely in Coalition electorates. About 1.2m Australian households have solar panels in their roofs. The demise of the RET would be bad news for anyone who would want to follow them in a bid to knock some dollars off their power bills. There are more than 17,000 solar installations in Eden-Monaro (the wind industry has taken a back seat in this campaign, perhaps due to unfounded fears of turbines) and voters who have already invested readily take to the microphone to voice their grumpiness. “I’ve installed a solar system on my house and I appreciate those savings,” says one, Hugh Howell. “Coal is the industry of the past and I don’t understand why this government is so beholden to these industries of the past. The Libs don’t seem to understand the world has changed.” Moira Nelson, who has driven from Canberra, is on a disability pension and can’t afford rooftop panels. But she’d like the opportunity, one day. “I’d really like it but the cost is a problem,” she says. “The newspapers seem to take a very political view on all this. It feels like we are losing our voice.” The question of whether renewable energy, especially household solar, is popular is a fairly easy one to answer in the affirmative. The crucial aspect, politically for the Coalition, is how deep that popularity runs. “People have wanted renewables for a long time,” says Butler afterwards. “My mum had a solar sticker on her car when I was young. But the unknown is how deeply people feel about it. “My feeling is that it has the potential to be emblematic of the fact Tony Abbott doesn’t have his eye on the future and doesn’t have regard for evidence-based policy.” The Solar Forum moves on, with its next stop in the Sydney seat of Barton. Grimes exhorts the audience to keep the faith. “I need you to help us put the pressure on,” he says. “I can’t do the phone calls and write the emails myself. I need you all to send a message, to make them feel nervous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/19/what-is-environmental-cost-of-hot-tub-lucy-siegle","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-19T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"What is the environmental cost of a hot tub? | Lucy Siegle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/19/what-is-environmental-cost-of-hot-tub-lucy-siegle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/19/what-is-environmental-cost-of-hot-tub-lucy-siegle","fields":{"headline":"What is the environmental cost of a hot tub?","bodyText":"Although I’ve been dispensing eco advice for a decade, this is the first time I’ve been asked to green-light a hot tub. I should have known this day was coming, because figures suggest the country is awash with them – there are between 2.6m (according to a Lloyds Insurance survey) and a more likely industry estimate of 300,000 out there. The hot tub appears to have transitioned into a “wellness appliance”. According to the many brochures I’ve perused on your behalf, hot-tubbing (which is now a verb) helps to reduce chronic stress and conditions such as circulatory disorders. I’ve even seen a model that purports to be anti-ageing. But in the marginally less joyful world of energy-efficient analysis, hot tubs are categorised as “portable electric spas” and carry a terrible energy profile. According to the US Consortium for Energy Efficiency, the energy used to operate a small pool or hot tub can account for more than half of a home’s total energy use. As one of the online UK retailers puts it: “Relaxing in your hot tub can prove difficult when the bills it produces are anything but.” It’s worth spelling out what you’re attempting to do here: you want to place a large bath outside in our variable climate and maintain it at a consistent hot temperature, using a pump to make a whirlpool through a series of jets. (Hot tubs lose heat more quickly when the jets are on.) Heating and hot water already account for an estimated 84% of domestic energy consumption and 71% of CO2 emissions in the UK, a situation which must be tackled if we’re to meet 2020 targets. So hot tubs are hard to love from a sustainability point of view, unless you’re skilled enough to go the DIY solar-powered route. To do this, you’d have to integrate a solar water heater and build the tub from reclaimed materials. If this is beyond you, there are “eco” models. These include Hydropool’s Serenity hot tub which cabinsandspas.co.uk reckons is “engineered to be the most efficient in the world”. Eco models are highly insulated and should have a hard, heavy cover (most energy escapes through the cover, so look for the highest insulation value). Also go for one with low-energy LED lights. This isn’t just greenwash: an energy-efficient hot tub uses 7 to 11 fewer kWh per day than its rivals. This would take some of the environmental heat out of your back-garden Jacuzzi. Green crush Would we love large-scale solar farms more if they were heart shaped? It’s an idea that will be tested by a new farm being built on Grand Terre, an island 750 miles east of the Australian Gold Coast, in the French territory of New Caledonia. On Grand Terre, 7,888 panels will generate enough electricity to supply 750 homes. The design is inspired by the Coeur de Voh, the naturally heart-shaped wild mangrove vegetation documented in Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s book The Earth from Above. The Heart of New Caledonia is expected to save 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over its 25-year life span. It will be ‘a landmark for clean power generation and perhaps the first beautiful power station’ in the world, according to solar-energy company Conergy.

Rolling hills dotted with sheep; blue skies with dark clouds sidling in from the west; the air-cutting howls of six or seven huskies … um, hang on. “What’s the matter with them?” I ask Vickie Pullin, who runs the dog sled adventure company Arctic Quest. “They want to run,” she explains. We’re at Croft Farm, the Arctic Quest headquarters – essentially, a van packed with equipment and waterproofs, and the huskies. The “Arctic” part of the company name conjures up images of snowy Siberian plains. Croft Farm, with its green grass and rocky paths, doesn’t quite live up to that. “I grew up in Gloucestershire,” says Vickie, “it’s beautiful, and just on the edge of the Cotswolds so people can get to us easily.” Which is certainly a point scored over Siberia. Dog-sledding in the UK is, inevitably, somewhat different to sledding in the snow. “The UK isn’t the huskies’ natural habitat,” admits Chantelle Godard-Jones, a race coach. “Huskies were bred for Siberian temperatures, so dog sledding is really a winter sport.” Summer rides with Arctic Quest have to start at 6am to protect the dogs from heat exhaustion. Amid the howls, Vickie shows me the “cart” or “rig”, a rickety-looking three-wheeled contraption I’ll be standing on when the dogs take me for a ride. I mean, when I run the dogs. It’s similar to a bicycle frame, except there are footholds instead of a seat, and if we were in the snow it would have ski-like planks rather than wheels. From here, I’ll be hooked up to the dogs, who will determine what speed I go at (“you’re only as fast as the slowest dog”). But it’s safe, right? “It’s safe if you use the training I give you,” says Vickie. “If you slam on the brake or lean too far to one side and topple, yes, you can fall off and break a leg. Not just yours – the dogs’ as well.” I grimace. “Don’t worry. It hasn’t happened yet.” Vickie lived in Canada for three years, hoping to be a professional snowboarder, but became interested in dog-sledding instead. Back in England, she carried on dog-sledding with her own huskies, and friends would say, “I’d pay to have a go at that,”, so she set up her business. Obsessed with the sport, she’s just returned from the European Championships, where she came first in Team GB, and has qualified for the Canada 2015 World Championships. Arctic Quest is still the only UK dog-sledding company that teaches you how to run the dogs, which doesn’t surprise me; it does feel like a one-off experience – if you were out walking in Gloucestershire or anywhere else in the UK, you wouldn’t expect to be overtaken by a pack of huskies – much less with an amateur at the rig. Or shouting “Haw!”, for that matter. I practise scooting around dogless on the rig, pushing myself along with one foot, like a scooter. Then it’s time to try the real thing. As Vickie attaches McKinley (her first husky and an easygoing, older dog), she gives the obligatory safety talk. “We start everybody off slowly with one dog, and build up according to how comfortable you are.” I give the command, “Let’s go!”, and push off with my foot. McKinley’s as easygoing as promised – I have to give a few pushes with my leg to encourage him to get going. I almost forget to shout, “Haw!” which means left, and “Gee!”, right. The second ride is with McKinley and Tamsin, a rehomed husky. I shout encouragement: “Good boy! Good girl!”, but we still go slowly enough that I feel bad for them, having to pull my winter weight over this bumpy terrain. The rig rattles and shakes; I’m convinced I’m about to go flying off and crunch face-first on to the gravel. I squeeze the brake in terror and the dogs whine in frustration. I take a deep breath, and let it go. The dogs pick up speed, the panic subsides and I realise, to my surprise, that this is absolutely exhilarating. I lean into the turns, suddenly totally in control – we’re probably only going 20mph at most, but the wind whips through my hair as if I’m on a motorbike. Damn, I’m good at this, I think. Maybe I’ll join Vickie in the championships. For more details, go to arcticquest.co.uk. Husky rides start at £30 per person in groups of eight or more More winter adventures 01. Ice touring The Elfstedentocht, – the Eleven Cities Tour – is an epic 125-mile ice-skating adventure along canals that run through 11 cities in the Netherlands. The tour is only held when the ice along the entire course is at least 15cm thick, and the wait between events can stretch from one to 20 years. When the ice is thick enough, the tour is announced, and starts within 48 hours – so be prepared to fly to Holland at very short notice. 02. Walking with wolves Hike through the Cumbrian woods with wolf hyrbids Maska and Kajika – as close as you can get to real wolves off the lead. You’ll watch them prowling the forest, and learn how to howl to regroup the pack. Or head up into the Lakeland fells to fly a golden eagle with a six foot two wingspan, which will swoop to your glove vertically at 80mph. In winter, it’s bitterly cold, so wrap up warm.

With the existing moratorium on fracking and the demise of the deep coalmining industry, this means that Wales has the possibility of opening a new chapter in its history. It means that Wales could become the first country in the world with substantial fossil fuel reserves to put them beyond use. It’s a moment of global and intergenerational significance, because Wales was the source of much of the coal that fuelled the industrial revolution. Fossil fuels have huge political and psychological significance in Wales. At a time when the world is crying out for leadership, this is something within the gift of assembly members. In decades and centuries to come, when their children and grandchildren, and their grandchildren, are living in a world changed by climate change, they will owe these legislators a debt of gratitude. Their stance will mean that the world they inherit is so much better than it might have been.

Little wonder, because on 19 June 2009 you recorded that both countries had two centuries of coal reserves. So, no surprise that on 31 October 2014 you described India’s “dash for coal”, with new prime minister Narendra Modi promising electricity to 400 million within five years. Yet last week, from the comfort of the US, Al Gore called providing the poor with coal-generated electricity “cynical” (Stand up to the fossil fuel fightback – cheap coal is a lie, 17 April). It looks positively different in India. Which is why on 29 October 2012 you observed a “resurgence”, a “renaissance”, a “bonanza”, in coal, with consumption up 8.4% in developing countries. That will continue, not just through new power plants, but because, as you reported on 28 July 2014, “the largest coalmine in Australia” is being developed to export coal to India for the next 60 years. Now the Guardian calls on the world to “keep it in the ground”. That may seem sensible in the west. But China and India, both striving to develop their economies rapidly, aren’t going to forgo such a cheap and accessible energy resource. Similarly, the Guardian supports divestment of energy company shares. That might work on the west’s stock exchanges, but in Asia they run their economies differently. It is time for the Guardian to take off its western blinkers and see fossil fuels as others see them. It will not be pleasant. Coal is driving the world to a climate catastrophe. But it is no use the Guardian preaching renunciation. You would do a better service to humankind by advising the world how to prepare for and adapt to the extreme changes that are certain to hit soon. Jack Winkler Emeritus professor of nutrition policy, London Metropolitan University • While Felix Salmon (Keep it in the ground: Why this is a matter of basic ethics, 13 April) concludes that your campaign remains valid despite concerns about its “idealism”, he struggles to make the investment case for divestment. For many of the investors we represent, the moral case would be justification enough. However, is the investment argument really so strongly stacked against divestment? As managers specialising in ethical and sustainable investment, we have been directly engaged in the issues around fossil fuel investment for almost two decades. With over £700m in funds under management – a significant proportion of which is invested for charitable trusts – we have seen a gradual convergence of the moral and investment arguments in favour of divestment. Salmon notes that fossil fuel investment has not provided attractive returns relative to the market over a variety of periods and highlights this as evidence that the sector is not necessarily a home for “avaricious” investors. While not all investors are necessarily avaricious, many invested because they expected more positive financial returns than have been realised. But is it fair to say that renewables cannot provide the same level of financial returns as the oil and gas sector during “normal” periods of oil price performance? Although at a much earlier stage in its development, there are growing opportunities in renewables to benefit from the positive returns now being achieved not only by manufacturers of renewable energy equipment but also renewable energy generators. Such returns include rising levels of income. The arguments in favour of divestment should consider risk and reward as well as moral judgments. The risks of not being invested are clear: if the oil and gas sector performs well, portfolios without exposure may suffer. However, as noted, positive returns are not guaranteed at a sector level. At a company level, too, expansion into more extreme areas of production is not without risk – as was amply illustrated by BP’s Gulf of Mexico disaster. Should drilling in the Arctic be considered less risky than generating power from wind or solar energy? For investors such as charitable foundations with very long-term time horizons, being late could be just as inexcusable as being early. So perhaps for some investors this is an example of when doing the right thing morally is also the right thing financially. John David Head of Rathbone Greenbank Investments • Your article (World Bank ‘increased finance for fossil fuels’, 18 April) was misleading. Here are the facts. World Bank Group fossil fuel financing fell from $2.2bn in 2013 to $1.3bn in 2014 – around a third of which went to relatively low-carbon natural gas projects. There has been zero World Bank Group financing for greenfield coal power for the past four years and that trend is likely to continue. Our financing for renewable energy projects (which includes solar, wind, large- and small-scale hydro, geothermal, and biomass) more than doubled from $1.6bn to $3.59bn from 2013 to 2014. Two-thirds of this energy financing was used to provide affordable and sustainable energy for some of the world’s poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia – home to most of the 1.2 billion people without access to energy. The Oil Change International (OCI) report upon which your article was based, apparently without question, uses a flawed methodology for classifying energy projects that is neither recognised by industry nor by the World Bank Group. OCI categorises as fossil fuel financing all hydropower projects, whether small or large, as well as all electricity grid and transmission projects. Our support for grid upgrading and transmission projects is designed to improve the efficiency of developing country power systems and help deliver a range of sources of energy – including renewables. These projects, for example, help expand access to energy to the two out of three Africans who currently have no electricity.

The gist is that large corporations love oil and gas because they can own and control it. They’re against renewable energy because no-one can own the sun or wind. The problem for anti-corporate green-energy campaigners is, increasingly: the meme isn’t true. As the materials for producing wind and solar energy become cheaper, tax breaks and incentives for renewable energy increase, and the prospect of finding more oil and gas becomes weaker, corporations are entering the green energy landscape to the tune of billions of dollars. Last month, NRG, one of the US’s largest energy companies with 100 power plants across the country, including plants that run on coal and natural gas, finalized details in its bid to buy Alta Wind Energy Center in California, the largest wind farm in North America, for $800m. It was the latest blockbuster renewable energy deal by a large corporation in recent years. There’s the under-construction 560 megawatt Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in California, which is owned jointly by NextEra Energy – an energy conglomerate that makes about $15bn a year mostly from gas and nuclear plants, GE, and Sumitomo – a Japanese company that gets most of its billions from mining, oil and gas production. And there’s the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm, owned by MidAmerican, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s multi-billion dollar empire which is also heavily invested in coal and oil. Even Google, Microsoft and Apple are getting into the game. All three companies announced plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into wind and solar this year. Green energy: going the same way as organic food? “There’s a battle going on – and it’s not a very public battle – over who owns green energy and who benefits from it,” said Anya Schoolman, the executive director of the Community Power Network, a non-profit which helps fund and build local power networks. To some, the investment is a double-edged sword. Environmentalists fear that green energy may now be going the same way as organic food – becoming an industry that uses the language and imagery of a social movement to sell products that benefit multi-billion dollar corporations, and not necessarily the communities they serve. “People used to think renewables wouldn’t only bring energy into the 21st century, but would also bring the economy and democracy into the 21st century,” said Anthony Giancatarino, a program manager for energy projects at the Center for Social Inclusion, a nonprofit that lobbies against inequality, among other things. “I don’t think the industry has been totally co-opted yet, but we’re seeing seeds of that happening.” Companies invested $214bn in green energy globally last year, according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the United Nations Environment Program. That’s 14% less than was invested in 2012, but analysts believe that has more to do with falling costs of renewable energy generation than with a lack of interest in the industry. Tellingly, clean energy share prices were up 54% last year, and while investments in small, private energy firms tumbled by 46%, public renewable energy companies (ie big companies), saw their equity double to $11bn in just one year. That shows investors are more sure of seeing profitable returns from large-scale energy investment than from small start-up energy projects, according to the report. The benefits and drawbacks of such behemoths entering an arena once dominated by small companies and nonprofits are still being evaluated. ‘Corporate support is a welcome change’ For some, the dream of green energy was not as much about lowering CO2 as it was giving communities a voice in their energy needs. In low-income, predominantly minority areas that are often most affected by the inherent issues that come with living next to a fossil fuel plant, wind and solar was seen as an alternative to the pollution-causing energy solutions of large corporations. In Richmond, California, for example, residents and activists are petitioning the city to buy power from solar energy sources, and are installing panels on low-income homeowners’ rooftops. The point for campaigners there is not only to increase green energy use, but to decrease the city’s economic reliance on a notorious Chevron oil refinery that caught fire in 2012, sending 15,000 people to the hospital for respiratory problems. But the refinery is still going strong, and Chevron has invested millions in renewable energy in California. “If the city decides to install more solar, there’s nothing stopping Chevron from being the one to do it,” said Giancatarino. Beyond the irony of the same companies that environmental activists have fought against profiting from renewables, there are more direct impacts from big companies entering the green energy market. Some say large companies have an advantage when it comes to getting through complex permitting processes and winning grants and state incentives which often require filling out mountains of paperwork. “These large companies are coming in and competing for the same state and local incentives that we are,” Schoolman said. “You’ll see it all the time. Often there’s no more money for projects because a few plants came in and sucked up all the incentives.” And in some cases, big energy companies are actively trying to quash the kind of community-based energy production that many green activists favor. Arizona’s largest electric company APS is investing heavily in renewable energy, but it’s also lobbying heavily to make installing solar panels on rooftops less affordable. But for some green energy advocates, corporate support of green energy is a welcome change. “Given our economic system we need to figure out a way for companies to make money on things like renewable energy, so they actually do it,” said Cara Pike, the executive director of green energy think tank Climate Access. Pike points to Walmart’s recent launch of an organic food line as proof that large corporations and community-focused solutions to environmental problems can coexist, and perhaps even help open up a once-small movement to people who would otherwise remain uninvolved. “Just because big companies went organic doesn’t mean that there aren’t farmers markets,” she said. “We need everyone getting into renewable energy right now, including the mainstream companies making it more accessible to the people who were never going to be part of the movement in the first place.” • This article was amended on 8 August to redraft a sentence to more accurately reflect Chevron’s investments in renewables in California"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/perovskites-future-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-07T14:30:00Z","webTitle":"Perovskites: the future of solar power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/perovskites-future-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/perovskites-future-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Perovskites: the future of solar power?","bodyText":"The daily input of solar energy to the earth's surface is enough to fulfil our energy needs many times over, but cheap and efficient ways of converting it, especially to electricity, have remained elusive. Yes, there is a lot of photovoltaic material installed around the world today – more than 100 gigawatts – but the efficiency of conversion to kilowatt hours is relatively poor, usually 15% or less. More than 85% of the photovoltaics (PV) used today are made from crystalline silicon, but scientific research continues into new materials that could do the job better. The criteria are greater efficiency, with cheap materials that are readily available, solid, durable under prolonged exposure to sunlight and weather, and, if possible, fairly transparent. There have been many false dawns. A number of these have scored high on efficiency, but have used materials so exotic that any scale-up would be limited by availability and cost. Now there is excitement, and it is over a class of materials known as perovskites. Perovskite is the term for a particular mineral crystal structure, most commonly a calcium titanium trioxide mineral, and is applied to anything that adopts this same structure. Perovskite materials for solar cells were first reported in 2009 (organolead halides, in case you are interested), but they were very low efficiency and had to remain liquid in use. Not promising. But it caught the attention of several research groups, in particular that of Henry Snaith at Oxford, and Andrew Rappe at the University of Pennsylvania. By doing some clever polymer chemistry, they were able to make solid perovskite solar cells, and then, in only 18 months, engineered these up to efficiencies of 16%. It took decades of research on silicon to get such improvements. But the polymer was expensive and complex. Still, Science magazine classed perovskite solar cells as one of the breakthroughs of 2013. The great solar cell scientist and inventor Michael Graetzel in Lausanne was intrigued, and figured out just how these cells were transporting the electrons, and how that polymer worked. With that information, it has recently been possible for scientists at Notre Dame University in the US to discover that the complex polymer could be replaced by something as simple as copper iodide. OK, their first cell is not yet up to the 16% efficiency, but there was a benefit: while the polymer based cells declined in current over time, the copper iodide ones did not. So perovskite PV is at the point of, perhaps, maximum optimism. There are predictions that the efficiencies could reach 50%, the costs could fall to well below where silicon might get to in 10 years, and the science points to it being desirable to make these cells thicker, rather than as thin films, meaning they can be suitable as window or roofing materials. And the prototype cells produced have partial transparency. There are already companies working on commercialising perovskite. Snaith has formed Oxford PV, and has already attracted £2m of start-up funding. Perovskites are the clean tech material development most worth watching right now.

Work on the project began in the first week of January. The initial cost - which is being funded by the Chinese government as a friendship gesture – is estimated at $60m (£36.5). The solar plant is projected to save almost $1m each year in utility bills for the parliament complex. “This is the first project of its kind (in a public building) in Pakistan, and later more public buildings will be converted to solar power to overcome the energy crisis,” said Munawar Abbas Shah, a special secretary at the National Assembly. Beijing has formally approved the funding for the parliamentary solar plant, so “Pakistan is not going to spend even a single penny,” Shah added. Although Pakistan has no plans to introduce solar power on a large scale, China recently helped Punjab province set up a solar park of over 10,000 acres (around 4,000 hectares) with potential to generate 1,000 MW. Meanwhile, some experts hope that the high-profile example set by the government in Islamabad will encourage uptake of domestic solar energy kits for individual households. Many remain unconnected to the electricity grid, or are suffering from the country’s chronic power shortages. But the government and the private sector must take measures to incentivise consumers, they argue. Parliament House, where both the National Assembly and Senate meet, was designed to be centrally air-conditioned. “The consumption of electricity in the parliament even jumps over 2 MW in summers when the house is in session,” Shah said. The solar energy plant will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as overcoming the frequent and prolonged power outages that affect the buildings, he added. Pakistan faces a year-round electricity shortfall which rises to about 7,000 MW in the summer months, leaving the majority of its citizens without continuous supplies for extended periods each day. The power situation is worse in off-grid homes. According to a World Bank report, around 44% of households are not connected to the grid. More than 80% of these are in rural areas, where a World Bank survey found that 30-45% of households use kerosene as a primary or secondary source of lighting. Promoters of solar power see an opportunity, despite the lack of infrastructure. Iftikhar Ahmad Qaisrani, founder of the Renewable Energy Society for Education, Awareness Research and Community Help (RESEARCH), an Islamabad-based organisation representing the renewable energy sector, said Pakistan is blessed with 320 days of sunshine per year and around eight hours of sun per day. Solar home systems could be a widespread solution, as long as they can be made affordable, he believes. Pakistan’s neighbours India and Bangladesh already benefit significantly from solar power, having converted most of their irrigation systems to this renewable source, which also provides off-grid power to thousands of homes, Qaisrani noted. “Installation of solar power is a one-time expenditure and people should be encouraged to avail (themselves of) the opportunity,” he added. “This is the right time to encourage the public and private sector to focus on solar energy and provide off-grid solutions to people living in far-flung areas of the country.” Converting a single home to solar power may cost $3,500 to $4,000, but if correctly installed, the system can provide uninterrupted electricity for 25 years, Qaisrani said. “Pakistan can also save millions of dollars (in) foreign reserves per annum just by switching to solar power,” Qaisrani added. The country uses fossil fuels to generate around 65% of its electricity. Over half of that fuel must be imported, and as prices rise on international markets, Pakistan’s electricity is becoming more expensive. Manufacturers in Pakistan rely on imports for the components of solar power systems, as no solar cells or photovoltaic panels are manufactured locally. Solar panels are brought in from Germany, Japan and China, while batteries are both imported and locally manufactured. The cost of components for solar home systems remains high because a 32% import duty is levied on solar photovoltaic cells, 10% on batteries, and 15% on ready-made solar lanterns. Abdul Hanan Siddhu, a solar energy consultant, said solar home systems could be up to 20% cheaper if import duties on solar panels were abolished. In addition, the government should exempt solar components from the general sales tax of 17%, he said. “The government should also encourage local manufacturers to start cell manufacturing to reduce the cost,” he added. On top of this, government subsidies could help boost the solar off-grid lighting sector. While lack of awareness about the advantages of solar energy has kept the market small, people are beginning to turn to solar power partly in response to prolonged power outages, Siddhu added. RESEARCH’s Qaisrani acknowledged there is as yet no national strategy to promote solar lanterns or solar home systems, but described parliament’s conversion to solar power as “encouraging”. • Aamir Saeed is a journalist based in Islamabad"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/jun/01/george-osborne-accused-of-exacerbating-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-01T18:16:53Z","webTitle":"George Osborne accused of making climate change worse with tax breaks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/01/george-osborne-accused-of-exacerbating-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jun/01/george-osborne-accused-of-exacerbating-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne accused of making climate change worse with tax breaks","bodyText":"Friends of the Earth has accused the chancellor George Osborne of exacerbating climate change by handing out £2.7bn of incentives to energy companies to fuel North Sea oil and gas production. FoE said he was too focused on propping up oil companies at the expense of making renewable energy cheaper. David Powell, economics campaigner at FoE, said: \"The chancellor falls over himself to claim renewable energy is expensive, while bending over backwards to offer oil barons massive tax breaks. \"Reducing the tax bill for rich oil companies will either bolster their already fat profits, or cause more climate changing fossil fuels to be extracted that would have been left in the ground, or both.\" FoE said field allowances that were first introduced in 2009 by Alistair Darling have been significantly expanded by Osborne. With huge subsidies planned to encourage fracking and further cuts to subsidies for wind farms and solar energy on the horizon, Osborne has come under intense pressure from environmental groups to change course. FoE has calculated that if taken up in full, 32 new or existing North Sea oil and gas fields qualified for allowances awarded in 2013-14 worth a total of £2.7bn to the industry over five years. The £2.7bn is how much tax companies would otherwise have had to pay on their profits from oil and gas extraction. In 2012-13, 28 fields received tax breaks totalling £1.95bn, FoE said.

Still, I had no idea what they were seeing. Talking to one of the festival directors, I found out this was Project 84, an Orwell-inspired show communicating with its audience via their mobile phones. Its artists are still figuring things out, but in that moment, the audience were right there with them. Crack, part of the wider festival, This Is Not Art, brings together new performance from across Australia every October long weekend. Performances are often cross-art and experimental, ranging from work in development through to finished shows. Everywhere there is a sense of the rough and ready. All events are free, catering comes in the form of toasties, drinks are BYO and the venue’s major design feature is cardboard boxes. To this roughness, artists and audiences bring passion and love. And the two highlights of this year’s program were completed works, where we could fully see and engage with the artists’ vision. Under spotlights in a dusty corner of the Crack House, Brisbane artist Scott Wings firmly grabbed his audience’s hearts and refused to let go as he ran around performing Icarus Falling. Cutting the Greek myth of Icarus through with contemporary takes on difficult families, love, heartbreak and depression, the work was raw, honest and occasionally thrilling, delicately toeing the line between humour and heartbreak. As the dirt built up on the souls of Wing’s feet, it’s hard to imagine he could find a more perfect venue, but this exciting new Australian performance deserves to be seen widely. Josephine Were’s Three Wishes won’t be experienced beyond Newcastle, at least not in this iteration. If only for 40 minutes, the audio tour took us out of our festival bubble as we walked from Hunter Street mall to Newcastle beach, engaging with the city and the people who live there.

Answers ranged from the small and personal (“more toys” says a six-year-old boy; another woman: “It would be nice if sushi could be delivered”) to the big and political (“improved solar energy”; “Tony Abbott not to be prime minister”, “no more immigration: keep Australia Australian”). Together they painted a complex picture in a piece that managed to calm and confront by turns. A number of shows here will be developed into complete works, other artists may just pick up on the strongest strands to create something new. Although we were only given a staged reading, Will O’Mahony’s Tonsils + Tweezers is already an exciting piece of new writing exploring the long-term repercussions of personal tragedies. Read by the Perth-based writer and three young actors, the play is a serious look at the nature of grief with a playful touch to its structure. Some work, as always, was disappointing, sometimes because the artists hadn’t been fully able to achieve their vision, elsewhere because it showed a naivety we should be beyond, such as the white Australian man rapping about how rap music is now only about money. Then there was the work that was silly and messy and fun, which thrives in an environment like this: the ghost doing stand-up; a drunk artist at the microphone begging for a place to spend the night; audience members forced to trawl through a thousand matches to find a hidden toothpick. Three hours by train from Sydney, Crack can feel removed from the rest of the Australian theatre scene. For one weekend a year it pops up, consuming the lives of those who attend; perhaps overlooked by those who don’t. But its artists will return to their home cities, regroup, and send their art out into the world again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2015/jan/24/bristol-green-capital-2015-eco-sustainable","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-24T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Why Bristol’s eco aura won it European Green Capital 2015 status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/24/bristol-green-capital-2015-eco-sustainable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2015/jan/24/bristol-green-capital-2015-eco-sustainable","fields":{"headline":"Why Bristol’s eco aura won it European Green Capital 2015 status","bodyText":"Bristol is a city with one foot in the countryside. Acres of hilly allotments slope into wildlife corridors and riverside cycle paths. It’s big on slow food, urban farmers’ markets, city farms and free-range thinking (think street art, independent shops, an independent mayor, and a local currency – the Bristol Pound is now widely accepted). The BBC’s Natural History Unit is based here; so is transport charity Sustrans and the ethical Triodos Bank. And now, thanks to all this grassroots greenery, Bristol is the first UK city to be named a European Green Capital since the awards began in 2010. The year-long eco-fest begins on 24 January. Things to do Hire a bike from Cycle the City and pedal around Bristol’s hilly but bike-friendly streets. It’s a hub of national cycle routes: a good off-road route follows the disused railway line – part of Sustrans’ route 41 – which runs through the Avon Gorge. Though marred by the three-lane Portway road, the rocky gorge is a haven for rare plants, as well as peregrine falcons and feral goats. It is crossed by Brunel’s iconic suspension bridge, slung between the Georgian terraces of Clifton and the Forestry Commission’s Leigh Woods. From April, the woods will be the backdrop for an installation, called Withdrawn, by artist Luke Jerram. Part of the National Trust’s New Art Bristol project, Withdrawn will feature a series of ghostly fishing boats marooned in the forest, and aims to raise questions about climate change and its impact on our marine environment. Other events include the Blue Whale Project (a 30-metre walk-in whale to be installed in Millennium Square for six months from mid-April), and Big Green Week in June, with entertainment from film and food to fashion. During August’s Balloon Fiesta, local manufacturer Cameron Balloons will launch a solar-powered hot-air balloon. A series of summer open days are planned for Triodos Renewables’ wind farm in industrial Avonmouth, which is also home to a biomethane plant which supplies the gas for a human-waste Bio-Bus that runs from Bristol airport to Bath. The At-Bristol Science Centre on the Harbourside is planning behind-the-scenes tours of its low-energy building – one of the UK’s greenest. (Green-tech marvels include a phase-change tank for storing solar energy, waste baling and a rooftop photovoltaic system, guarded by Brian, a robotic peregrine falcon.) Front of house, the centre entertains with an array of interactive playthings: a planetarium, a walk-through virtual tornado and a DIY animation station – complete with Bristol-born Wallace and Gromit film set. You can’t do Bristol without a bit of Aardman Animations. Where to eat Among the many local restaurants that subscribe to the Slow Food movement, a few stand out. In a recycled warehouse on the waterfront, Bordeaux Quay boasts a sustainable approach to everything from ingredients to waste management. The food isn’t cheap (mains from £13.50), but it has a three-star rating from the Sustainable Restaurant Association for its humanely raised meat, home-baked artisan bread and wild, day-boat fish. It has nice views of the harbour, too. Another three-star restaurant is The Canteen in Stokes Croft, Bristol’s centre of alternative culture. It’s part of Hamilton House, a solar-powered, converted office building which houses a community of artists, musicians and charities and the Bristol Bike Project. Choose from a chalk-board menu – maybe beetroot and spinach gnocchi with garden-pea sauce (£8), or steamed Fowey mussels (£8.50). There is live music every night, 10% of profits go to local causes and you get a free bowl of soup with every meal. Bristol is very good at homegrown micro chains. One of them, Friska – with four cafe-takeaways around the city – was recently named best ethical restaurant by Observer Food Monthly. Try one of its tasty hot boxes (Thai chicken curry or grilled halloumi with roast veg, £5.25). The curse of takeaway waste is neatly taken care of by the Thali Café chain’s excellent tiffin scheme (tiffin dishes are really between-meal snacks, but can be eaten as mains). You buy a Mumbai-style stainless steel tiffin pot and make regular trips to your local Thali Café (there are four of them) for refills. Some 10,000 people in the city now have a Thali tiffin (dishes start at £8.95 and are served with rice and dahl). Menu highlights include Goan fish curry, Punjab kebabs and masala dosas, all inspired by Indian street food. Finally, there’s the “junk food” option: Skipchen is a pop-up, pay-as-you-feel cafe in Stokes Croft that sources most of its ingredients from supermarket surplus. For a voluntary donation, you might try kiln-roasted salmon with watercress and white wine sauce. The food is on the cusp of a best-before date, but nobody’s died. Where to stay The only B&amp;B in the city to earn a Green Tourism gold award is The Greenhouse in Southville (doubles from £105 B&amp;B). Fitted carpets are made from recycled plastic, there’s wool insulation under the floors, solar panels on the roof, a bike store and electric bikes for hire, but the rooms are otherwise conventional. More central is Rockets on the Roof at Brooks Guesthouse (doubles from £70), which offers glamping in four British-made Airstream lookalikes on an astroturfed rooftop four floors above historic Corn Street. Each polished-metal caravan has a double bed, eco-heating and shower, LED lights (including coloured mood lights) and views of spires and clock towers. Bristol’s Airbnb listings include a “modern, inner-city eco house” in a corner of the delightfully untidy garden of a former farmhouse on Redland Green, which has three bedrooms, a wood-burner and a heat-exchange boiler (from £135 a night, sleeps five); and, in a suburban street close to the M32 flyover, a “Cosy Eco Cabin” (£49 a night) is set among fruit trees in a large bucolic garden overlooking the Frome river and Eastville Park lake. From this woody cabin with outdoor compost loo, you can look out for swans and kingfishers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/may/25/fracking-energy-solution-solar-shale-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-25T12:39:41Z","webTitle":"This fracking zeal overshadows the perfect energy solution – solar | Leonie Greene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/25/fracking-energy-solution-solar-shale-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/may/25/fracking-energy-solution-solar-shale-gas","fields":{"headline":"This fracking zeal overshadows the perfect energy solution – solar","bodyText":"The government's consultation on the rights of fracking companies to drill under your home was published the day after the local and European elections, hours after the polls closed. Perhaps that was a wise move given that public support for fracking seems to be falling. It hardly needs former Conservative energy secretary Lord Howell to warn that fracking \"could prove extremely dangerous politically\". The careful timing on the latest announcement shows he may not be the only one who thinks so. The British Geological Survey has said there could be 4.4bn barrels of oil in the shale rocks of southern England. As a result, the announcement proposes a 12-week consultation on a law that would bypass the law of trespass when it comes to work carried out 300 metres or more below ground, and payments to affected communities of £20,000 for each well drilled. The government's enthusiasm for fracking sits in stark contrast to its erratic rhetoric and actions on solar energy. The solar industry has recently been ambushed by a fourth review in less than three years. Constant policy upheaval makes investment to reduce costs difficult, and the latest review is particularly ill considered. Usually governments offer a grace period to investors if they are going to change financial arrangements, but this one offers almost none – which means many emerging solar companies that invested in good faith are set for a financial hit. For all the rhetoric about a shift to rooftop solar, the government's own policy framework actually limits this important market. Poor solar farms have attracted negative local press, as they should do. Certainly, real concerns such as displacing food production must be addressed by the industry and planners. But a great many more good quality solar farms have been established invisibly, screened with trees and hedges, and they have been welcomed by local communities and by major conservation groups like the RSPB (because of the haven they can offer wildlife), and by farmers hit by weather extremes as the climate changes. Solar farms can be installed in weeks and then nothing really happens for decades: no noise, no smell, no waste. Yet benign solar farms have been labelled \"monstrous\" by ministers who have nothing to say about fracking's \"whiff of diesel\" or its \"thump of compressors that can be sensed up to two miles away\" (Lord Howell again). Not to mention the regular heavy truck traffic or intensive water consumption, or the strict regulatory controls needed to prevent methane leaks on which its carbon-saving case depends. The double standards here are rather extraordinary. The bias is hard to fathom when solar has delivered beyond the expectations of even its greatest advocates. Costs in the UK have dropped 30% in 18 months and large-scale solar is now our second cheapest major renewable energy source. But ministers must understand that they can't wait for solar energy costs to fall, because most of the costs are not the technology – they are grid connections, infrastructure, planning, skilled staff and other \"soft\" costs. Reaching the cheapest solar possible in the UK means sustained investment by British SMEs, not just waiting for fair international prices. In the US, the land of shale gas, the White House's SunShot initiative is on track to drive solar below the cost of gas by 2020. That gives them massive international competitive advantage. As Jonathon Porritt said, if you think solar is just part of the solution, you've missed the plot. Far from constraining the British solar industry, the government should be doing everything it can to strengthen the UK's position in a soaring international solar market. What we need politicians to do is to champion good quality solar farms and to liberate the huge potential of the UK's rooftop market. If the government can provide a steady framework, the solar industry can definitely be the cheapest low-carbon technology by around 2018, and ready to take on fossil fuels with no public subsidies at all soon after that. It is time politicians listened a lot less to big polluting international energy companies, and a lot more to British entrepreneurs who are creating real competition and delivering a clean energy revolution through this extraordinarily benign and accessible technology. They should also listen to the public. The Department of Energy and Climate Change's own opinion poll tracker shows solar enjoys its highest approval ratings ever at 85%. It seems the country is firmly behind solar. Westminster must catch up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/12/breakthrough-in-rapid-diagnostics-using-magnets-to-test-for-malaria","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-12T09:40:52Z","webTitle":"Breakthrough in rapid diagnostics: using magnets to test for malaria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/12/breakthrough-in-rapid-diagnostics-using-magnets-to-test-for-malaria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/12/breakthrough-in-rapid-diagnostics-using-magnets-to-test-for-malaria","fields":{"headline":"Breakthrough in rapid diagnostics: using magnets to test for malaria","bodyText":"A team of scientists in Singapore have created a new way to test for malaria within minutes using magnets. “The new technique uses a significantly smaller blood sample to traditional blood-smear methods, and is more sensitive and less error-prone,” says Donhee Ham, professor of electrical engineering at Harvard University. Malaria currently infects over 200 million people worldwide, mainly in developing countries. This new technology could allow hospitals to rapidly screen and monitor patients for malaria at a significantly lower cost per patient, and may be portable enough to be used in the field. So, how does it work? Currently malaria is diagnosed by taking a blood sample from a patient, staining it with a dye, and looking at the sample with a microscope to detect the Plasmodium parasite which causes the disease. This new technique uses magnetic resonance relaxometry (MRR) to detect a parasitic waste in the blood of infected patients. “There is real potential to make this into a field-deployable system, since you don’t need any kind of labels or dye,” says Jongyoon Han, one of the senior authors of the paper. The researchers used a small, 0.5-tesla magnet. The current device prototype is small enough to sit on a lab bench, but the team is also working on a portable version for field-based diagnoses. After taking a blood sample, the analysis takes less than a minute. Only a droplet of blood is needed, making the procedure much less invasive for patients and easier for healthcare workers. Will it be expensive? No. According to researchers the system can be built at a very low cost. “Since this technique does not rely on expensive labelling with chemical reagents, we are able to get individual diagnostic tests carried out at a cost of less than 10 cents,” says Weng Kung Peng, lead author of the paper and research scientist at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology. Is it more reliable than past tests? In the blood-smear test, the blood is stained with a dye that colours cell nuclei. As red blood cells don’t have nuclei, any marks that show up are presumed to be from the parasite. The problem is that technicians don’t always agree on the interpretation of the smears. According to Hans, there’s a lot of variation over what counts as infected red blood cells rather than dust particles stuck on the plate: “It really takes a lot of practice.” Because this new technique relies on magnetic fields to detect the presence of the parasitic waste, it may be more reliable as there is less scope for human error. Is it ready to be used in the field? Not yet. The technology is still in the early stages and will need to be tested and developed further for reliable field deployment. However, the results so far are promising. So promising in fact that researchers are launching a company to make this technology available at an affordable price. The team has also began running field tests in south-east Asia, and is exploring ways to power the device on solar energy, making it more accessible for healthcare workers in poor, rural areas.

And there is a horrible sense of deja-vu that this may not be looking good for the coming summer as a whole. Last year aside, there has been a run of several years of washout summers that often began with heavy rains in spring and especially in May. This may, of course, just simply be bad luck, like throwing dice, or it may be some sort of natural fluctuation in climate. There have been plenty of runs of poor summers in the past, especially some real horrors in the 1950's and 1960's, and further back in the nineteenth century, when the summers were often wetter than the winters. But there are concerns that there may now be a shift in climate that is exposing the British Isles to wetter summers. One suspect that has been blamed is the unprecedented melting of the Arctic ice cap, which has reached record low coverage over recent years. The Arctic is a refrigerator for the Earth's climate – because the sea ice is white, it reflects some 80 per cent of the sunlight over the Arctic back into space and helps cool the atmosphere. But without the ice, the dark sea is exposed, which absorbs some 90 per cent of the solar energy, warming up the sea and upsetting the balance of heat, and possibly climate, across the northern hemisphere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/20/while-didcot-b-burned-renewable-energy-powered-on","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-20T13:35:57Z","webTitle":"While Didcot B burned, renewable energy powered on | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/20/while-didcot-b-burned-renewable-energy-powered-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/20/while-didcot-b-burned-renewable-energy-powered-on","fields":{"headline":"While Didcot B burned, renewable energy powered on","bodyText":"Renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, is frequently criticised for being “unreliable”. But the major fire at RWE’s Didcot gas-fired power station on Sunday evening shows that traditional energy generation is also intermittent. Moreover, accidents at coal, gas and nuclear plants frequently involve much larger amounts of electricity dropping off the grid and at much shorter notice. The Didcot station was running at full capacity on Sunday evening, RWE told me. So the cooling tower fire, which forced unit 5 to close, led to the instantaneous loss of 700MW of electricity just after 8pm. That is about half-a-million-homes-worth of power that the National Grid had to find with zero seconds’ notice. It pulled off this balancing act using a safety net, called the regulating reserve, that it is one of a number of back-ups always on standby to ensure the UK’s electricity supply remains stable. The regulating reserve is a mix of electricity, such as pumped storage and gas power, kept in reserve to compensate for any sudden drop outs. Big power stations shutting at short notice is more common than you might think. The Didcot fire is at least the third at a UK fossil fuel-fired power station in 2014, according to Reuters. In February, fire permanently closed E.ON’s 370MW unit at Ironbridge, while in July, two units at SSE’s 1,000MW Ferrybridge coal plant in West Yorkshire were shut after a fire. Neither is nuclear immune from shutdowns, with EDF Energy taking four of its nuclear reactors offline in August after a crack was found in a boiler. Combined with Didcot B, these unplanned outages alone have removed 7% percent of total electricity generation capacity. The first lesson to draw from the Didcot fire relates to energy security. Due to their size, problems at centralised power plants pose a greater risk to keeping the lights on than the loss of, say, one turbine in a wind farm, or a few solar panels in an array. Power station drop-outs can occur suddenly and for unexpected reasons, like a plague of jellyfish or seaweed, both of which have knocked out nuclear power stations recently. In contrast, wind can be accurately forecast a day or two ahead and the sun rises and sets like clockwork. The risk posed by big plants falling off the grid will rise further if EDF build their 3.2GW nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Such is its size - a “behemoth” according to Owen Paterson - that National Grid is having to ramp up its back-up measures to cope. In a stunning example of perverse logic, the £160m-a-year cost of this bigger safety net is being spread across all energy suppliers, including renewables, because “increasing costs on larger users could delay the commissioning of large nuclear plants”. The second lesson to draw from the Didcot fire is that the intermittency of some renewables is simply not a problem. On Sunday, the same day the Didcot station crashed offline, wind power provided its greatest ever share of UK electricity: 24%. And the lights stayed on. In April, a Royal Academy of Engineering report concluded wind capacity could more than double from today’s 11GW by 2020 without any changes to how the energy system is balanced. The grid can cope. It is ironic that Sunday was also the day that the Conservative party’s war on renewable energy opened a new front, with environment secretary Liz Truss changing farm subsidy rules to undermine solar farms. This is despite solar energy being a “promising technology” whose price is “falling rapidly” – and that’s Tory climate sceptic Tim Montgomerie talking. Renewable energy come out as most popular in every opinion poll, with solar often getting more than 90% approval. It boosts energy security by being both decentralised and not relying on imported fossil fuels. Onshore wind is the cheapest clean energy available, but communities secretary Eric Pickles continues his crusade against it. As the flames of Didcot burned, Truss and Pickles fiddled in order to foil renewable energy and appease the minority of the public who oppose it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/06/revealing-interview-with-top-contrarian-climate-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-06T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"A revealing interview with top contrarian climate scientists | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/06/revealing-interview-with-top-contrarian-climate-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/06/revealing-interview-with-top-contrarian-climate-scientists","fields":{"headline":"A revealing interview with top contrarian climate scientists","bodyText":"In 1990, University of Alabama at Huntsville scientists Roy Spencer and John Christy created a data set that estimates the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere by using instruments on satellites (microwave sounding units) that measure microwave radiation in the atmosphere. According to their latest estimates, the Earth’s lower atmosphere has warmed significantly since satellite measurements began in 1979, but not quite as fast as thermometer measurements of temperatures at the Earth’s surface. Spencer and Christy have also long disputed the degree to which humans are contributing to that warming, and have thus often been called to testify before Congress by policymakers seeking justification to oppose climate legislation. On the 25th anniversary of their satellite data set, Alabama.com interviewed the pair to discuss their science and climate contrarianism. The resulting discussion was quite revealing. Consensus Denial For example, when asked about the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, Christy offered an inaccurate response, The American Meteorological Society did their survey and they specifically asked the question, Is man the dominate controller of climate over the last 50 years? Only 52 percent said yes. That is not a consensus at all in science ... Roy and I have both made the statement that we are in the 97 percent because we believe in some (man-made) effect. Ever since my colleagues and I published our global warming consensus paper two years ago in which we found a 97% consensus in the peer-reviewed literature on human-caused global warming, Roy Spencer has been claiming to be part of the 97%. As I showed two years ago, he’s not. Spencer and Christy each authored five papers captured in our climate science literature survey. Among those papers, we classified one of Spencer’s and two of Christy’s as minimizing or rejecting the human influence on global warming, and the others as not taking a position on the issue. That makes both of them authors of the less than 3% of peer-reviewed climate science papers rejecting the consensus on human-caused global warming. This is an indisputable fact – the 97% consensus figure is based on our team’s categorization of the scientific literature, and we put their research outside the 97% consensus. Spencer and Christy reject this fact because they don’t understand our study – specifically that papers minimizing the human influence on global warming fall outside the 97% consensus. Their research is nevertheless among the 3% of outliers. As for the American Meteorological Society (AMS) survey, only 13% of participants described climate science as their field of expertise. The Heartland Institute – the source of the story linked in the above quote by Christy – misrepresented the associated study so badly that the AMS executive director took the unusual step of issuing a public reprimand against their behavior. Studies of climate science experts have again and again found a 97% consensus on human-caused global warming. Data and Research Quality Spencer and Christy’s data set has undergone many major corrections to address various errors and biases. This is how science always progresses, but those who believe that adjustments to surface temperature measurements are part of a conspiracy (including Roy Spencer) always seem to neglect the major adjustments to the satellite data. In fact, in its early days, Spencer and Christy’s data set seemed to indicate the atmosphere was cooling, before a series of big adjustments were made. As discussed in my book and as a paper that John Abraham and I published with several colleagues last year showed, much of Spencer and Christy’s contrarian research has not withstood subsequent scientific scrutiny. we conclude then that the quality of work of contrarian-view scientists, as showcased here by representative case studies, is notably lower than that of scientists who hold the consensus view ... We find that the scientific literature includes a series of strong responses from the mainstream scientific community including criticisms, corrections, and in some cases, resignation of editors. The contrarian views were often found to be unsubstantiated by the data and are no longer seriously considered by many climate scientists. In fact, the accuracy of Spencer and Christy’s atmospheric temperature estimates remains a question of rigorous scientific dispute today. While the Alabama.com interview says, Still, they carry on - comfortable in their research and data that has remained true to their findings That comfort may very well be misplaced. Conspiracies and Biases When asked about data from government agencies contradicting their contrarian beliefs about the dangers associated with climate change, Christy said, NASA, NOAA, EPA, DOE, those are agencies. Agency leaders are appointed by the government, by the current administration. They do not represent objective independent scientific organizations. They can’t. They are appointed by the head. They try. People who come out with different views in their organizations are found to be squashed. There is an agenda in those agencies ... There are skeptics in NASA and NOAA, a good number. But they are quiet. They know in this administration, they don’t speak out. This is an ironic answer given the recent revelations that scientists in Florida have been barred from using phrases like “climate change” and “global warming.” Similarly, the George W. Bush administration was accused of censoring government reports about climate change. It’s contrarians who have tried to squash inconvenient scientific research, not those who accept the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming. Fossil Fuel Interests The interview also included an extensive discussion about fossil fuels, with Roy Spencer saying, When I talk to scientists who should be objective over a beer at the end of the day, I will argue with them and their final position will always be, ‘Yeah, but we need to get away from fossil fuels anyway.’ Where did that come from? Are you an expert in alternative energy sources and what they cost? How many poor people are you going to hurt? How many more people are you going to make poor through energy poverty because they are paying five to 10 times as much for their energy? Roy Spencer is of course not an energy or economics expert either. Experts in these fields who have published research on the subject have found that fossil fuels are incredibly expensive, when we account for all of their costs. For example, one recent study conservatively estimated that including pollution costs, coal is about 4 times more expensive than wind and 3 times more expensive than solar energy in the USA today. Additionally, poorer countries are generally the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. John Christy made similarly backwards arguments, Carbon dioxide makes things grow. The world used to have five times as much carbon dioxide as it does now. Plants love this stuff. It creates more food. CO2 is not the problem ... There is absolutely no question that carbon energy provides with longer and better lives. There is no question about that. The ‘CO2 is plant food’ argument is a gross oversimplification. For example, rising carbon dioxide levels increase the greenhouse effect, causing global warming, which in turn intensifies droughts. As we’re seeing in California right now (the Golden State turning brown), that’s not good for plants. Christy also made a key mistake in those comments. Energy gives people longer and better lives, but there’s absolutely no reason that energy must come from carbon-intensive fossil fuel sources. In fact, my colleague John Abraham is helping developing countries in Africa deploy clean energy sources instead. Christy and Spencer have also been affiliated with various conservative fossil fuel-funded think tanks. And Spencer is on the Board of Advisors of the Cornwall Alliance – a religious group that essentially believes God wouldn’t let damaging climate change happen. Spencer has also made some controversial comments, calling those who disagree with him “global warming Nazis” as well as declaring “I love FoxNews” and saying, I view my job a little like a legislator, supported by the taxpayer, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimize the role of government. Spencer and Christy made a valuable scientific contribution by creating their atmospheric temperature data set. However, given how few climate scientists dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, it’s useful to examine their research and comments with a critical eye. When we do, it becomes clear that they have less in common with Galileo than with the scientists who disputed the links between smoking and cancer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/nov/06/owens-corning-exec-susutainability-surprises-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-06T21:31:22Z","webTitle":"We must 'do the math': An Owens-Corning exec on sustainability surprises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/06/owens-corning-exec-susutainability-surprises-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/06/owens-corning-exec-susutainability-surprises-interview","fields":{"headline":"We must 'do the math': An Owens-Corning exec on sustainability surprises","bodyText":"Fast facts about Frank O’Brien-Bernini Current role: Vice president and chief sustainability officer at Owens Corning, the world’s largest manufacturer of fiberglass Education: Master’s in Mechanical Engineering (MSME), University of Massachusetts, with a research focus on solar energy. First job: As an undergraduate, I dropped out of school and started a solar design/build firm in Vermont, primarily focused on super-insulated passive solar homes, additions and sunspaces. After graduate school, I joined Owens Corning. I’ve been here for 31 years. Weekend passion: Most Saturdays and Sundays you will find me either road biking (summer) or mountain biking (winter) along the rolling hills and beautiful vistas of central Ohio. I’m also a drummer, and enjoy performing Celtic/Americana/Blues/Rock music in local pubs. His name: In 1978 when we got married, my wife Mary Rose and I decided to put our names together. We thought we’d start a trend, but few followed. She was the O’Brien and I was the Bernini. We are very happy with our choice! If I wasn’t doing this, I would be... Trying to develop affordable, sustainable housing that current renters could afford to buy. I believe there is enormous opportunity for innovation in this area, across our diverse geographies. More of our young adults and families need better opportunities to gain a foothold on their future. Your company’s statement of purpose is unusually broad: “Our people and products make the world a better place.” How so? Many companies probably could say a thing like that. We’re trying to make it real every day. More importantly, we’re trying to measure it. We have three big franchises — insulation, roofing and composites, which includes glass-fiber reinforcements for wind turbine blades and composites for vehicle light-weighting. Our data tells us that we are making a net-positive impact to the world. We’re going to get it peer-reviewed and make sure it is academically sound before we publish it. But our hope is to advance the way the world looks at sustainability. What, then, are you trying to measure? We look at all of the the energy that it takes to make, distribute and install our products, including the whole supply chain. And then we look at the energy saved by our products over their life. That’s monstrously larger. So the world needs more of us, not less. Is this what you mean by the company’s “footprint” and “handprint”? That’s right. After more than a decade of targeted environmental footprint reduction, which is about reducing our negative impact, my attention is currently focused on handprint expansion, increasing our positive impact. Here’s an example: If you take all the energy, from raw materials through installation, that it takes to insulate a typical 2400 square foot house in Chicago, you could take that amount of energy and drive a typical car across the US. While that seems like a lot of energy, if you look at the energy saved by that insulation, over the life of the home, you could use that energy to drive that same car to the moon, and back, five times. That’s our handprint. What frustrates you? It may seem trite, but I actually don’t get frustrated, which can frustrate others. That said, the constant stream of misinformation in the sustainability space comes close. I imagine well-intentioned people, trying to make a difference, using incorrect guidance to yield no impact and wasted resources. This gets back to the quantification of impact. Suppose I decide that I’m not going to eat meat because of its environmental impact. The conventional wisdom is the meat equals bad and green equals good. But if the meat in my local stores comes from a farm down the road where the cattle are grass-fed, and the salads come shipped from California with lots of packaging, that might be a bad idea. If you don’t do the math, you might be trying to do good for the world and get it backwards. Away from work, what do you do to live more sustainably? My wife and I deep retrofitted (energy efficiency) our 110-year-old home. I drive a Prius. We recycle and compost, and my leisure time is spent in low/no carbon cycling and drumming. We have have a vegetable garden and eat little meat, and we live in a highly walk-able village (Granville, Ohio) with shops, restaurants, concerts, local college campus events etc. That said, our kids live far away and our family enjoys scuba diving, both resulting in an air travel greenhouse gas challenge!

The facility, to be located on 20,000 acres (30 square miles) of land owned by Rajasthan’s government and a salt-producing firm, would have a capacity of 4,000 megawatts of electricity, and cost $1.2 billion in the first phase. India today uses an average of 772,000 gigawatt hours of power annually. A.N. Srivastava, director of the country’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said in an interview the project should have a lifespan of 25 years, and would reduce the country’s carbon footprint by over 4 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. Currently 67% of India’s energy requirements are met by rapidly depleting coal deposits, he said, and “to offset this dependency, India needs a clean energy revolution”. Backers say the project will sit on dried-up land no longer required for salt production. “There is almost 30 square miles of barren land surrounding the (Sambhar Lake) site which could be well-utilised for green energy production,” R.K. Tandon, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Salts Limited, one of the partners in the solar plant, said in an interview with Thomson Reuters Foundation. The project fits under India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change, which calls for greater use of renewable energy, and would be environmentally friendly, he added. The project aims to cut prices for solar energy and close a huge gap between power production and power demand in rural areas as per capita consumption of power grows in India, from about 780 kilowatt hours per person in 2009-10 to more than 880 kilowatt hours per person in 2011-12, according to the country’s 12th five-year plan. But the government has not yet announced the project’s boundaries, and environmental experts fear it may touch on Sambhar Lake wetlands protected under the international Ramsar Convention, and that it could also affect nearby villages and illegal settlements encroaching on the wetlands. The company providing the land for the project controls 58,000 acres (90 square miles) in the area, and the catchment of Sambhar Lake covers 60 square miles, according to the Sambhar Master Plan prepared by the state government. Sambhar Lake is one of the largest salt-producing areas in India, and has been used for salt production since the 1870s. The lake basin is spread at the confluence of three districts of Rajasthan – Jaipur, Nagaur and Ajmer – and is close to the fringes of the desert. The lake depends on rainwater supplies, which have been declining in the area as a result of changing weather patterns and greater use of water by the growing town of Sambhar, with 24,000 people, and by close to 100 small illegal settlements in the catchment area. Over the past several decades, large areas of land surrounding the lake have dried out and no longer flood regularly. This is the land the government now hopes to use to build the solar farm, Tandon said. Sambhar Lake, an important habitat for birds, particularly flamingos, is among 25 wetlands of international importance in India. India’s Wetlands Conservation and Management Rules 2010 prohibit the setting up of industries in flood areas or industrial activity likely to have an adverse impact on wetland ecosystems, according to a Ministry of Environment and Forests official. Such rules may drive the final footprint of the solar project. Such a project would have to be approved by 12 members of the Central Wetlands Regulatory Authority including seven officials from key ministries such as Environment and Forests, Water, and Agriculture, as well as five environmentalists or other leading experts, the official said. Some experts also fear that the proposed 20,000-acre footprint of the project may need to be reduced to meet wetland rules, reducing the target for power generation. Under government policies, about 5,000 acres of land is required for each 1,000 megawatts of solar energy produced. “It is likely that the solar power project may face a space crunch due to existing encroachments around the catchment area of the lake, hence reducing the area for the project site,” said Abhishek Goyal, a New Delhi-based energy consultant for solar energy companies in India. The government is expected over the next few months to invite bids to carry out the project. Hindustan Salts Ltd. recently invited bids for detailed feasibility studies and analysis of the project, according to its website. India plans to seek $500 million in loans for the project from the World Bank for the first 750 megawatt phase of the project, which would cost $1.2 billion, Minister of Renewable Energy Farooq Abdullah said in a statement. In the coming months, the government is expected to sign agreements to set up similar solar facilities in Kharagoda (Gujarat), Kargil and Ladakh (Jammu and Kashmir) under the country’sJawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, which aims to produce 20 gigawatts of solar power each year by 2022. Sunny India receives solar energy each year equivalent to nearly 5,000 trillion kilowatt hours per year, experts say – . So far, however, India has only about 2,000 megawatts of grid-connected solar. A memorandum to establish the Sambhar Lake project was signed in late January by six Indian public-sector companies, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Power. • Saket S. is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi and Rajasthan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/apr/02/corporate-america-climate-change-fight-epa","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-02T15:37:54Z","webTitle":"Why Corporate America is reluctant to take a stand on climate action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/02/corporate-america-climate-change-fight-epa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/02/corporate-america-climate-change-fight-epa","fields":{"headline":"Why Corporate America is reluctant to take a stand on climate action","bodyText":"Many environmental groups consider the Obama administration’s plan to regulate carbon-spewing coal plants, which aims to cut carbon pollution by 30%, as one of our last chances to win the fight against climate change. But the vast majority of their top corporate partners – companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, FedEx, UPS, Target and Walmart, which have worked with environmental NGOs for years – aren’t backing them up, according to a Guardian survey. The survey consisted of calls and emails to nearly 50 corporations that work with three environmental groups – Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund US – that have identified the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan as a top priority. These are Fortune 500 global companies that tout their sustainability efforts and celebrate their environmental partnerships. Just three of them – Starbucks, Mars and Google – support the Clean Power Plan, which is a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s climate change efforts. Caterpillar and CSX Corp, a coal-carrying railroad, oppose the EPA plan. The vast majority take no position. The reluctance of companies to take a stand raises questions about the depth of partnerships between companies and NGOs. By remaining quiet, these companies make it harder for the EPA to roll out the plan in the face of vehement opposition from fossil fuel companies and Republicans. “Silence isn’t neutral,” says Anne Kelly of Ceres, who is organizing companies to support the EPA. The lack of public support could jeopardize the clean power plan, and – if the US isn’t able to make a strong climate commitment as a result – could ultimately undermine the success of the global climate talks in Paris this year. The companies that won’t get involved say it’s because the regulation of power plant emissions is not core to their business. Environmentalists maintain that climate change is everybody’s business. The Environmental Defense Fund, for example, says the EPA Clean Power Plan is “the most significant step in US history toward reducing the pollution that causes climate change”. More than 480,000 EDF members have signed petitions backing the EPA. Fred Krupp, EDF’s president, said: “Hiding from challenges is not what Americans do.” Yet EDF’s corporate partners would appear to be doing just that. AT&amp;T, DuPont, KKR, McDonald’s, Ocean Spray and Walmart are all sitting out the debate over what some activists describe as a make-or-break climate change initiative. It’s the same story with the corporate allies of The Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund. Lou Leonard, vice president for climate policy at WWF, says: “We think that companies should, absolutely, be engaging on climate policy.” Thus far, though, WWF has failed to bring along its partners, including such corporate giants as Bank of America, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble. In an email, Coca-Cola says: “Our sustainability priorities are women, water and well-being – all areas that tie closely to our business.” Bank of America, which helps finance the coal industry, says by email: “We don’t have any information to share right now on the EPA Power Plan.” P&amp;G did not respond to emails requesting comment. You can read all the corporate responses to the Guardian inquiries here. Their silence means the loudest business voices on climate policy issues in Washington or the state capitals come from conservative trade groups, such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Farm Bureau Federation, which strongly oppose the EPA’s rules. The stakes are high. Electric power plants are the single largest source of carbon pollution in the US, accounting for roughly one-third of US domestic greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA was required to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants, and in 2013, Obama announced the agency’s intention to reduce power plant emissions. Since then, the EPA has proposed regulations for new and existing plants, while delegating many of the particulars to states to permit flexible rule-making. For the most part, supporters and opponents agree that the rules would make it all but impossible to build new coal plants, requiring some existing coal plants to shut down and raising the cost of electricity. That’s where the agreement ends. The EPA says the climate and health benefits from its plan far outweigh the estimated annual costs, a position embraced by green groups. Aside from EDF, WWF and The Nature Conservancy, activist groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace also support the plan. US climate action, they say, is especially important as the world moves closer to global climate talks later this year in Paris. “It is an enormously high priority for The Nature Conservancy,” says Mark Tercek, the group’s president and CEO. The EPA’s opponents, who have organized as the Partnership for a Better Energy Future, say that the power plant rules will raise energy costs to unacceptable levels, put US manufacturing at risk, threaten the reliability of the electricity grid and accomplish little in the way of greenhouse gas reductions. The issue has become a partisan battleground. This month, US Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the Senate majority leader, urged governors to refuse to enact the power plant rules. The partisan nature of the debate is one reason why green groups have proven unable to enlist the support of their corporate allies. Businesses would rather not alienate powerful Republicans like McConnell. As Glenn Prickett, chief external affairs officer for the Nature Conservancy, says: “Big companies that might be willing to join a bipartisan legislative effort are not going line up behind an initiative of the Obama administration strongly opposed by Republicans.” The Nature Conservancy and EDF are working together on a longer-term plan to build a bipartisan coalition for climate action in Congress, which is unlikely until after the 2016 presidential election. The other reason why companies have stayed out of the fight is that they tend to save their lobbying power for matters that directly concern their interests. FedEx, for example, as an operator of trucks, supported the first-ever fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for US commercial vehicles, which were enacted in 2007. FedEx is also one of the 20 biggest commercial users of solar energy, according to the Solar Electric Industries Association. But Mitch Jackson, who leads FedEx’s sustainability efforts, explained by email that the company isn’t taking a position on the power plant rules because they are “not directed at our industry sector”. Likewise, the head of government relations for one of the world’s biggest companies told the Guardian: “There’s a reluctance if a regulation doesn’t get into your core competency to get into somebody else’s backyard. It’s an unspoken acknowledgment that you stick to your knitting.” Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan Chase all have high-profile sustainability programs and NGO partners, but they won’t engage in the coal-plant fight. “We have not taken a policy position on climate, or any other issue not directly related to finance,” says Matthew Arnold, head of environmental affairs at JPMorgan Chase. By contrast, Google, Mars and Starbucks publicly support the EPA plan. In comments filed with the EPA, Google asked that the plan be strengthened. “EPA’s assessment of the potential for cost-effective, renewable energy opportunities is, if anything, conservative,” the company said. Mars and Starbucks signed a letter to Obama put together by Ceres’ Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy project. Other companies with $1bn or more in revenues that signed the letter include EMC Corp, IKEA, KB Home, Kellogg, Levi Strauss, Nestle, Novelis, SunPower, Symantec, Unilever and VF Corp. Some companies have staked out a middle ground. Dow Chemical and GE filed comments on the EPA rules recommending improvements. Boeing and 3M have joined companies in the power sector in a small group called the National Climate Coalition, which support EPA’s goal of significantly reducing power-plant emissions, but are trying to influence the rules to insure that electricity remains reliable and affordable, according to Robert Wyman, an environmental lawyer with Latham &amp; Watkins, who coordinates the coalition. “We’re here to get to yes,” he says. “We’re not here to fight about the science.” The fact that so few companies are willing to push for coal-plant regulation frustrates some environmentalists. The Environmental Defense Fund organized a webinar to explain the importance of the EPA plan to its corporate partners, says Tom Murray, who leads the nonprofit’s corporate partnerships. “The next step up the corporate sustainability leadership curve needs to be aligning what you’re doing on corporate sustainability and strategy with policy advocacy,” he says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/2014/nov/13/philae-lander-tight-spot-comet-tough-decisions-esa-rosetta","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-13T21:08:37Z","webTitle":"Rosetta: Philae tight spot on comet prompts tough decisions for Esa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/13/philae-lander-tight-spot-comet-tough-decisions-esa-rosetta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2014/nov/13/philae-lander-tight-spot-comet-tough-decisions-esa-rosetta","fields":{"headline":"Rosetta mission: Philae tight landing spot on comet prompts tough decisions for Esa","bodyText":"The robotic lander that touched down on a comet on Wednesday came to rest on its side in the shadow of a cliff, according to the first data beamed home from the probe. Pictures from cameras on board the European Space Agency’s Philae lander show the machine with one foot in the sky and lodged against a high cliff face that is blocking sunlight to its solar panels. The precarious resting place means mission controllers are faced with some tough decisions over whether to try and nudge the spacecraft into a sunnier spot. If successful, that would allow Philae to fully recharge its batteries and do more science on the comet, but any sudden move could risk toppling the lander over, or worse, knock it off the comet completely. The washing machine-sized lander was released by its Rosetta mother ship at 0835am GMT on Wednesday morning and touched down at a perfect spot on the comet’s surface. But when anchoring harpoons failed to fire, the probe bounced back off into space. So weak is the gravitational pull of the comet that Philae soared 1km into the sky and did not come down again until two hours later. “We made quite a leap,” said Stephan Ulamec, the Philae lander manager. In the time it took the probe to land for the second time, the comet had rotated, bringing more treacherous terrain underneath. The spacecraft bounced a second time and finally came to a standstill on its side at what may be the rim of an enormous crater. Technically, the agency pulled off not only the first landing on a comet in history, but the second and third too. “We bounced twice and stopped in a place we’ve not entirely located,” said Jean-Pierre Bibring, Philae’s lead scientist. Teams of scientists are now trying to work out where the probe is. What mission controllers do know is that they are not where they hoped to be. “We are exactly below a cliff, so we are in a shadow permanently,” Bibring added. With most of Philae in the dark, the lander will receive only a fraction of the solar energy that Esa had hoped for. The spacecraft needs six or seven hours of sunlight a day but is expected to receive just one and a half. Though it can operate for 60 hours on primary batteries, the probe must then switch to its main batteries which need to be recharged through its solar arrays. If Philae’s batteries run out it will go into a hibernation mode until they have more power. The spacecraft was designed with landing gear that could hop the probe around, but from its awkward position on its side the option is considered too risky. Though caught in a tight spot, the Philae lander’s systems appear to be working well. The Rosetta spacecraft picked up the lander’s signal on Thursday morning and received the first images and more instrument data from the surface of the comet. One of Philae’s major scientific goals is to analyse the comet for organic molecules. To do that, the lander must get samples from the comet into several different instruments, named Ptolemy, Cosac and Civa. There are two ways to do this: sniffing and drilling. Sniffing involves opening the instruments to allow molecules from the surface to drift inside. The instruments are already doing this and returning data. Drilling is much riskier because it could make the lander topple over. Newton’s third law of motion says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the minuscule gravity of the comet, any movement on Philae will cause motion. The drill turning one way will make Philae want to turn the other. Pushing down into the surface will push the lander off again. “We don’t want to start drilling and end the mission,” said Bibring. But the team has decided to operate another moving instrument, named Mupus, on Thursday evening. This could cause Philae to shift, but calculations show that it would be in a direction that could improve the amount of sunlight falling on the probe. A change in angle of only a few degrees could help. A new panoramic image will be taken after the Mupus deployment to see if there has been any movement. Meanwhile, the Rosetta orbiter team will continue to try to pinpoint Philae’s position. This will be done with images from the mother ship’s Osiris wide-angle camera and its Concert radar instrument. The Concert instrument communicates with Philae and is designed to beam radar through the interior of the comet to reveal the internal structure. When Rosetta is directly overhead, Concert can also help to pinpoint the lander’s position. “When we see where we are, we can decide what to do next,” said Bibring. But time is tight, the first 24 hours of the battery life will soon be gone. It is expected to be completely drained sometime on Saturday. “We are running against the clock,” admits Bibring, “Don’t put the emphasis on failure, it is gorgeous where we are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/01/uganda-antigay-law-lgbt","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-01T18:48:31Z","webTitle":"World in a week: Uganda's courts overturn 'backward' anti-gay law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/01/uganda-antigay-law-lgbt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/01/uganda-antigay-law-lgbt","fields":{"headline":"World in a week: Uganda's courts overturn 'backward' anti-gay law","bodyText":"Good week for Pedro Alonso, who has been appointed director of the WHO Global Malaria Program.

With the number of middle-class consumers predicted to rise to three billion by 2030, and the majority of that growth in developing countries, tackling this problem is no small feat – particularly as rising affluence in urban areas is likely to trigger a higher demand for richer diets and more complex food supply chains. Lack of access to cold chain technology and reliable energy sources are the major reasons for crops perishing after harvest, research by Nottingham University shows (pdf). The cost of delivering energy to remote, rural regions means that, even when storage facilities are built, they may nevertheless stand empty. Poor transport infrastructure causes further losses, and a lack of education on post-harvest practices often results in poor quality control and food being damaged during handling. “Without the technology, expertise and understanding necessary to keep their harvest fresh, smallholder farmers are often locked into a cycle of poverty, unable to access global markets,” says Dr Lisa Kitinoja, founder of the Postharvest Education Foundation. India suffers losses of up to £4.4bn in fruit and vegetables each year due to the absence of effective technologies to keep produce cool. Despite being the world’s largest banana producer, it holds just 0.3% of the global banana market. Production is fragmented compared to the large-scale commercial farms of its competitors, with smallholder farmers typically cultivating small plots with little business or technical support. Less than 4% of India’s fresh produce is transported by cold chain, compared to more than 90% in the UK. Better cold storage, education about food handling and improved infrastructure could help to transform this situation, according a study by Maersk (pdf) – potentially growing the trade of banana containers from 3,000 to 190,000 annually, and benefitting more than 34,000 smallholder farmers across India. Lack of corporate support The Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) estimates that a quarter of food waste in developing countries could be eliminated through use of refrigeration equipment to keep food cold during transit. Clean technology, powered by renewable energy, could allow developing countries to leapfrog the west’s largely fossil-fuel powered cold chain system, according to Tim Fox, IMechE’s head of energy and environment. “We’re currently seeing a bottom-up push for innovative, clean technologies, rather than a top-down push from western food producers and retailers,” says Fox. “Major companies should be more proactive in supporting their producers in developing countries.” However, Kitinoja believes some businesses may have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo of high food losses as this keeps the demand for fertilisers, seeds, tools and services high. Corporate support to date has included Maersk’s sponsorship of the World Food Preservation Center, a collaboration of 10 universities committed to reducing world hunger, and US food processing giant ADM’s funding of the University of Illinois’ Institute for the Prevention of Postharvest Loss – but far more could be done to help producers in the developing world to reduce waste. Small-scale technology In 2013, the Powering Agriculture competition showcased a range of new tools from small-scale technology developers. Among them was India’s Promethean Power Systems, which uses solar energy to cool milk and is aimed at dairy processors collecting from rural farmers. Another winner, developed by the University of Georgia, was a cooling system in Uganda powered by biogas extracted from cow manure. Elsewhere, the American-invented CoolBot thermostatic controller can be coupled with a standard home air conditioner to create low-cost cool rooms, using less energy than an equivalent commercial cooler compressor. Cryogenic energy storage (using low temperature liquids to deliver sustainable energy and cooling) also has potential as a scalable, clean, cold chain technology, concludes IMechE’s Tank of Cold report. For example, the UK’s Dearman Engine Company is pioneering a zero-emission piston engine powered by the expansion of so-called “liquid air.” It has the potential to improve the green credentials of refrigerated transport, and there are plans to integrate it into mainstream commercial vehicle fleets and railway wagons. According to a study (pdf) by the University of Birmingham, liquid air technologies could help to prevent environmental pollution as developing countries such as India look to scale up their use of cold chains. The research estimates that India’s refrigerated vehicle fleet may need to grow 100-fold by 2025. Investing in smallholders Investment remains the major barrier to scaling up such technologies. Governments will need to remove unnecessary red tape, which puts off investors says Fox, particularly where it is holding back large-scale investment in renewable energy. Microfinance initiatives and farmer co-operatives could also help smallholders to purchase equipment and benefit from new technology and infrastructure. “Empowering smallholder farmers with new technology will require significant, widespread, on-the-ground education and training,” Kitinoja concludes. “It’s important to help farmers understand why they should want these solutions. Highlighting the rapid return on investment and the competitive edge they bring is central to encouraging widespread adoption.” Katharine Earley is a journalist and copywriter specialising in sustainability.

High-precision guidance systems and delicate rocket thrusters will enable the project’s two satellites to move in synchrony. And if all goes to plan, European engineers will have created an extraordinary device in orbit. The European Space Agency (Esa) project is breathtaking in its ambition and depends on a level of precision never before achieved in orbit. By flying two or more small satellites in very tight formation, virtual telescopes of incredible power and sensitivity will help astronomers to observe Earth-like planets in orbit around distant stars. These worlds could then be studied to determine if they could support extraterrestrial life. The short-term aim of the Esa Proba-3 project is to improve astronomical studies of the Sun, but it is the long-term potential that really excites. Space telescopes - orbiting outside Earth’s image-distorting atmosphere - will no longer be made of physically connected parts but will consist of components, flying on separate flight paths, that are kept in place by arrays of sensors and thrusters. “There is a limit to the size of a telescope that you can put in a rocket,” said Proba-3’s project manager, Agnes Mestreau-Garreau. “However, if we can demonstrate the effectiveness of this kind of technology it could be used to fly smaller spaceships in formation to create a virtual telescope of incredible power, one that could pinpoint Earth-like planets orbiting close to stars.” The agency’s engineers have already developed sophisticated flight systems that allow them to guide spacecraft with considerable precision. Its automated transfer vehicle, a capsule that supplies the International Space Station with propellant, water, air and other payloads, makes fully automated dockings, a task carried out with centimetre accuracy. Proba-3’s two component craft are intended to fly with even greater precision. To do this, the robotic vessels will use radio- and laser-based technology to maintain highly accurate measurements of their relative positions and attitudes. Tiny thrusters, capable of making delicate changes to the crafts’ positions and relative speeds, will manoeuvre them so that they maintain a perfect attitude above the Earth and maintain a precise distance between themselves. European Space Agency engineers say they intend the two craft to be able to control themselves with an accuracy of one millimetre while keeping them flying in formation while 150 metres apart. One of the satellites will point its instruments towards the Sun. The second will fly on a trajectory that will place it directly between the first craft and the sun and will carry a disc that will occlude it. In this way, a long-lasting total solar eclipse will be created for the first craft, allowing astronomers to use its instruments to study the corona, the Sun’s outer atmosphere. The Sun is a million times brighter than its corona, which only becomes noticeable on Earth during total solar eclipses – when the Moon blots out the Sun’s disc. Instruments called coronagraphs can be attached to telescopes to replicate an eclipse. However, coronagraphs used on ground-based telescopes suffer because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters light coming from the Sun. Orbiting telescopes fitted with coronagraphs avoid this problem and several satellite-borne instruments have been used in the past, allowing astronomers to make key observations that have helped them to understand how the corona transports plasma and solar energy across space to the Earth. Proba-3 is intended to take this science a step further by creating a giant coronagraph from two small satellites flying in a highly accurate formation and will address major mysteries regarding the Sun, including the fact that the corona’s temperature of up to 1,000,000C is vastly hotter than the actual surface of the Sun. Proba-3 may help to solve this puzzle It is not just solar physics that will benefit, however. Astronomers see formation-flying satellites as a solution to the problem of building the large orbiting telescopes they need to study our galaxy and our universe in greater and greater detail. “Success [for the Proba-3 project] would deliver a whole new way of designing and flying space missions, with multiple tightly controlled satellites able to form giant virtual instruments in space, far larger than anything that could be launched in one piece,” said Mestreau-Garreau, who is based at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in the Netherlands. On Earth, extremely large telescopes can be built using modern lightweight materials, but even on high mountain tops they are affected by the distorting effects of the atmosphere. In outer space, this problem is avoided. On the other hand, getting large telescopes into space is tricky. The best known orbiting observatory, the Hubble space telescope, has a relatively small, 2.4-metre diameter mirror for collecting light, its size having been restricted by the dimensions of the hold of the space shuttle that put it into orbit. Its replacement, the James Webb space telescope, although larger, will only be put into orbit by designing its multi-segment mirror so it can be folded up inside its launcher and unfurled in space. However, space engineers accept that there is a limit to their ability to design single instruments that can be squeezed into launchers. The answer, they believe, is to create more formation-flying missions, flotillas of small craft that will be able to carry out all the tasks of a virtual large single telescope. “The key is going to be finding the right way to use the highly precise sensors and instruments that are now available to create a huge telescope from a few smaller craft,” said Mestreau-Garreau. “The potential is immense, however.” LOOKING TO THE STARS ■ The world’s largest optical telescope is the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary Islands, pictured. It has a light collecting surface equivalent to that of a 10.4-metre (34ft) mirror. ■ The twin Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea in Hawaii come a close second. Each has a mirror with a diameter of 10 metres. ■ The Hubble space telescope has a mirror of only 2.4m, while its replacement, the James Webb telescope – scheduled for launch in 2018 – will have a segmented mirror of 6.5 metres. ■ Other mighty star-gazers include the Very Large Telescope at the Paranal Observatory in Chile – at an altitude of 8,645 ft – which has four 8.2m mirrors and four movable 1.8m auxiliary telescopes. ■ Ten years from now, astronomers intend to top all of these instruments – with ease – when the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) at Cerro Armazones in Chile is completed. It will have a working mirror equivalent to nearly 40 metres large enough to probe exoplanet atmospheres in detail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/17/kenya-solar-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-17T14:19:26Z","webTitle":"Kenya to generate over half of its electricity through solar power by 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/17/kenya-solar-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/17/kenya-solar-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"Kenya to generate over half of its electricity through solar power by 2016","bodyText":"Kenya has identified nine sites to build solar power plants that could provide more than half the country's electricity by 2016. Construction of the plants, expected to cost $1.2bn (£73m), is set to begin this year and initial design stages are almost complete. The partnership between government and private companies will see the state contributing about 50% of the cost. Cliff Owiti, a senior administrator at the Kenya Renewable Energy Association, said the move will protect the environment and bring down electricity costs. \"We hope that when the entire project is completed by 2016, more than 50% of Kenya's energy production will consist of solar. Already we are witnessing solar investments in Kenya such as a factory that was opened here in 2011 that manufactures solar energy panels.\" He said that over $500m had already been invested in solar projects in Kenya. \"The costs related with hydro electricity are very high, considering they are influenced by the low water levels in major supply dams. With high investments in solar, we will witness almost no blackouts and power charges will reduce because electricity will be in high supply.\" Germano Mwabu, an economics professor at the University of Nairobi, said the solar plan could have a dramatic impact on energy prices. \"When the project is complete and solar is in good use, electricity costs could go down by as much as 80%.\" The country is also planning the construction of what will be sub-Saharan Africa's largest windfarm, near Lake Turkana, which is set to be operational by 2015. Kenya ranks 22nd in Africa for the amount of electricity it generates, and 46th in the world in the generation of solar energy. But it could rank third for solar in the next four years, according to figures from the Energy Regulatory Commission, a government agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/may/03/climate-change-myths-warming-ice-antarctic-arctic","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-03T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"Climate change: the big myths that need to be exploded","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/03/climate-change-myths-warming-ice-antarctic-arctic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/may/03/climate-change-myths-warming-ice-antarctic-arctic","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: the big myths that need to be exploded","bodyText":"THE EARTH IS WARMER NOW THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN In the distant past, temperatures were far warmer than even the most extreme warming scenarios predicted by the end of the century. Fifty million years ago, during the Eocene, it was on average 10C hotter than today. Forests stretched from pole to pole, the Arctic was inhabited by alligators and squirrel-like primates, and palm trees grew in what is now Alaska. Unlike the current warming trend, though, most natural warm periods in the past developed over thousands, if not millions, of years. “It’s not how much the temperature has gone up – that’s only around 1C over the past 100 years,” says professor Adam Scaife of the Met Office. “What’s unprecedented is the rate of change.” When searching ancient climate records for parallels with the current situation, scientists point to the handful of instances where the Earth’s temperature shifted quickly because of surges in CO2 linked to volcanic activity. Such rapid warming events are often linked in the fossil record to mass extinctions. In common with naturally occurring sudden global temperature changes, scientists can explain the warming observed this century only by factoring in the large rise in CO2 emissions linked to human activity rather than volcanos. CHANGES IN THE SUN’S ACTIVITY CAUSE WARMING The sun is ultimately responsible for warming the Earth, so it seems reasonable that changes in solar activity would influence climate. But can changes observed in the sun explain global warming? Scientists don’t think so. The sun’s activity rises and falls roughly on an 11-year cycle, while temperatures have been rising steadily for a century. “If you just look at global average surface temperatures, there is a small effect that you can associate with solar energy,” says professor Jo Haigh, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College London. “But it’s a very small signal that can’t possibly have done more than greenhouse gas.” During a complete solar cycle, the total energy output of the sun changes by about 0.1%, Haigh says, which, using a typical estimate for climate sensitivity, translates to a change in temperature on Earth of about 0.5C. This means that a dip in solar activity probably contributed in a small way to the slowing of global warming in the past decade. But only a more dramatic drop in solar output – a so-called “super-minimum” – would offset the underlying warming trend. “If the sun went into a state of very low activity, it’s possible, but unlikely,” says Haigh. “There’s no way of forecasting the sun so I wouldn’t hold your breath.” WE WILL BE WORSE OFF IF TEMPERATURES KEEP RISING The world’s infrastructure, from energy to transport to the food we grow, was designed for today’s climate. However, projected changes to climate may be fortuitous for some. A 2014 study, by Public Health England, confirmed that the increase in rates of summer deaths would be more than cancelled out by the drop in winter deaths. David Spiegelhalter, professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, points out: “This study got headlines by claiming that heat-related deaths in the UK were projected to more than double by 2050. However, closer examination of their results revealed that they estimated that the overall death rate due to extreme weather – both hot and cold – would go down in all age groups. It was only because of an ageing population that the overall number of deaths would go up.” A study published last year by the University of East Anglia predicted that global yields of wheat and soybeans would increase for the next 70 years under a “business as usual” scenario, in which carbon dioxide emissions rise rapidly. CO2 is central to the process of photosynthesis and in theory higher levels of CO2 can increase the efficiency by which plants convert sunlight to energy. However, this has to be balanced against the heat stress faced both by plants and agricultural workers.“I think that focusing only on the negative aspects of climate change can risk scientific credibility,” Spiegelhalter says. EXTREME WEATHER IS CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE The floods that gripped Britain in the winter of 2013-14 led to a stronger public belief in human-induced climate change. The storms marked the wettest December to January period since 1876. But some years will always be hotter, wetter or stormier than others. “Asking whether a specific event is down to climate change is really tricky, but you can look at whether that type of event is more likely,” says Professor Adam Scaife. “It’s all about the risk of certain events changing. You can say that a specific type of event is more likely.” For temperature, this calculation is relatively straightforward. “As the climate warms, the range of daily temperatures shifts upwards and at the upper end starts to stretch out into unprecedented territory.” Other extremes are more complex to predict. As the air warms, it can hold more water vapour and this is expected to lead to more rain in some parts of the globe – including Britain. There is already a “hint of a signal” showing that extreme rainfall has increased in this country, although mean rainfall has not yet significantly shifted. ANTARCTIC SEA ICE IS DECREASING Antarctic sea ice extended further than ever recorded during the last southern winter, according to satellite data. This could be taken to mean that Antarctic ice is in robust condition and may appear to confound the basic “warmer world, less ice” narrative. Scientists however say that the observations are less paradoxical than they seem. First, there are no good measurements for the thickness of Antarctic sea ice. “It might be decreasing in the Antarctic, we just don’t know,” says Andy Shepherd, professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds. Second, although the area of ice at the south pole has been growing, this has been a much smaller change than the shrinkage seen at the north pole. “It’s wrong, from a climate perspective, to take this binary view that they balance out,” Shepherd says. Finally, scientists believe that other factors, such as the hole in the ozone layer, which is linked to a cooling effect in the southern hemisphere, may have overshadowed the impact of global warming on the continent. As warming continues, the current growth in the extent of Antarctic ice could be reversed. ARCTIC SEA ICE SEEMS TO BE RECOVERING Discussions about sea ice in the Arctic often confuse two different measures – extent and volume. The extent of ice, although a useful indicator of global temperatures, is also strongly influenced by wind and ocean currents, which alter how densely the ice is packed. “The volume of the ice is really the important number for an assessment of its health,” says Andy Shepherd. Often the two figures don’t match, he points out. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center recently declared this year’s winter maximum for sea ice in the Arctic to be lower than ever, but volume measurements were up on 2013. During the past five years, Arctic ice volume has been relatively stable, but this follows a 30-year downward trend in both volume and extent. “You wouldn’t ever take five years of measurement and say that is the climate signal,” says Shepherd. Scientists’ best projections suggest that any recovery in Arctic sea ice is probably temporary, but that there will be ice at the north pole for at least the next 20 to 30 years. THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON WARMING Scientists disagree about how much warming there has been in the past century, how much there will be in the future and what the environmental impacts might be. The fundamental idea that the world is getting hotter due to human activity is not seriously disputed, however. “The basic physics that CO2 causes warming and that humans are responsible is incredibly well established,” according to Mark Maslin, professor of physical geography at University College London. “If you consider the five IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports, there’s never been science that’s been examined in so much detail.” A survey of the peer-reviewed literature shows that more than 97% of published work supports the idea that warming trends are linked to human activity. After investigating, scientists also found no evidence that papers with a sceptical slant were being systematically rejected by journals. The strength of the consensus appears not to have been conveyed to the public. In a 2014 survey by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, only one in nine people in Britain thought that almost all climate scientists believe that rising temperatures are primarily caused by burning fossil fuels. HUMANS FACE EXTINCTION AS CLIMATE CHANGE INTENSIFIES “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,” President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address in January. The claim is backed up by the IPCC’s 2014 climate impacts assessment, which suggests that a significantly warmer world would present major challenges in terms of health, the economy and food. There is no evidence that the spectre of extinction is looming, however. Even under apocalyptic changes that made parts of the globe uninhabitable, plenty of us would still survive. And we tick most of the boxes – geographical range, being able to survive in a variety of climates and sheer numbers – that predict the species that did well in previous mass extinction events. “We are the perfect weed,” says Maslin. “If you look at the things that have killed a lot of people like Spanish flu or wars, they barely register in the smooth upward population curve. It sounds awful, but it’s really hard to get rid of us.” Climate change might make people in the west poorer and cause increased misery to the very poorest in society, but it will probably take something else to wipe us out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/06/president-obama-will-veto-keystone-xl-pipeline-bill-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-06T20:55:01Z","webTitle":"White House: President Obama would veto Keystone XL pipeline bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/06/president-obama-will-veto-keystone-xl-pipeline-bill-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/06/president-obama-will-veto-keystone-xl-pipeline-bill-white-house","fields":{"headline":"White House: President Obama would veto Keystone XL pipeline bill","bodyText":"Barack Obama would veto a bill aimed at forcing construction of the contentious Keystone XL pipeline, the White House has said, setting up an immediate confrontation with the new Republican-controlled Congress. The White House, ending weeks of speculation about its response to Republican moves on Keystone, said Obama would veto a bill introduced earlier on Tuesday that aims to take the decision over the pipeline out of his hands. “If this bill passes this Congress, the president wouldn’t sign it,” the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said. That position locks the White House on an immediate collision course with the new Congress, after Republicans made it a first order of business to introduce a bill forcing approval of the pipeline. The bill introduced in the Senate on Tuesday would give immediate approval to a Canadian pipeline project that has been waiting more than six years for a decision from the Obama administration. The measure has the support of 63 senators – all 54 Republicans as well as some Democrats – enough to override a filibuster in the Senate. But the Keystone supporters do not have the 67 votes needed to overcome a presidential veto. Keystone supporters said the bill fast-tracking the Canadian pipeline was critical to keep crude oil moving. “We need more pipelines to move crude at the lowest cost and in the safest, most environmentally friendly way,” John Hoeven, the North Dakota Republican introducing the bill, told a press conference. “That means pipelines like the Keystone XL are in the vital national interest of our country.” TransCanada, the Canadian company building the pipeline, said it was encouraged by the moves in Congress. “We look forward to the debate and ultimately a decision by the US administration to build Keystone XL,” the company said in a statement. However, TransCanada said the administration had seriously delayed the approval process which, the company said, ordinarily took two years. “We are well over the six-year mark reviewing the final phase of Keystone with seemingly no end in sight. The bar continues to move again and again,” the company’s chief executive, Russ Girling, said in a statement. “It’s time to make a decision.” Campaigners see the bill as a first shot in a Republican onslaught against the Democratic president’s environmental agenda – from cutting smog to fighting climate change. “Rather than taking action to support clean energy investments that will spur innovation and create good paying jobs here at home, they have instead chosen to support the Keystone XL pipeline and the false promises made by its proponents,” said Tom Steyer, the green billionaire. Obama rejected Keystone in 2012, over its original route through Nebraska, and has opposed previous bills aimed at forcing through the project. In his remarks on Tuesday, Earnest did not say Obama would never authorise construction of the pipeline, and couched the planned veto of legislation expected to pass the House and Senate in procedural terms. Full evaluation of the project could not be completed until the final determination of the route of the pipeline, which is now with the Nebraska supreme court. “This is an important principle at stake here,” Earnest said, adding that the protocol for approving the pipeline had to be adhered to. He said it would be “premature” for Obama to authorise the pipeline before the court case and evaluation process had been completed. With Obama determined to use his veto, Republicans acknowledged on Tuesday it would still be a challenge to get the pipeline off the ground. Their most likely option now is to try to attach Keystone riders to other legislation that Obama would find it difficult to veto. A Senate energy committee hearing on the bill, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed. Republican leaders said it would take weeks before the bill is brought to a vote. The bill would bypass the State Department, which has authority over the Keystone project, and grant immediate approval to TransCanada Corporation to “construct, connect, operate, and maintain the pipeline”. The legislation faces delays from Republicans as well as Democrats pushing to attach various riders to the bill. Republicans were considering measures that would block or delay Obama’s plans to curb carbon pollution from power plants. Such provisions, it is thought, would be even more likely to incur a presidential veto. Democrats meanwhile were considering a number of potential riders of their own, including measures that would force the Canadian company building the pipeline to keep all of the oil that flows through it in the US and use only US steel in its construction, and another that would expand financial incentives for solar energy. With Democrats now holding only 46 votes in the Senate, however, these were unlikely to pass. The final outcome of the bill will almost certainly depend on whether Obama uses his veto power. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said repeatedly he intends to make Keystone the first order of business in the new Republican-controlled Congress. The project, designed to deliver up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the tar sands of Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast, has become a flash point for the broader debate about climate change. The pipeline has faced repeated delays since TransCanada first proposed it seven years ago. The State Department will not render its final decision until later this year, after the courts in Nebraska resolve a dispute over the pipeline’s route. The pipeline has been a recurring headache for the White House. Environmental campaigners say that if Obama is serious about climate change, he must block Keystone and stop Canada from expanding production of the oil from its tar sands that would flow through the pipeline, which is a far dirtier fuel source than conventional crude oil. The November attempt to force construction of the pipeline – a gamble by the Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu – saw a number of Democrats supporting the project but still came up one vote short of the 60 required. The defeat ended Landrieu’s hopes of hanging on to her seat in a run-off election. Republicans believe they have since picked up more votes from new senators such as West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito and Iowa’s Joni Ernst. But not even TransCanada officials believe there are the numbers in the Senate to overcome a presidential veto – should Obama decide to exercise that authority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/dec/22/2014-trends-cleantech-renewables-farm-factory-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-22T19:16:42Z","webTitle":"Top business sustainability trends of 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/22/2014-trends-cleantech-renewables-farm-factory-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/22/2014-trends-cleantech-renewables-farm-factory-waste","fields":{"headline":"Top business sustainability trends of 2014","bodyText":"It’s been a tough year for brand USA. There was a horrific torture report, police violence against blacks, a dysfunctional Congress – and a troubled middle class. Even our fun and games are not as much fun as they used to be: just look at the NFL and its dismal record on brain damage and domestic violence. In that context, corporate America had a good 2014. (Of course, in that context, just about everybody had a good 2014.) There was progress on the big issues that face big business, as well as the rest of us: climate change, food and forestry, labor rights in global supply chains and the circular economy. Corporates are stepping up to do their part. Collectively, they are not moving far enough and fast enough, but they are moving in the right direction. These days, that deserves two cheers, if not three. Among the year’s highlights: Climate change policies drive cleantech Here was one exception to the rule that the federal government can’t get much done. Using his executive authority, President Obama imposed strong rules limiting climate pollution from coal plants, then traveled to Beijing where he and Chinese President Xi Jinxing pledged to curb their nations’ greenhouse gas emissions, albeit not for a while. Their agreement led to the Lima Accord, a breakthrough in the sense that, for the first time, industrialized and emerging economies both promised to curb emissions. It’s unavoidably a voluntary approach to the climate crisis, and the emissions reductions that it generates may turn out to be too little too late. But as governments act, they will surely drive low-carbon innovation in rich and poor countries alike. That’s where business comes in. As the costs of wind and solar energy continue to fall, corporate purchasing of clean energy is reaching new heights, creating a virtuous cycle where demand drives scale, which lowers prices, which then spurs more demand. During Climate Week in September, companies including IKEA, Swiss Re, Mars and BT, organized by the Climate Group, launched RE100, an initiative to encourage big companies to use 100% renewable power. That week, too, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, currently the world’s most valuable company, took a strong stand in favor of climate action. No longer can the US Chamber of Commerce or the fossil fuel industry claim to speak for all of American business. One respected analyst, Shayle Kann of Greentech Media, says that by 2020, solar power will become cost competitive in more than half of the US, growing the solar market to 100 gigawatts—100 times larger than it is today. If it happens, that would be a game-changer. More companies pay attention to farming and forestry supply chains It’s no accident that big food companies like Unilever and Mars are sustainability leaders. Their global supply chains expose them to significant climate risks and resource constraints. Rising temperatures and falling water supplies, for example, threaten cacao growers in west Africa. So Mars is leading research to help farmers increase the quality and performance of cocoa plants, and better control pests and disease. Meanwhile, Unilever says all of its palm oil will be sustainably sourced by 2015. Retailers and food companies, meanwhile, are pushing sustainability programs down to the farm level. Walmart is working with 15 of its biggest suppliers to optimize fertilizer use and tilling practices in corn and soy farming. Field to Market, a broad coalition of growers, brands and retailers, is defining, measuring and advancing the sustainability of commodity crops. Under pressure from Oxfam America, General Mills and Kellogg promised to measure, publish and reduce emissions across their entire supply chains. Last fall, more than two dozen countries and as many companies also endorsed the New York Declaration on Forests, pledging to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030. A growing number of the world’s largest buyers of soy, palm oil and cattle have committed to exclude deforestation from their supply chains. Among them are such powerhouses as Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, once a target of activists, and Cargill, which sells $135bn worth of commodities a year. Factories get safer Every apparel company that did business in Bangladesh knew that factory conditions there were unsafe (and some had taken steps on their own to remedy problems), but it took the collapse of Rana Plaza, which killed approximately 1,100 workers in 2013, to spur the global garment industry to action. Since then, brands and retailers have organized a pair of coalitions – the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, backed primarily by European companies and labor unions, and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, a North American group – to inspect and, in some cases, remedy conditions at about 6,000 factories. Everyone involved in the effort says factories today are safer; no one will say they are safe enough. No one tragedy spurred competitors like Apple, Microsoft, Google and HP to form the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition, but they, too, have strengthened industry-wide efforts to audit suppliers to protect workers (and the environment) in the developing world. The circular economy grows The circular economy is the most exciting idea in corporate sustainability, and it’s spreading fast: companies are finding ways to take back, refurbish, reuse or recycle products that would otherwise be thrown away, creating a closed-loop, zero-waste circular system of production to replace the old-fashioned take-make-waste linear model. At Disney World, food waste is being converted into energy. Novelis is betting its future on recycled aluminum, although beverage companies have been slow to follow. Coffee waste is being turned into flour by an ex-Starbucks exec. “Don’t let fashion go to waste,” says H&amp;M, the global clothing retailer that takes backs clothes in all of its 3,100 stores. In a truly circular economy, powered by renewable energy, economic growth could be decoupled from environmental limits. It’s a safe bet that we won’t get there in 2015 or 2025 or even 2035.

Businesses, alongside governments and citizens, will lead the way towards a more equitable, sustainable future. Along with our UK and US counterparts, GSB Australia will investigate the social and environmental impact of business in Australia. To ensure we know about the most important sustainability issues, we asked Australia’s top thought leaders and change-makers in this area to form an advisory council. The members include Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, Climate Council’s Amanda McKenzie, Social Ventures Australia’s Michael Traill, Sustainable Business Australia’s Andrew Petersen, Diversity Council Australia’s Lisa Annese, WWF’s Dermot O’Gorman, 350.org’s Blair Palese, Greenpeace’s David Ritter, Beyond Zero Emissions’ Dr Stephen Bygrave, BLabs Australia’s Alicia Darvall, Australian Youth Climate Coalition’s Amelia Telford, Earth Hour’s Anna Rose, Do Something! Jon Dee, Professor Stuart White, the Director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures’ and Professor John Thwaites of Monash Sustainability Institute &amp; ClimateWorks Australia. We asked these members to nominate the issue they consider the most pressing. Here is a selection of their thoughts. ‘Start with cities’ Clover Moore, Lord Mayor, City of Sydney Our cities have become one of the crucial battlegrounds in the fight against climate change. They cover just 2% of the earth’s surface, but contain over half the world’s population – even more here in Australia – and cities generate 75% to 80% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. That’s why in Paris, city leaders will be part of the discussion for the first time at a UN climate conference. It’s vital we demonstrate the pivotal role cities can play in reducing global emissions. Our experience in Sydney is that you can deliver on ambitious emissions reductions targets without compromising economic growth. We have the most ambitious target of any Australian government – to cut emissions 70% by 2030, on 2006 levels – and we’re well on track. And those targets have been matched by strong growth and an unprecedented construction boom. Indeed 40% of new jobs in greater Sydney in the five years to 2012 were created in our local government area, and $3.9bn of new development was approved last year. Our Better Buildings Partnership brings together the owners of more than half of the city centre’s commercial-floor space in a group that works collaboratively to reduce emissions. So far, the program has reduced emissions in these buildings by 35%, reducing their energy bills by $30m a year. The City’s residential apartment plan, on the other hand, outlines a suite of simple measures to reduce the environmental impact of apartment living – applicable to over two thirds of the city’s population. And our climate adaptation strategy, which was prepared with help from major science groups and leading business and property organisations, contains 39 actions to deal with issues ranging from changing rainfall patterns and rising sea levels to more severe heat waves. The uncomfortable truth is that the slow response to this urgent threat means some climate change is now inevitable. But we must not waver from the common goal of limiting a global temperature rise to 2 degrees. Cities are where these national commitments will turn from words to action. ‘Divorce politics and coal’ David Ritter, CEO, Greenpeace Australia Almost 30 years since Paul Keating’s “Banana Republic” speech, Australia faces another vital moment of economic transformation arising from the greatest sustainability issue of our time. The coal industry – soon to be followed by oil and gas – must be swept into the dustbin of economic history. And clearly, things are rapidly changing. According to Goldman Sachs coal is in decline and will never come back. The collapse of coal is to be celebrated. Coal is the single largest global driver of climate change and the CO2 generated when Australian export coal is burned overseas is our biggest source of emissions. According to the Climate Council (pdf), 90% of Australia’s current coal reserves will need to be left in the ground if global warming is to be kept to no more than 2C. But the demise of coal raises profound questions around how we handle the change. It is essential that the transformation in our economy is managed justly and fairly. Good new jobs must be found for coal workers. Coal communities must be economically supported in transition. Genuine alternatives must be found for traditional owners who may have been relying on coal for revenue streams. Low-carbon economic alternatives must receive appropriate government support. But underlying all these practical measures must be an exercise in truth-telling. The Abbott government was particularly egregious in its ludicrous worship of coal as good for humanity. But no Australian state or federal government has as yet been honest with the Australian people and spoken the truth: that the days of coal are over. An absurd political charade persists; somehow Australia is going to have a coal industry and the world is going to tackle climate change. The problem is political economy. The fossil fuel mining industry has too much influence over Australian politics. Astonishingly, the Australian government still provides $1.8bn in production subsidies to the coal mining industry every year. According to the IMF, Australia provides fossil fuel subsidies equivalent to $1,712 per person per year, or around $40bn a year. Bizarrely, despite the downward spiral of coal, new mine proposals such as Carmichael and Shenhua Watermark, remain in play. The reign of coal is over. It is time for our political leaders to do their job and to call it and to bring on the reforms to match the necessary reality. ‘Transition away from fossil fuels’ Blair Palese, CEO, 350.org Australia The end of coal is not a radical, future idea but a reality already upon us. Scientists tell us that if we want a liveable planet in the future, we must keep 80% of fossil fuel reserves in the ground. That’s why Australia’s need for a rapid and well-planned transition from fossil fuels and out-of-date power plants to clean energy is our most critical sustainable development issue. It’s high time to end the divisive political rhetoric and to set a progressive action to make the move. As other countries have moved to rapidly take up renewable energy such as solar and wind, Australia has turned climate change into a political football and largely opted out. Despite being a solar energy dream nation, our entrenched leaders have ignored and even blocked renewable energy development and tied itself to polluting king coal. We are now a nation playing “catch up” in an industry experiencing exponential growth and evolution. This week the Climate Council of Australia released a report (pdf) showing that global clean energy investment has grown by 43% with 7.7m new jobs created in the industry worldwide, nearly doubling renewable energy job numbers since 2009. China’s renewable energy investments have increased by 32% from last year, adding 1.2m more jobs to their economy. In the US, investment is up by 8% and with a jump of 31,000 new jobs created since 2013. By comparison, Australia’s investment in renewable energy has dropped by 35% to its lowest level since 2009. Thank you Tony Abbott! Meanwhile, a new report by Barclays estimates that US$5.8tn will be wiped off the global coal trade by 2040 as the world addresses climate change. Australia’s Whitehaven Coal recently reported losses of A$343m and the company’s shares are down more than 80% in five years. If that doesn’t supercharge Malcolm Turnbull’s party to heed his call for innovation including renewable energy, nothing will. Australia needs to plan for the transition away from fossil fuels, especially coal and coal exports. The move toward clean energy is now our most critical environmental and economic issue. Our failure to do so is already impacting workers, communities and our economic opportunities in this rapidly emerging new global market. It’s time to turn that around. ‘Decarbonise the economy’ John Thwaites, chairman of Monash Sustainability Institute and ClimateWorks Australia Despite the significant global success in reducing poverty and improving health in the past 20 years, we can’t go on as we are. Global growth has come at the expense of unsustainable environmental degradation and potentially catastrophic climate change. The challenge for those leading sustainable development is to find ways to achieve economic prosperity and social opportunity for the world’s growing population, while protecting the environment from degradation that threatens human livelihood. This will require good planning, the right incentives, new technologies and behaviour change. Decoupling growth from resource use, pollution and climate change is possible. In Australia we have shown we can use water much more efficiently in irrigation and industry, boosting output while reducing water consumption. Our cities are now much more water–sensitive, and we are using far less water than we were. We can do even better with more recycling, stormwater harvesting and integrated water cycle management. However as one of the world’s worst per capita carbon polluters, we need to urgently decarbonise our economy. If global warming is to be kept below 2 degrees, Australia will need to be near net zero carbon pollution by the middle of the century. This will only be possible if we start now to implement the four steps to decarbonisation: energy efficiency, 100% renewable electricity, shifting fuels in transport and industry to low carbon electricity and planting forests to sequester carbon. ‘Create a diverse and sustainable workforce’ Lisa Annese, CEO, Diversity Council Australia Sustainability is usually related to natural resources, food supplies and energy. However, humans are a vital resource to the future of our planet, and like any other resource, it is important that we consider the workforce and the ways in which businesses manage people in a sustainable way. Having a sustainable business requires us not only to think about the way our companies impact on our environment, but also our impact on temployees, people working in our supply chains and the communities in which we operate. It also means thinking about our longer term human impact and whether we are contributing to a sustainable and, inclusive global economy. To ensure companies deliver the greatest social impact benefit, it is critical that organisations examine their workforce, and whether they attract and retain a diversity of people who can contribute fully. Happily for employers, there is also a strong business case to support diverse and inclusive workplaces, with well documented bottom line benefits. Research shows that diverse and inclusive workplaces are associated with improved job and team performance, greater innovation, productivity, profit and employee wellbeing and engagement. Too many organisations across the globe have yet to properly understand these benefits to their own business, in addition to the greater social good. Many still churn through their people, treating human resources as dispensable tools, and failing to recognise the consequences for broader society in unemployment, mental health impacts, substance abuse and poverty. Many groups in our society currently remain underrepresented and undervalued in the workplace including people with disability, Indigenous Australians, older workers, and those from culturally diverse backgrounds. Barriers to equal participation and more inclusive workplaces are still substantial for women and LGBTI Australians. And while we know that flexibility is a key enabler for a healthy and productive workforce, it is still out of reach for many employees. There is a lot to gain if we can change this picture. Better harnessing the full potential of the workforce can have significant economic benefits. For instance, it has been estimated that removing barriers to women’s workforce participation has the potential to increase the size of the Australian economy by about $25bn a year. And closing the gap in labour market participation and unemployment rates between people with and without disability by one-third would provide a $43bn increase to Australia’s GDP over a decade. It’s time for more businesses to step up to the plate. Overcoming the barriers to long-term workforce sustainability will require commitment, innovation, creativity and ingenuity. We need to get serious about diversity and inclusion by implementing robust strategies with measurable goals, and holding people accountable for achieving them. Until we do, we will continue to waste our greatest resource – people – to the detriment of individual businesses, our communities and our economy. ‘Use super funds for sustainability’ Michael Traill, founding chief executive of Social Ventures Australia and chair of Goodstart Early Learning. We have a pool of close to $2tn in superannuation funding in this country. How liberating would it be if we could think a little differently about how even small chunks of it could be allocated in ways that do not compromise the financial returns reasonably expected to sustain retirement incomes of fund members and contribute a sustainable social, environmental and productivity dividend to the nation? This is a real possibility, as a transaction like Goodstart Early Learning is demonstrating. In the case of Goodstart, $165m in capital was raised to acquire the bankrupted assets of the nation’s largest childcare chain, ABC Childcare centres. In the five years since the deal was closed, the initial investors received a 12% annual interest coupon and the debt provider, National Australia Bank, has had virtually all its debt repaid. This $850m revenue social enterprise is being run effectively with business disciplines for social purpose. The surpluses being generated in Goodstart are directly funding improved quality early learning across the network of 643 centres and targeting improved outcomes in postcodes of need. The model, thinking and capital structure behind Goodstart is entirely repeatable. If we think about the many sectors of the economy across spheres of education, aged care and health where there is a combination of revenue generation and a public policy imperative for high quality social purpose outcomes, Goodstart provides a precedent in demonstrating that both reasonable financial returns and high quality social purpose outcomes are possible. The Goodstart capital structure was predicated on contributions from private investors, the government and a traditional debt provider. If we can bring the most significant capital provider in the country – the masters of our $2tn in superannuation to allocate even 2% of the funding pool to such large scale opportunities - we would create a sustainable $40bn pool of impact investment.And we could help to change the country in the process. ‘Empower people’ Dr Stephen Bygrave, CEO, Beyond Zero Emissions Climate change is pervasive, cuts across all sectors, does not discriminate, affects rich and poor, all races of the world, both men and women and young and old, as well as all living species on Earth. It is the most urgent issue facing humanity. We are all deeply connected to this issue, but most importantly we are all part of the solution. With technical disruption and innovation occurring in almost every sector, individuals, households and communities are increasingly empowered to take climate action in the absence of any real commitment by national governments. Renewable energy is now cheaper than new coal and new gas, and with the price of solar power dropping a third over the past few years, Australian households continue to have one of the highest penetration rates of rooftop solar in the world. Battery storage is here, making the prospect of households generating their own energy and storing it 24/seven a reality. Autonomous and electric vehicles, as well as companies providing innovative car sharing arrangements, are shaking up the way we move ourselves around the landscape. With LED lighting, induction cookstoves, highly efficient electrical, heating and cooling appliances, as well as smart home energy management systems, our houses can be net generators of energy, not net consumers of energy. Energy retailers are becoming as much our customer as we are theirs. Every home can achieve energy freedom, empowered to be renewable energy powerhouses. Communities are embracing micro–grid technology, renewable energy community projects, electric bicycle networksand virtual net metering. Additionally farmers are revegetating, using zero or minimum tillage approaches, recycling nutrients and minimising the need for costly inputs such as fertilisers. This is the present and, increasingly, the future of climate action. Serious action on climate change will make for a more prosperous, more equal , cleaner and fairer world. Action on climate change is not a threat but a huge opportunity. ‘Transform the purpose of business’ Alicia Darvall, executive director, B Lab Australia &amp; New Zealand One of the greatest sustainability issues Australia faces is the drive for business to deliver return to its shareholders at any cost. The impact that rapid growth and profit focushas had on society, community and especially the environment in the last 50 years is detrimental. This drive for short-term gain at the cost of both our stewardship of the environment and social equality has lead to a loss of trust in our most powerful institutions. While business has all too often been a bad influence on our world, that is not always the case, nor does it have to be. We are beginning to see an evolution in business from a 20th century view that the purpose of business is to maximize value for shareholders to a shared view that the purpose of business is to maximize value for society. I believe our challenge is to create a generation of conscious consumers, employees and investors who make decisions based on the impact of a business on society and the environment not just price, salary and financial return. This in turn will create a cultural shift so that one day all companies compete to be Best for the World and society will enjoy a shared and durable prosperity."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/jun/21/catch-them-if-you-can-pragmatic-ways-to-cut-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"Catch them if you can: the pragmatic ways to cut carbon emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/21/catch-them-if-you-can-pragmatic-ways-to-cut-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jun/21/catch-them-if-you-can-pragmatic-ways-to-cut-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Catch them if you can: the pragmatic ways to cut carbon emissions","bodyText":"With an immense scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gases cause climate change, there is pressure to reduce carbon emissions, but little sign that governments can reach a binding agreement to cut back sufficiently. The answer may be a new material that is a thousand times more efficient at capturing carbon dioxide than trees. This substance, a synthetic resin, is a part of diverse attempts to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) practical. Mercedes Maroto-Valer, professor of sustainable energy engineering at Heriot-Watt University, defines CCS as “a portfolio of technologies that aim to separate carbon dioxide from other gases, then capture and store them in a permanent situation”. CCS is a pragmatic solution, recognising that we will continue to emit CO2, and so need to remove the gas from the atmosphere and store it away where it can do no harm. There are two primary strategies for capturing carbon dioxide. The natural mechanism is absorption by plants, which use CO2 to build their carbon-based structures, emitting oxygen as waste. Trees absorb a considerable amount of carbon and lock it away for much longer than smaller plants. However, trees take decades to reach a state when they absorb significant quantities of carbon. Trees, like the new resin, take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere wherever they are located. This makes for easy deployment, but limits the rate at which the gas can be removed. The alternative strategy is to take CO2 directly from the exhausts of power stations and carbon-intensive industries such as steel and concrete production, where the gas is much more concentrated. Maroto-Valer notes “these provide percentage levels rather than parts per million levels. A gas-fired power station might produce around 5% carbon dioxide and a coal fired station 10 to 12%.” Whatever the source, when the CO2 has been extracted, the most common storage technique is to pump it along a pipeline to be injected into an underground reservoir, often formed by layers of porous sandstone lying underneath shale, which helps keep the heavier-than-air gas in place. This process, called sequestration, which has undergone wide field studies, experimental verification and modelling should store carbon for millions of years. In other places, though, the suggestion is that the CO2 could be used to extract oil from dwindling reserves by pumping the gas into the well to maintain pressure. Unsurprisingly, this is considered a backward step by green groups. Mike Childs, head of policy for Friends of the Earth, said: “Places where [CCS] is being trialled are talking about taking the carbon dioxide captured and then injecting it into oil wells to extract more oil. It’s pretty nonsensical to try to address climate change by taking carbon out the atmosphere to try to get more oil out of the ground.” Capture processes come in three forms, pre- and post-combustion, and oxy-fuel. Pre-combustion converts fuel into hydrogen and CO2 before it is used. In principle it could produce highly efficient turbines, but as yet is the least tested option. Post-combustion is easiest to use with existing power plants and the only approach appropriate for collecting CO2 from industrial sources, while oxy-fuel is attractive for new purpose-built coal power plants, as it produces a particularly pure CO2 output and is flexible in operation, able to store energy by producing liquid oxygen during periods of low demand. In post-combustion, the exhaust gas is taken through a scrubber, where chemicals react with the carbon dioxide to produce a compound that can be moved as a solid or liquid before heating it to extract the pure CO2 for storage. However the new resin, the best so far of a number of such possible materials, is much simpler to use, as it is a passive absorber that sits in a flow of air, directly extracting the gas. The resin, developed at Arizona State University’s centre for negative carbon emissions, is an “ion-exchange” substance where positively charged ions in the resin attract and hold on to carbon dioxide molecules. Rather than requiring chemical reagents, the process is simply reversed by humidity. If the air is dry, the resin absorbs carbon; in humid air, CO2 is released. The downside is that the system will operate best in dry climates, though this doesn’t totally rule out use in the UK. Dr Klaus Lackner, director of the Arizona centre says: “My rule of thumb is that it will work if you can dry a towel on a clothes line. It’s a process that just like wind and solar energy will be affected by weather. So it would work in the UK, but not as well as Australia. But keep in mind that the air mixes well, so CO2 emitted in the UK can be collected in Australia.” A panel made up of layers of the material would collect between 10 and 50% of the carbon dioxide that passes through it – around a thousand times more efficient than the equivalent amount of CO2 collected by a tree in its lifetime. Each panel becomes saturated with carbon in about an hour, so a system based on this material would need continuous recycling of collectors, moving them to a humid location where the gas can be pumped away, then returning them to collect more. Like all CCS techniques there is an energy cost, which Lackner suggests will be 20-30% – similar to existing CCS technologies. While such imaginative schemes are at the early stages of development, conventional capture from power stations is further advanced. In the UK, three demonstration projections are planned – White Rose, a new coal-fired power plant in Yorkshire, Peterhead, retrofitting an existing gas-fired power plant with CCS in Aberdeenshire and a possible third plant at Grangemouth near Edinburgh. Each is a full-scale power plant intended to produce 380- 440 megawatts, able to power 500,000 to 650,000 homes while capturing around 90% of the carbon. These projects should come online around the end of the decade, but they have been beaten into action by Boundary Dam power station in Saskatchewan, Canada, the first major CCS installation worldwide, which went online in October 2014. Although smaller in scale, this rebuilt coal-fired station has already shown that it is practical to capture over 90% of carbon and is producing valuable data for future developments. The amount of energy used in the capture process reduces the efficiency of the station. The expectation had been that around 50MW of the 160MW total output would be used, but in practice only 40MW were lost, leaving 75% of output for consumers. Not even the most enthusiastic supporter of carbon capture and storage suggests that it should replace renewable sources like solar and wind, but renewables alone aren’t enough. Mike Childs says: “If we want to keep global warming to below two degrees we need to make very drastic reductions in carbon emissions. Given the situation at the moment it probably looks as though we will have to find some way of taking carbon out of the air and storing it. Now that can be tree planting, but it can also involving trying to capture carbon from the air and storing it underground. In terms of reducing emissions quickly, in some areas we probably need carbon capture and storage technology. Particularly, for example, steel or cement production. In energy, even with carbon capture and storage, emissions from coal-fired or gas-fired power plants would still be much higher than they are for renewable energy.” Dr Sarah Mander, research fellow at the Tyndall climate change research centre in the University of Manchester emphasises the need for CCS and the existence of a significant barrier to success: “If you think globally, coal and other fossil fuels will continue to be used for a long time… but political will has to be matched up by a policy regime to drive it… The world of CCS is full of a lot of people who want to make it happen, but ultimately there has to be money there.” Capturing carbon increases the cost of energy production, and someone has to pick up the bill. CCS has its detractors. Organisations that doubt the existence of manmade climate change regard it as a waste of money. Meanwhile, some green groups, while expressing support for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, feel that it provides an excuse to continue using energy sources they consider untenable. As Mike Childs puts it: “Whichever government had been elected, they would still see carbon capture and storage as an opportunity for UK economic development. Both parties want to keep fossil fuels as part of the energy mix.” The three British demonstration power plants are arguably required because fossil fuels will not be removed from the equation in the immediate future, whilethe potential to install similar collectors at industrial sites like steel plants reflects that even with carbon-free generation, CO2 would still be pumped into the atmosphere elsewhere. Meanwhile carbon reduction projects, perhaps using the new resin collectors, could enable us to deal with carbon from sources unsuited to direct CCS such as transport, and to address the reality that even if we stopped CO2 production tomorrow, levels are already too high. Carbon capture and storage has broad support, and is integral to the UK’s strategy to meet the 2050 emission reduction target. Progress is being made. As Mercedes Maroto-Valer remarks: “Compared to other technologies CCS is a relatively new kid on the block, and the others have subsidies. We are asking CCS to mature very quickly, and it has come a long way in only 10 to 15 years. And CCS is something we learn by doing.” Energy saver: Yorkshire’s new Rose The Drax power station in North Yorkshire was once the target of environmental demonstrations, but is now the planned home for a demonstrator CCS power station, White Rose, built from scratch to use the oxy-fuel process, capturing carbon dioxide to be pumped through a 90km National Grid pipeline for storage a kilometre beneath the seabed. The White Rose plant, operated by Capture Power, is expected to produce up to 448MW, which would support 650,000 households, with 90% of CO2 emissions captured, based on evidence from existing projects like Boundary Dam, a total of 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Although the plant could run on coal alone, the intention is to use around 15% biomass, material such as willow grown locally for burning, which would counter remaining emissions with the CO2 taken out of the atmosphere during growth. As well as providing energy and valuable data, White Rose would be the “anchor project” for the CO2 pipeline, which could carry a further 15m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Dr Leigh Hackett, CEO of Capture Power, said: “The Humber region is widely recognised, alongside Rotterdam, as representing the best opportunity for CCS development in the whole of Europe, given the proximity of secure North Sea storage sites and the high concentration of both power generation and industrial emitters in the region.” National Grid estimate that the planned site should hold more than 20 years of emissions. Begun in 2013, the project is in a final consultation and risk assessment phase. Assuming planning consent and funding, it is hoped that construction will begin in the first half of 2016, with the plant coming online in 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2014/apr/20/weatherwatch-global-warming-ocean-heat-trade-winds","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-20T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Like it or not, the future is hot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/apr/20/weatherwatch-global-warming-ocean-heat-trade-winds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2014/apr/20/weatherwatch-global-warming-ocean-heat-trade-winds","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Like it or not, the future is hot","bodyText":"Has global warming come to a halt? For the last decade or so the average global surface temperature has been stabilising at around 0.5°C above the long-term average. Can we all relax and assume global warming isn't going to be so bad after all? Unfortunately not. Instead we appear to be measuring the wrong thing. Doug McNeall and Matthew Palmer, both from the Met Office Hadley Centre in Exeter, have analysed climate simulations and shown that both ocean heat content and net radiation (at the top of the atmosphere) continue to rise, while surface temperature goes in fits and starts. \"In my view net radiation is the most fundamental measure of global warming since it directly represents the accumulation of excess solar energy in the Earth system,\" says Palmer, whose findings are published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. So why aren't surface temperatures keeping pace with ocean heat content and net radiation? The answer, according to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change, may be some unusually strong trade winds in the Pacific Ocean, which have buried the surface heat deep underwater, reducing the amount of heat flowing back into the atmosphere. Once the trade winds relax again that heat will likely be released and surface temperatures will bounce up again. In the meantime we'd be wise to keep a closer eye on ocean heat content (using the Argo array of ocean profiling floats) and net radiation (using satellites).

The 100% Renewable Energy's solar scorecard has ranked each House of Representatives member on various criteria, including their commitment to the renewable energy target, carbon pricing and support for large-scale solar projects. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Adam Bandt, the only Greens member in the lower house, came out on top, with full marks in each of the categories. Liberal Alby Schultz, who has called the renewable energy target \"the biggest government sponsored fraud in the history of our country\" came bottom of the rankings. The top half of the rankings are dominated by Labor MPs, with Graham Perrett, Julie Owens and former speaker Harry Jenkins all ranked as strong supporters of solar. However, there are exceptions. Four Liberals, headed by shadow communications minister Malcolm Turnbull, are ahead of environment minister Tony Burke, who is deemed to have uncertain support for large solar projects. Interestingly, in terms of electorates with the highest solar panel take-up rates, Wright, Mayo, Kingston, Grey and Fisher lead the way. Ironically, only one of these electorates has a Labor MP, with the rest presided over by Coalition members who are ranked lowly on the solar scorecard. 100% Renewable Energy said solar power in Australia has created 15,000 jobs, saved three million tonnes of CO2 and knocked $551.6 million off household power bills. However, Lindsay Soutar, national director of the advocacy group, said that many MPs were generally unaware of these benefits. \"Politicians realise that solar is popular with people, especially as the price of rooftop panels has come down, but the coal and gas industries still have a huge influence over them,\" she said. \"There isn't much understanding of solar among politicians. Many don't understand that a 1.5KW solar system for your roof costs $3000 now when it cost $12,000 just a few years ago. The price drop is significant.\" Russell Marsh, policy director at the Clean Energy Council, said he was confident that solar energy would continue to grow in Australia regardless of the federal election outcome in September. \"You can't say either side of politics treated it differently. The Coalition is very interested in rooftop solar and large-scale solar too and they have signed up to the 20% renewable energy target,\" he said. \"There's a common myth that household solar is installed by rich people and paid for by poor people. But when you look into it, you can see that the highest levels of take-up are in the mortgage belts with retirees. Those on lower incomes are benefitting from solar PV.\" \"You'd hope that as those individual MPs realise the benefits of solar in their electorates, their views may change.\" Despite a winding back of feed-in tariffs – the amount paid to solar households for generating energy for the grid – across Australia, around $8 billion has been invested in the domestic market on panels, encompassing 2.5 million people. Soutar said that misinformation about solar, and policy uncertainty around issues such as the carbon price and the renewable energy target, are holding back the sector. \"Politicians use solar schemes and the carbon price as a scapegoat for energy price rises when the independent evidence shows that most of the rise is driven by investment in poles and wires,\" she said. \"We know there are anti-renewable energy warriors in the Coalition and we are concerned what the position will be after the election. There needs to be policy certainty, especially around the support of the renewable energy target, or people won't invest on a large scale. \"Rooftop solar is popular in mortgage-belt marginal seats, as well as rural and regional Australia. But this doesn't correlate to political support. I can't understand why, for example, the Nationals don't support renewables far more, given the jobs and investment wind and solar can provide for those areas.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/oct/01/energy-efficient-air-conditioning-breakthrough","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-01T12:20:31Z","webTitle":"Energy efficient air conditioning is within sight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/01/energy-efficient-air-conditioning-breakthrough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/01/energy-efficient-air-conditioning-breakthrough","fields":{"headline":"Energy efficient air conditioning is within sight","bodyText":"If we are going to get global consumption of power on to a much more efficient basis, one of the challenges is air conditioning. Could we find a breakthrough that would cut 90% of the electricity required for space cooling? Air conditioners in use today work on the same principle as refrigerators, but instead of dumping the heat into the room (which is what happens at the back of a refrigerator) it is sent outdoors. Air conditioners use a lot of electricity because they involve repeated cycles of compressing a gas to a liquid, and that consumes power. In Singapore – a small, hot, developed country – about 30% of household power is used for air conditioning, and in commercial buildings it is 40%. Because much global economic development has happened, and will happen, in hot climates, the demand for air conditioning can be expected to increase markedly over the coming decade. There is a need for a much more energy efficient way to accomplish space cooling. The simplest thing to do is to refrain from excessively air conditioning a work or living space. A few degrees higher setting of the thermostat in those chilly restaurants, hotels, homes and offices would go a long way to saving energy. But what about the device itself? If the energy cost of compressing the gas back to a liquid is the critical step, is there any way to reduce or eliminate this? There is an old idea that is now being revived as a result of advances in chemical materials technology. Certain materials have a strong tendency to adsorb (that is bind to the surface) water vapour. When this happens, heat is released. Suppose that cool water vapour picks up heat from a hot room, and is then directed outside to where the adsorbing material is located. The water is trapped and the heat released to the atmosphere. To get the water back off the material, as cool vapour, only a small amount of heat needs to be applied to the solid. Ideally this would come from solar energy, or from some other source of waste heat. If neither is available, a small electric heater is required. Devices cooling air on this principle are known as adsorption chillers. The problem is that until recently the materials available at a reasonable cost, such as silica gel (the stuff in those little packets you get with various purchases, to keep them dry) do not trap very much water, so you need a lot of them to cool a space. The resulting adsorption chillers are large and heavy – and weight is a consideration for air conditioners, which are often placed on a roof. New materials are now being developed that are a step change in the amount of water they can hold. These materials are known as metal-organic framework (MOF) compounds. Some of the recent ones, developed by Dr Raya al Dadah at the University of Birmingham, at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, and at MIT in the US, will adsorb more than four times as much water as silica gel. As the name implies, these materials are made of various metals, such as zirconium or chromium, bound together with a loose web of carbon atoms, so that there is a much greater surface area with sites where water molecules can be bound. But the work of the chemists and engineers is not done. Many materials will work well for a few cycles of adsorption and its reverse, desorption. But a commercial adsorption chiller needs to keep up this performance for thousands of cycles without requiring a change of the MOF. The first materials are undergoing such tests, and if they succeed we might soon see commercial air conditioning using 10% of the energy required for today’s units.

Two years ago the number of people displaced by natural disasters tripled the number of war refugees. How can you see sky and not admit decay? This world isn’t a race to turn away from the ruins, whether family history or a whole country shatters against the tide, whether we keep our lives but lose our homes, we lose. HEH The problem of the climate change is not a country-specific problem, this is a worldwide problem. MR We had the Uttarakhand floods two-and-a-half years back where over 5,000 people lost their lives; we had unprecedented floods in Jammu in Kashmir, which hit the capital city of Srinagar. We had the earthquake in Nepal where over 10,000 people lost their lives. DW When I was growing up, we had a beach that is no longer swimmable because all the trees have fallen into the ocean, have been eaten up by the ocean. CW I live in Beijing so I literally experience smogs on a regular basis. It’s really bad, horrible, you get really worried about your own health, about your children’s health, everything like that, so there’s a sense of urgency overall in the society. JC The west actually has the bigger responsibility because the west is the larger polluter, is the larger emitter and is the most economically powerful bloc in the world. ST I think our hope is the globe shall be united and act together. JV My name is John Vidal, and I’m the environment editor for the Guardian. I’m here at COP 21 in Paris, and in this edition of the Global development podcast we’ll outline how the agreement could affect developing countries. Let’s put into context how far things have come since the last major COP, which was in 2009 in Copenhagen. Ed Miliband, you were the British environment secretary of state in Copenhagen. what are your experiences of climate change, your personal experiences? EM Well, I think we know so much more now than we did then about the fact that climate change is already here and happening, one degree of warming, clear linkages to extreme weather events that have happened, so I think compared to six years ago, when I was doing this as the climate change secretary, I think the imperative is even stronger than it was then. JV And now we’re in Paris for COP 21. So what has changed? EM The political will seems to be stronger, I think in particular China and America. I would say that what President Obama’s done in his second term and the focus of the Chinese has turned things quite significantly. AS I think the questions are not being tackled directly, so I think it’s cloudy like the weather. EA There’s just a lot going on, there’s a lot at stake, things are moving but not at the level that they should be moving at. MR2 Mary Robinson, I’m the special envoy to the secretary general on climate change and I also have my foundation on climate justice. The mood has changed a little bit and there’s a bit more of a sense that, yes, we can get an agreement and that it will be as ambitious as possible. And that’s a little bit different from the middle of last week, so I’m more hopeful but there’s still a lot of work to do. JV There is a sense that any agreement will always contain an inherent inequity between developed and developing countries. Meena Raman is from the Third World Network, an international NGO HQ’d in Malaysia. Now she’s been to many of these COPs, so I spoke to her in Paris. MR3 We know that the contributions that parties have put on the table at the moment don’t do that job fast enough. However, developing countries are making their effort and I think unlike Kyoto everybody is on board towards that process. But I think in order for it to be fair and just to the developing world, one of the most important concerns that they have raised is that it must recognise the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. JV Meena, that means that richer countries should really act further and faster than developing countries. Are we seeing this principle being dismantled here in Paris? MR3 Exactly. Now that seems to be the agenda of the rich, developed world. JV Small island states like Grenada in the Caribbean can not only get dwarfed in the negotiations but are also some of the nations right on the front line, suffering the most. DW My name is Dessima Williams and I come from Grenada, I’m an avid advocate for justice. JV And here in Paris you’re a delegate on your country’s delegation. DW That’s correct, and I’m also here in support of the work of Oxfam International. The way of life as we knew it, which was relatively stable and known, is no longer the case. Our agriculture, our tourism is at risk because 65% – 63%-65% – of all our physical infrastructure and, most of all, commercial activities are on the coast and that’s getting inundated with the sea. Our airport is at risk, it will go underwater if we have a metre rise. JV Do you think people here in Paris, especially from the rich countries, do you think they actually understand what is at stake? DW Over a hundred countries do, and that’s why we’ve asked for a maximum of 1.5C as a tolerable global average temperature so that we do not put ourselves at further risk. I think the more powerful countries, that larger physical mass, may not quite understand the immediacy of the threat and the impact of climate change to small islands, to coastal countries. And we have been fighting to get that message across for many years. I think it’s beginning to sink in a bit but the policymakers, some of them, still feel that there is time and space to manoeuvre because they have big economies, big land mass. Many countries in Africa, across Africa, the Pacific, the Caribbean, we have small economies that cannot continuously finance the destruction caused by climate change, neither do we have large land mass where people can in fact escape the ravages of the sea and the rains and so on. So I think we have an uphill battle to meet in the commons of justice. JV In Ethiopia they are also experiencing the effects of climate change. ST I’m Shiferaw Teklemariam, a minister in the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change in Ethiopia. In some parts of the nation we are already experiencing flooding, drought, the El Niño is causing a number of challenges, so the united globe has to act commonly on the problem, of course differentiated in the way we respond. So here justice, equity and also addressing your own genuine share towards climate change is what we are requiring. JV The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, was in Paris to attend COP, and also lead a meeting with activist Naomi Klein. So we asked him how he saw this inequity manifested. JC In the ability to represent, the ability to prepare, the ability to put forward technical arguments, because the west clearly has far greater resources than poorer countries in the world. JV The question is, should developing countries like Britain be setting stronger targets? Jeremy Corbyn. JC Much stronger targets, and we should abide by those targets and we should use all our influence here to get the strongest possible legally binding target and ensure that it is adhered to and carried out, and that the US in particular ratifies that target back in the Senate. So there has to be a proper climate change fund and $100bn being suggested is a good start, but I think we’re going to have to go further than that in order to deal with the levels of inequality. JV So what kind of agreement do most developing countries really need? HEH I am the minister of environment in Morocco and my name is Hakima El Haite. We are a developing country and we need help, we need transfer of technology, we need enhancement of capacity in some issues and some technologies. We need funds. JV What happens if the agreement is a weak agreement and not much gets sorted out? Is this very serious for Africa and for Morocco? HEH No, it’s serious for the world, sir, this is what all the industrial countries should understand, because if they want, and if we want around the world, to establish the balance of CO2 in the globe, the only chance is to let Africa and the G77 to develop in a different way. We are already suffering, you know, and we are already trying to adapt with our knowhow, limited knowhow. JV So how could developing countries address this gap? HEH I think that as Morocco we are a very nice model to the other countries, we have learned from our own experience that money is bringing in money, so if we have small public money we can attract investment and we can attract private sector partners, and this is very important to develop all the projects around the world, in Africa and elsewhere. EA Now, my hometown is still drying its feet as more poison bleeds overhead. They say it is sacrifice so we can live in comfort but what shelter can we find in disease? I’m Eunice Andrada, I’m a poet from the Philippines. I’m from a team of poets for the Global Call for Climate Action as part of their project called Spoken Word for the World. JV Most COPs feel pretty democratic and there are civil society groups from all over the world, and they make a lot of noise and they are lobbying their delegates at every point, this one feels slightly different, partly because of the atrocity in Paris and the security here is very, very high. Indigenous people have come from all over the globe – Africa, Latin America, even Europe. They came hoping for just one line to be in the final agreement; it has, however, been taken out. AS Alberto Saldamando, I’m with the Indigenous Environmental Network, who are devoting all of their energies to the creation of carbon markets and carbon offsets. And the object of the offsets are indigenous lands and territories – the forests, the lands – and we’re trying to protect them, or at least get something into the operative language that talks about respecting the observance of the rights of indigenous peoples. The Green Climate Fund, they funded a so-called risk programme in Peru which raises reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation of forests, and the idea is to increase the capacity of the forest to absorb carbon. Where they expect it to be absorbed are indigenous lands and indigenous forests, and there the market is going to say, “We own the trees, we own the carbon in the trees so you can’t touch them.” So, eventually, it’s going to affect their food security, we won’t be able to fell trees or clear fields. In fact, I talked to one guy who said that in his country, where he lives, they can’t even fish, they’re prohibited from fishing. So what are people supposed to do? JV We know now that indigenous rights will not be in this agreement; nevertheless, the Green Climate Fund was one of the great hopes for these talks. That will be the repository that will be a UN, effectively a bank, where all the money which is raised by the rich countries, the $100bn, will be put for different projects and then developing countries will apply to do projects for them. Now, it’s a battleground in itself because the rich countries want control of the money, they say it’s their money, they should control how it’s spent – and the developing countries say no, this is ours by right and we should decide how the money is spent. So it’s a huge battleground and it’s yet to be worked out. Issues like indigenous rights really just get relegated or dismissed completely but the one thing which is very much alive is renewable energy. CW My name is Changhua Wu, I’m the Greater China director of the Climate Group. The Climate Group has the international NGO headquarters in London, so I run the Greater China operations working in China. China, like many other parts of the world, has actually started to experience more and more extreme weathers and on a personal basis, of course, I live in Beijing and 2007 when there was huge flooding there were lives actually sacrificed in that process. I think China definitely has been advocating the energy efficiency, alternative energy development, and if you follow the Chinese president, Xi Jinping’s travel schedule this year you will find that he himself has already become the champion, the voice, the messenger of global sustainable development. Of course, there is China’s sustainable development there as well, and of course in November in Beijing at the Apec summit, you started to see President Xi Jinping and President Obama coming together, making joint announcements demonstrating the leadership and calling everyone to come on board and towards a low carbon future, that part has been unfolding in China, which is very exciting. JV Tata is one of the world’s biggest companies and in India; it’s gone very heavily into wind and to solar power. MR I’m Mukund Rajan, I work with the Tata Group. I’m a member of the group executive council with responsibility for our sustainability activities. We’re seeing the speed of natural calamities coming thick and fast, at a pace we’ve never seen before, and in each of these occasions we’ve tried to mount our rescue efforts, but we are now getting stretched ourselves. JV And meanwhile, there’s enormous air pollution in Indian cities, growth spurting ahead, desperate for more energy. MR Absolutely. I think a lot of people don’t realise that in India, given the size of our population, actually a very large number of people even today don’t have access to the electricity grid, over 300 million people by some estimates. And their energy needs, just to get to basic sustenance, is going to itself require a significant amount of investment, which is why we need to talk about what will be the path through which they access that electricity without making the same mistakes we’ve had to make in the past. JV But Tata, as I understand it, has got large interests in solar energy and also in wind energy. How will these be affected by this agreement, hopefully, which is made? MR The Indian prime minister’s actually recently announced a very major ambition, we are trying to navigate the international solar alliance of countries between the tropic of cancer, the tropic of capricorn, and his announcement suggests that India will now have an ambition to create at least a hundred gigawatts of solar power. JV That’s compared to what now? MR Minimal; it’s less than 10,000 megawatts in India at the moment. JV So this would be an immense achievement? MR This will be a gigantic leap forward, it’ll probably make India the world’s largest solar market. JV As far as solar goes, one of the most ambitious African countries is Morocco. It’s just launched the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant. Hakima El Haite again. HEH Morocco used to import and to be dependent on 97% of its energy from abroad, and it was very heavy on the budget of the state – and Morocco used to subsidise and to fund fossil fuels. Today, we have decided many years ago, ten years ago, to have this energy policy to produce clean energy with ambitions even to export this clean energy and, I’m really, as a Moroccan, very proud. DW So the work really escalates after we finish Paris, and that’s why Paris is so important because it gives us very strong and high ambitious parameters to go home and implement. JV Of the 196 countries who are here, 189 have already put in what they call intended nationally determined contributions, or INDCs. Now they’ve lodged these with the UN and each one is their country’s ambition, if the money’s available, what they will do. And, if you total them all up, what you see is there’s not enough to keep us under a two degree limit, which is what everybody wants, it’ll be something like 2.7 so there’s a long, long way to go, but it’s a very, very good start. DW The review of the global temperature goal has not been concluded, and I know a lot of developing countries will keep it on the table to show that the science is directing us to 1.5C. So the review is ongoing, the INDCs have to be acted upon, they have to be realised, we will agree here on a common metric and a common measure but in the case of the developing countries they have to have the technology and the capacity building to actually turn them into reality. JV This will be seen as a historic COP, one way or the other. It’s the result of 20 years of debate, it’s the culmination of a huge effort by the international community. But people say it’s really just the beginning and it’s what happens next that is key to the whole thing, whether it was worth it or not. Now we won’t know for many years because a lot of this stuff won’t kick in for five years at the very, very least but it will absolutely define our development paths, everybody’s, over the next 20, 30 years. EM The COP is not, in the end, the be all and end all, it’s what happens afterwards, because Copenhagen was very, very problematic in many respects, but it’s actually the work that’s gone on since that has if you like, turned things round and Paris is going to be more successful, I hope, but we’re going to need a lot more work in the days and weeks and months and years ahead. JV What is really noticeable is that everybody wants change, everybody can see here that we can’t go on in the same way. HEH I’m an optimist. Why? Because people are moving. Cities around the world are moving, the private sector is moving, NGOs are moving, territories are moving. JV This conference gives a little bit of a chance for that change to happen and that’s why people are optimistic, because they feel that it has been well overdue and countries have really got to start thinking in a very different way about how they all develop. JC We’ve then got to hold the governments that have agreed to it to those agreements, but above all to build for the next one and I think that the climate change march is a good sign that people are waking up to it. We don’t have to be afraid of the future, we have to be optimistic about it and be involved in it. All of our programmes are available on the Guardian’s website.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa’s Terra satellite captured this image of the snow-covered peaks of the Cantabrian mountains, the Pyrenees, the Alps, and Massif Central on 9 February 2015. Prince Patrick Island, Canada Prince Patrick Island, above, in the Canadian Arctic archipelago, is the western-most Elizabeth Island in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The island is underlain by sedimentary rocks, cut by still-active faults. The streams follow a dendritic drainage system: there are many contributing streams, which are joined together as the tributaries of the main river. Sea ice off western Alaska In the image above, snow and ice-covered land appear bright white while the floating sea ice appears a duller grayish-white. Snow over the land is drier and reflects more light back to the instrument, accounting for the very bright colour. The higher water content in ice over an ocean makes it appear duller, as does thinner ice. The ice-covered areas in this image, as well as the Beaufort Sea, to the north, are critical areas for the survival of the threatened ringed seal, that uses the sea ice to rear their young. In December 2014, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed that much of this region be set aside as critical, protected habitat for the ringed seal. Irrigation in the Arabian desert The agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia is growing quickly. However, surface water is very scarce on the Arabian peninsula, necessitating innovative solutions to water collection. This image shows how irrigation is applied in the Arabian desert. The bright green spots are centre-pivot irrigation fields, where water is drained from fossil reservoirs to ensure sufficient water for agricultural activities. The water is mined from depths of one kilometre, pumped to the surface and then distributed to the fields for irrigation. Eastern Canada at night Astronauts on the International Space Station took this panorama of the St Lawrence river in eastern Canada. The image shows Montreal as a major cluster of lights. The provincial capital, Quebec City (population 770,000), is visibly smaller than the Montreal metropolitan area (population 3.8 million). Low cloud over Ireland A high pressure system sitting over the North Atlantic Ocean just west of Ireland brought calm winds, that, along with a cold winter chill, made conditions ripe for fog to form. Fortifications on the Iran-Iraq border Astronauts on the International Space Station took this photograph of land fortifications along a 20-km (12-mile) stretch of the Iraq-Iran border, near the coast of the Persian Gulf. Systems of large curved earthworks, circular gun emplacements and straight connecting roads run parallel to the international border. First thought to be oil-pad installations, the strategic location of these formations along the international boundary made it easier to see these as patterns of military fortifications. This region of oil refining and exporting was the site of numerous military actions during the war in the 1980s, especially during the defence of the southern city of Basra. Musa Bay, Iran Before draining into the Persian Gulf, several rivers and streams in southern Iran converge into Musa Bay, a shallow estuary with a long history as a port. As far back as 326 BC a Greek navigator, Nearchos, noted that the area was already a shipping centre. Today it supports Bandar Imam Khomeini, Iran’s busiest port city. This striking view shows the dendritic branching pattern of the waterways that develops when streams move across relatively flat and uniform rock or over rock that resists erosion. The frozen United States The eastern half of the United States was trapped in a deep freeze for most of February 2015. Hundreds (maybe thousands) of records have been set for low temperatures and wave after wave of ice and snowstorms have hit the region. This image shows the US-Canadian border along the Niagara river. A manmade ice boom keeps the mouth of the river clear near Buffalo, New York. Chicago in winter European Space Agency astronaut, Samantha Cristoforetti, took this photograph of Chicago and posted it to social media on 19 February 2015 saying: “How do you like #Chicago dressed for winter?” Low clouds in central California Winter fog is common in California’s Central valley and can be so dense that it snarls traffic, causes fender-benders and can make symptoms worse in those with respiratory disease. At the same time, the moist fog helps keep temperatures low in the rich agricultural region by reflecting sunlight and keeping the ground from warming, which helps keep the abundant fruit and nut trees dormant, allowing for bountiful harvests. Scientific studies have reported that winter fogs are occurring less frequently in the Central valley. One study, by Dennis Baldocchi and Eric Waller, published in May 2014 found that since 1981 the number of foggy days between November and February has decreased by 46%. The severe drought that California has experienced in recent years may also have decreased the number of fog events even more since 2012. Bangladeshi mangroves Information on mangrove forest height can be used to estimate biomass, which is extremely important for climate studies and as an energy source in developing countries. This image of mangrove forest in Bangladesh is based on data from the German TanDEM-X satellite and Polarimetric InSAR techniques. Elephant Foot glacier, Greenland Pour batter on to a griddle and watch the mixture spread out into a round-shaped pancake. The movement is similar to the flow of piedmont glaciers, which form when ice spills from a steep valley on to a relatively flat plain. These glaciers are known for their nearly symmetric, fan-shaped lobes. The shape of Greenland’s Elephant Foot glacier, for example, is so distinct that it stands out dramatically from its surroundings when viewed from space. The Yellow Sea Remote sensing of ocean colour in the Yellow Sea can be a challenge. Phytoplankton, suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter colour the water while various types of aerosols modify those colours before they are seen by orbiting radiometers. Brussels This false-colour image shows Brussels, the capital of Belgium. Darker blue areas throughout the image depict thick vegetation, including the city parks and the large Sonian forest south of Brussels. Stretching over 4,400 hectares, the forest is home to animals including deer, red squirrel and wild boar. In the upper right is the city of Leuven in the Flemish region, home to the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev – the world’s largest brewing group that includes brands including Beck’s, Budweiser and Stella Artois. Dust storms in the western Sahara The Sahara is an arid, broad expanse featuring primarily sand and barren, hard, rocky plateaus. It stretches over most of northern Africa, covering parts of Tunisia, Niger, Morocco, Mauritania, western Sahara, Mali, Egypt, Libya, Chad, Sudan and Algeria. Dust storms are a major natural hazard, especially in spring, and February 2015 was especially active. Las Vegas and Lake Mead This image was taken over Nevada and Arizona in south-west US. Las Vegas with its grid-like urban plan is visible near the centre and the large dark area is Lake Mead. South-east of the city are large, dark shapes in one of the desert valleys. These are solar panels of a large-scale plant called Nevada Solar One. The plant harnesses enough energy to power an estimated 14,000 homes a year. Satellites can assist in the selection of sites of solar power plants by providing sunshine maps that combine information on overall solar irradiance and average cloudiness. Along with other space-derived products, including digital elevation models, this can help sustainable energy companies pinpoint areas best suited for exploiting solar energy. Heart of Voh, New Caledonia Mangrove swamps along the coast of New Caledonia in the south-west Pacific are pictured above in this false-colour satellite image. The heart-shaped formation – known as the Heart of Voh for its proximity to the Voh commune – is a natural structure caused by changes in vegetation cover. New land on Louisiana coast While most of the Mississippi delta plain is losing ground, new land is forming in Atchafalaya bay at the mouths of the Wax Lake Outlet and the Atchafalaya river. Geologists first noticed mud deposits building up in Atchafalaya bay in the 1950s, but new land first rose above the water line in 1973 after a severe flood. Since then, both deltas have grown considerably.

And, no doubt, despair from the put-upon Ecuadorians. After all, “soon” could mean anything – next week, next month, or even Christmas, now that he’s starting to look like a middle-aged Santa Claus. But there is one organisation that loves such uncertainty – bookmakers Paddy Power, which has been taking bets on when he will finally go. The favoured option – an attractive 2:1 – is September. A man’s life hanging in the balance: the perfect opportunity for a flutter. • The Church of England’s director of communications communicated himself into a corner last week, after a well-meaning but homophobic tweet about Vicky Beeching, the gospel singer who’s just come out as gay. The Rev Arun Arora tweeted that Vicky was welcome in church because “we are all broken”. In a cringe-inducing exchange with Kelvin Holdsworth, provost of St Mary’s Cathedral in Glasgow, @RevArun defended his comparison of Vicky’s sexuality to the brokenness of humanity. Holdsworth tweeted: “It would be racist to say that black people are welcome in church because all are broken. It is homophobic to suggest same re LGBT.” The the reverend went strangely quiet. • If you want to obtain a pass to enter the House of Commons, you’ll be required to tick yes or no to some pertinent questions on the application form, not least: “Have you ever been involved in espionage, terrorism, or sabotage?” Because, presumably, even for saboteur terrorist spies, lying on a form would be a step too far into the criminal underworld. At least the House of Commons doesn’t go quite as far as the US government, which asks visitors whether they have ever been involved in genocide. Naturally. But only once. • Jeremy Paxman has the best part of a year before he can start claiming his pension, so if he must joke that old people are “bloody everywhere” and that there should be a Dignitas clinic “on every street corner”, the time, undoubtedly, is now. In his standup show at Edinburgh, he said: “You will take Auntie Doris there and drop her off, and she will say, ‘See you next Tuesday’, and you’ll say, ‘Probably’.” The upsetting thing here is not that Paxo has called for the largely indiscriminate murder of our parents, grandparents and, well, himself. It’s that he broke the golden rule of comedy: don’t take someone else’s material. Martin Amis caused a similar outcry with the exact same joke in 2010, calling for euthanasia “booths” on street corners where old people can go into the great beyond with “a martini and a medal”. • Florida likes to call itself the sunshine state, so it is with something close to incredulity that we learn pro-coal lobbying groups there are blocking solar energy, making it as hard as possible for eco-conscious Floridians to install solar panels. Lots of pioneering solar power companies won’t go near the place, finding grey and wintry New York – where solar installations are now more numerous than taxi cabs – far more accommodating. Nor is Florida the only state in the south with a blind spot where solar power is concerned. South Carolina Energy &amp; Gas thwarted a move to install 80 solar panels on local churches and schools, and Virginia charges fees for the use of solar arrays. Maybe Alaska will prove more responsive. • There have still been no complaints about people taking selfies in the National Gallery, despite the art community’s outcry at the relaxation last week of its no-photography policy. Michael Savage, who writes the Grumpy Art Historian blog, doomily announced: “The last bastion of quiet contemplation is now to become selfie central.” Not to be outdone, the US media decided to press the selfie panic button too. Vice, the self-proclaimed “online den of nefarious activities”, raised the alarm with a piece entitled “Photos of people taking selfies at an art museum”. Four days since the end of art as we know it, no one at the National Gallery seems to have noticed. But we remain vigilant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-01T11:00:25Z","webTitle":"Generation Anthropocene: How humans have altered the planet for ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever","fields":{"headline":"Generation Anthropocene: How humans have altered the planet for ever","bodyText":"In 2003 the Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term solastalgia to mean a “form of psychic or existential distress caused by environmental change”. Albrecht was studying the effects of long-term drought and large-scale mining activity on communities in New South Wales, when he realised that no word existed to describe the unhappiness of people whose landscapes were being transformed about them by forces beyond their control. He proposed his new term to describe this distinctive kind of homesickness. Where the pain of nostalgia arises from moving away, the pain of solastalgia arises from staying put. Where the pain of nostalgia can be mitigated by return, the pain of solastalgia tends to be irreversible. Solastalgia is not a malady specific to the present – we might think of John Clare as a solastalgic poet, witnessing his native Northamptonshire countryside disrupted by enclosure in the 1810s – but it has flourished recently. “A worldwide increase in ecosystem distress syndromes,” wrote Albrecht, is “matched by a corresponding increase in human distress syndromes”. Solastalgia speaks of a modern uncanny, in which a familiar place is rendered unrecognisable by climate change or corporate action: the home become suddenly unhomely around its inhabitants. Albrecht’s coinage is part of an emerging lexis for what we are increasingly calling the “Anthropocene”: the new epoch of geological time in which human activity is considered such a powerful influence on the environment, climate and ecology of the planet that it will leave a long-term signature in the strata record. And what a signature it will be. We have bored 50m kilometres of holes in our search for oil. We remove mountain tops to get at the coal they contain. The oceans dance with billions of tiny plastic beads. Weaponry tests have dispersed artificial radionuclides globally. The burning of rainforests for monoculture production sends out killing smog-palls that settle into the sediment across entire countries. We have become titanic geological agents, our legacy legible for millennia to come. The idea of the Anthropocene asks hard questions of us. Temporally, it requires that we imagine ourselves inhabitants not just of a human lifetime or generation, but also of “deep time” – the dizzyingly profound eras of Earth history that extend both behind and ahead of the present. Politically, it lays bare some of the complex cross-weaves of vulnerability and culpability that exist between us and other species, as well as between humans now and humans to come. Conceptually, it warrants us to consider once again whether – in Fredric Jameson’s phrase – “the modernisation process is complete, and nature is gone for good”, leaving nothing but us. There are good reasons to be sceptical of the epitaphic impulse to declare “the end of nature”. There are also good reasons to be sceptical of the Anthropocene’s absolutism, the political presumptions it encodes, and the specific histories of power and violence that it masks. But the Anthropocene is a massively forceful concept, and as such it bears detailed thinking through. Though it has its origin in the Earth sciences and advanced computational technologies, its consequences have rippled across global culture during the last 15 years. Conservationists, environmentalists, policymakers, artists, activists, writers, historians, political and cultural theorists, as well as scientists and social scientists in many specialisms, are all responding to its implications. A Stanford University team has boldly proposed that – living as we are through the last years of one Earth epoch, and the birth of another – we belong to “Generation Anthropocene”. Literature and art are confronted with particular challenges by the idea of the Anthropocene. Old forms of representation are experiencing drastic new pressures and being tasked with daunting new responsibilities. How might a novel or a poem possibly account for our authorship of global-scale environmental change across millennia – let alone shape the nature of that change? The indifferent scale of the Anthropocene can induce a crushing sense of the cultural sphere’s impotence. Yet as the notion of a world beyond us has become difficult to sustain, so a need has grown for fresh vocabularies and narratives that might account for the kinds of relation and responsibility in which we find ourselves entangled. “Nature,” Raymond Williams famously wrote in Keywords (1976), “is perhaps the most complex word in the language.” Four decades on, there is no “perhaps” about it. Projects are presently under way around the world to gain the most basic of purchases on the Anthropocene – a lexis with which to reckon it. Cultural anthropologists in America have begun a glossary for what they call “an Anthropocene as yet unseen”, intended as a “resource” for confronting the “urgent concerns of the present moment”. There, familiar terms – petroleum, melt, distribution, dream – are made strange again, vested with new resilience or menace when viewed through the “global optic” of the Anthropocene. Last year I started the construction of a crowdsourced Anthropocene glossary called the “Desecration Phrasebook”, and in 2014 The Bureau of Linguistical Reality was founded “for the purpose of collecting, translating and creating a new vocabulary for the Anthropocene”. Albrecht’s solastalgia is one of the bureau’s terms, along with “stieg”, “apex-guilt” and “shadowtime”, the latter meaning “the sense of living in two or more orders of temporal scale simultaneously” – an acknowledgment of the out-of-jointness provoked by Anthropocene awareness. Many of these words are, clearly, ugly coinages for an ugly epoch. Taken in sum, they speak of our stuttering attempts to describe just what it is we have done. ❦ The word “Anthropocene” itself entered the Oxford English Dictionary surprisingly late, along with “selfie” and “upcycle”, in June 2014 – 15 years after it is generally agreed to have first been used in its popular sense. In 1999, at a conference in Mexico City on the Holocene – the Earth epoch we at present officially inhabit, beginning around 11,700 years ago – the Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen was struck by the inaccuracy of the Holocene designation. “I suddenly thought this was wrong,” he later recalled. “The world has changed too much. So I said, ‘No, we are in the Anthropocene.’ I just made the word up on the spur of the moment. But it seems to have stuck.” The following year, Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer – an American diatom specialist who had been using the term informally since the 1980s – jointly published an article proposing that the Anthropocene should be considered a new Earth epoch, on the grounds that “mankind will remain a major geological force for many millennia, maybe millions of years to come”. The scientific community took the Crutzen-Stoermer proposal seriously enough to submit it to the rigours of the stratigraphers. Stratigraphy is an awesomely stringent discipline. Stratigraphers are at once the archivists, monks and philosophers of the Earth sciences. Their specialism is the division of deep time into aeons, eras, periods, epochs and stages, and the establishment of temporal limits for those divisions and their subdivisions. Their bible is the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, the beautiful document that archives Earth history from the present back to the “informal” aeon of the Hadean, between 4bn and 4.6bn years ago (“informal” because vanishingly little is known about it). Being a geo-geek, I sometimes mutter the mnemonics of the ICS as I cycle to work, trying to get the sequences straight: Cows Often Sit Down Carefully. Perhaps Their Joints Creak? – Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous … The Anthropocene Working Group of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy – a title straight out of Gormenghast – was created in 2009. It was charged with delivering two recommendations: whether the Anthropocene should be formalised as an epoch and, if so, when it began. Among the baselines considered by the group have been the first recorded use of fire by hominins around 1.8m years ago, the dawn of agriculture around 8,000 years ago and the Industrial Revolution. The group’s report is due within months. Recent publications indicate that they will recommend the designation of the Anthropocene, and that the “stratigraphically optimal” temporal limit will be located somewhere in the mid-20th century. This places the start of the Anthropocene simultaneous with the start of the nuclear age. It also coincides with the so-called “Great Acceleration”, when massive increases occurred in population, carbon emissions, species invasions and extinctions, and when the production and discard of metals, concrete and plastics boomed. Plastics in particular are being taken as a key marker for the Anthropocene, giving rise to the inevitable nickname of the “Plasticene”. We currently produce around 100m tonnes of plastic globally each year. Because plastics are inert and difficult to degrade, some of this plastic material will find its way into the strata record. Among the future fossils of the Anthropocene, therefore, might be the trace forms not only of megafauna and nano-planktons, but also shampoo bottles and deodorant caps – the strata that contain them precisely dateable with reference to the product-design archives of multinationals. “What will survive of us is love”, wrote Philip Larkin. Wrong. What will survive of us is plastic – and lead-207, the stable isotope at the end of the uranium-235 decay chain. ❦ The Deutsches Museum in Munich is currently hosting “An Anthropocene Wunderkammer”, which it calls “the first major exhibition in the world” to take the Anthropocene as its theme. Among the exhibits is a remarkable work by the American writer and conservation biologist Julianne Lutz Warren, entitled “Hopes Echo”. It concerns the huia, an exquisite bird of New Zealand that was made extinct in the early 20th century due to habitat destruction, introduced predators and overhunting for its black and ivory tail feathers. The huia vanished before field-recording technologies existed, but a version of its song has survived by means of an eerie series of preservations: a sound fossil. In order to lure the birds to their snares, the Maori people learned to mimic the huia song. This mimicked song was passed down between generations, a practice that continued even after the huia was gone. In 1954 a pakeha (a European New Zealander) called RAL Bateley made a recording of a Maori man, Henare Hamana, whistling his imitation of the huia’s call. Warren’s exhibit makes Bateley’s crackly recording available, and her accompanying text unfolds the complexities of its sonic strata. It is, as Warren puts it, “a soundtrack of the sacred voices of extinct birds echoing in that of a dead man echoing out of a machine echoing through the world today”. The intellectual elegance of her work – and its exemplary quality as an Anthropocene-aware artefact – lies in its subtle tracing of the technological and imperial histories involved in a single extinction event and its residue. Anthropocene art is, unsurprisingly, obsessed with loss and disappearance. We are living through what is popularly known as the “sixth great extinction”. A third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction. A fifth of the globe’s 5,500 known mammals are classified as endangered, threatened or vulnerable. The current extinction rate for birds may be faster than any recorded across the 150m years of avian evolutionary history. We exist in an ongoing biodiversity crisis – but register that crisis, if at all, as an ambient hum of guilt, easily faded out. Like other unwholesome aspects of the Anthropocene, we mostly respond to mass extinction with stuplimity: the aesthetic experience in which astonishment is united with boredom, such that we overload on anxiety to the point of outrage-outage. Art and literature might, at their best, shock us out of the stuplime. Warren’s haunted study of the huia finds its own echo in the prose and poetry of Richard Skelton and Autumn Richardson. Their work – sometimes jointly authored – is minutely attentive to the specificities of the gone and the will-be-gone. Place names and plant names assume the status of chants or litanies: spectral taxa incanted as elegy, or as a means to conjure back. In Succession (2013), Skelton and Richardson studied palynological records to reconstruct lists of the grasses and flowers that flourished in the western Lake District after the end of the Pleistocene. The area “is still inhabited by the ghosts of lost flora and fauna”, writes Richardson, of which there are “traces that even now, centuries later, can be uncovered and celebrated”. Diagrams for the Summoning of Wolves (2015), a purely musical work, shifts from celebration to intervention: it is intended as a performative utterance – a series of notes, rituals and gestures that might somehow enable “the return itself”. Rory Gibb smartly notes that the work of Skelton and Richardson is different in kind from conventional eco-elegy: it evokes “a more feral feeling of being stalked by ecosystemic memory”. Such a feeling is appropriate to the Anthropocene, in which we have erased entire biomes and crashed whole ecosystems. Their writing often moves back through the Holocene and into its prior epochs, before sliding forwards to imaginary far futures. They send ghost emissaries – foxes, wolves, pollen grains, stones – back and forth along these deep-time lines. Instead of the intimacies and connections urged by conventional “green” literature, writing like this speaks of a darker ecological impulse, in which salvation and self-knowledge can no longer be found in a mountain peak or stooping falcon, and categories such as the picturesque or even the beautiful congeal into kitsch. ❦ Perhaps the greatest challenge posed to our imagination by the Anthropocene is its inhuman organisation as an event. If the Anthropocene can be said to “take place”, it does so across huge scales of space and vast spans of time, from nanometers to planets, and from picoseconds to aeons. It involves millions of different teleconnected agents, from methane molecules to rare earth metals to magnetic fields to smartphones to mosquitoes. Its energies are interactive, its properties emergent and its structures withdrawn. In 2010 Timothy Morton adopted the term hyperobject to denote some of the characteristic entities of the Anthropocene. Hyperobjects are “so massively distributed in time, space and dimensionality” that they defy our perception, let alone our comprehension. Among the examples Morton gives of hyperobjects are climate change, mass species extinction and radioactive plutonium. “In one sense [hyperobjects] are abstractions,” he notes, “in another they are ferociously, catastrophically real.” Creative non-fiction, and especially reportage, has adapted most quickly to this “distributed” aspect of the Anthropocene. Episodic in assembly and dispersed in geography, some outstanding recent non-fiction has proved able to map intricate patterns of environmental cause and effect, and in this way draw hyperobjects into at least partial visibility. Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History (2014) and her Field Notes from a Catastrophe (2006) are landmarks here, as is Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate (2014). In 2015 Gaia Vince published Adventures in the Anthropocene, perhaps the best book so far to trace the epoch’s impacts on the world’s poor, and the slow violence that climate change metes out to them. Last year also saw the publication of The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins, by the American anthropologist Anna Tsing. Tsing takes as her subject one of the “strangest commodity chains of our times”: that of the matsutake, supposedly the most valuable fungus in the world, which grows best in “human-disturbed forests”. Written in what she calls “a riot of short chapters, like the flushes of mushrooms that come up after rain”, Tsing’s book describes a contemporary “nature” that is hybrid and multiply interbound. Her ecosystems stretch from wood-wide webs of mycelia, through earthworms and pine roots, to logging trucks and hedge funds – as well as down into the flora of our own multispecies guts. Tsing’s account of nature thus overcomes what Jacques Rancière has called the “partition of the sensible”, by which he means the traditional division of matter into “life” and “not-life”. Like Skelton in his recent Beyond the Fell Wall (2015), and the poet Sean Borodale, Tsing is interested in a vibrant materialism that acknowledges the agency of stones, ores and atmospheres, as well as humans and other organisms. Tsing is also concerned with the possibility of what she calls “collaborative survival” in the Anthropocene-to-come. As Evans Calder Williams notes, the Anthropocene imagination “crawls with narratives of survival”, in which varying conditions of resource scarcity exist, and varying kinds of salvage are practised. Our contemporary appetite for environmental breakdown is colossal, tending to grotesque: from Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (2006) – now almost an Anthropocene ur-text – through films such as The Survivalist and the Mad Max franchise, to The Walking Dead and the Fallout video game series. The worst of this collapse culture is artistically crude and politically crass. The best is vigilant and provocative: Simon Ings’ Wolves (2014), for instance, James Bradley’s strange and gripping Clade (2015), or Paul Kingsnorth’s The Wake (2014), a post-apocalyptic novel set in the “blaec”, “brok” landscape of 11th-century England, that warns us not to defer our present crisis. I think also of Clare Vaye Watkins’s glittering Gold Fame Citrus (2015), which occurs in a drought-scorched American southwest and includes a field-guide to the neo-fauna of this dunescape: the “ouroboros rattlesnake”, the “Mojave ghost crab”. Such scarcity narratives unsettle what we might call the Holocene delusion on which growth economics is founded: of the Earth as an infinite body of matter, there for the incredible ultra-machine of capitalism to process, exploit and discard without heed of limit. Meanwhile, however, speculative novelists – Andy Weir in The Martian, Kim Stanley Robinson in Red Mars – foresee how we will overcome terrestrial shortages by turning to asteroid mining or the terra-forming of Mars. To misquote Fredric Jameson, it is easier to imagine the extraction of off-planet resources than it is to imagine the end of capitalism. The novel is the cultural form to which the Anthropocene arguably presents most difficulties, and most opportunities. Historically, the novel has been celebrated for its ability to represent human interiority: the skull-to-skull skip of free indirect style, or the vivid flow of stream-of-consciousness. But what use are such skills when addressing the enormity of this new epoch? Any Anthropocene-aware novel finds itself haunted by impersonal structures, and intimidated by the limits of individual agency. China Miéville’s 2011 short story “Covehithe” cleverly probes and parodies these anxieties. In a near-future Suffolk, animate oil rigs haul themselves out of the sea, before drilling down into the coastal strata to lay dozens of rig eggs. These techno-zombies prove impervious to military interventions: at last, all that humans can do is become spectators, snapping photos of the rigs and watching live feeds from remote cameras as they give birth – an Anthropocene Springwatch. Most memorable to me is Jeff VanderMeer’s 2014 novel, Annihilation. It describes an expedition into an apparently poisoned region known as Area X, in which relic human structures have been not just reclaimed but wilfully redesigned by a mutated nature. A specialist team is sent to survey the zone. They discover archive caches and topographically anomalous buildings including a “Tower” that descends into the earth rather than jutting from it. The Tower’s steps are covered in golden slime, and on its walls crawls a “rich greenlike moss” that inscribes letters and words on the masonry – before entering and authoring the bodies of the explorers themselves. It gradually becomes apparent that Area X, in all its weird wildness, is actively transforming the members of the expedition who have been sent to subdue it with science. As such, VanderMeer’s novel brilliantly reverses the hubris of the Anthropocene: instead of us leaving the world post-natural, it suggests, the world will leave us post-human. ❦ As the idea of the Anthropocene has surged in power, so its critics have grown in number and strength. Cultural and literary studies currently abound with Anthropocene titles: most from the left, and often bitingly critical of their subject. The last 12 months have seen the publication of Jedediah Purdy’s After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene, McKenzie Wark’s provocative Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene and the environmental historian Jason W Moore’s important Capitalism in the Web of Life. Last July the “revolutionary arts and letters quarterly” Salvage launched with an issue that included Daniel Hartley’s essay “Against the Anthropocene” and Miéville, superbly, on despair and environmental justice in the new epoch. Across these texts and others, three main objections recur: that the idea of the Anthropocene is arrogant, universalist and capitalist-technocratic. Arrogant, because the designation of the Anthropocene – the “New Age of Humans” – is our crowning act of self-mythologisation (we are the super-species, we the Prometheans, we have ended nature), and as such only embeds the narcissist delusions that have produced the current crisis. Universalist, because the Anthropocene assumes a generalised anthropos, whereby all humans are equally implicated and all equally affected. As Purdy, Miéville and Moore point out, “we” are not all in the Anthropocene together – the poor and the dispossessed are far more in it than others. “Wealthy countries,” writes Purdy, “create a global landscape of inequality in which the wealthy find their advantages multiplied … In this neoliberal Anthropocene, free contract within a global market launders inequality through voluntariness.” And capitalist-technocratic, because the dominant narrative of the Anthropocene has technology as its driver: recent Earth history reduced to a succession of inventions (fire, the combustion engine, the synthesis of plastic, nuclear weaponry). The monolithic concept bulk of this scientific Anthropocene can crush the subtleties out of both past and future, disregarding the roles of ideology, empire and political economy. Such a technocratic narrative will also tend to encourage technocratic solutions: geoengineering as a quick-fix for climate change, say, or the Anthropocene imagined as a pragmatic problem to be managed, such that “Anthropocene science” is translated smoothly into “Anthropocene policy” within existing structures of governance. Moore argues that the Anthropocene is not the geology of a species at all, but rather the geology of a system, capitalism – and as such should be rechristened the Capitalocene. There are signs that we will soon be exhausted by the Anthropocene: glutted by its ubiquity as a cultural shorthand, fatigued by its imprecisions, and enervated by its variant names – the “Anthrobscene”, the “Misanthropocene”, the “Lichenocene” (actually, that last one is mine). Perhaps the Anthropocene has already become an anthropomeme: punned and pimped into stuplimity, its presence in popular discourse often just a virtue signal that merely mandates the user to proceed with the work of consumption. I think, though, that the Anthropocene has administered – and will administer – a massive jolt to the imagination. Philosophically, it is a concept that does huge work both for us and on us. In its unsettlement of the entrenched binaries of modernity (nature and culture; object and subject), and its provocative alienation of familiar anthropocentric scales and times, it opens up rather than foreclosing progressive thought. What Christophe Bonneuil calls the “shock of the Anthropocene” is generating new political arguments, new modes of behaviour, new narratives, new languages and new creative forms. It asserts – as Jeremy Davies writes at the end of his excellent forthcoming book, The Birth of the Anthropocene – a “pressing need to re-imagine human and nonhuman life outside the confines of the Holocene”, while also asking “how best to keep faith with the web of relationships, dependencies, and symbioses that made up the planetary system of the dying epoch”. Systemic in its structure, the Anthropocene charges us with systemic change. ❦ In 1981 the research field of “nuclear semiotics” was born. A group of interdisciplinary experts was tasked with preventing future humans from intruding on to a subterranean storage facility for radioactive waste, then under construction in the New Mexico desert. The half-life of plutonium-239 is around 24,100 years; the written history of humanity is around 5,000 years old. The challenge facing the group was how to devise a sign system that could semantically survive even catastrophic phases of planetary future, and that could communicate with an unknown humanoid-to-be. Several proposals involved forms of hostile architecture: a “landscape of thorns” in which 15m-high concrete pillars with jutting side spikes impeded access; a maze of sharp black rock blocks that absorbed solar energy to become impassably hot. But such aggressive structures can act as enticements rather than cautions, suggesting here be treasure rather than here be dragons. Prince Charming hacked his way through the briars to wake Sleeping Beauty. Indiana Jones braved wooden spikes and rolling boulders to reach the golden idol in a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Sometimes I wonder if the design task should be handed wholesale to the team behind the Ikea instruction manuals: if they can convey in pictograms how to put up a Billy bookcase anywhere in the world, they can surely tell someone in 10,000 years’ time not to dig in a certain place. The New Mexico facility is due to be sealed in 2038. The present plans for marking the site involve a berm with a core of salt, enclosing the above-ground footprint of the repository. Buried in the berm will be radar reflectors, magnets and a “Storage Room”, constructed around a stone slab too big to be removed via the chamber entrance. Data will be inscribed on to the slab including maps, time lines, and scientific details of the waste and its risks, written in all current official UN languages, and in Navajo: “This site was known as the WIPP (Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Site) when it was closed in 2038 AD … Do not expose this room unless the information centre messages are lost. Leave the room buried for future generations.” Discs made of ceramic, clay, glass and metal, also engraved with warnings, will be embedded in the soil and the shaft seals. Finally, a “hot cell”, or radiation containment chamber, will be constructed: a reinforced concrete structure extending 60 feet above the earth and 30 feet down into it: VanderMeer’s “Tower” made real. I think of that configuration of berm, chamber, shaft, disc and hot cell – all set atop the casks of pulsing radioactive molecules entombed deep in the Permian strata – as perhaps our purest Anthropocene architecture. And I think of those multiply repeated incantations – pitched somewhere between confession, caution and black mass; leave the room buried for future generations, leave the room buried for future generations … – as perhaps our most perfected Anthropocene text. • This article was amended on 6 April 2016 to correct the name of Henare Hamana."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2014/may/22/burning-answer-solar-revolution-keith-barnham-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-22T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"The Burning Answer: a User's Guide to the Solar Revolution by Keith Barnham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/22/burning-answer-solar-revolution-keith-barnham-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/may/22/burning-answer-solar-revolution-keith-barnham-review","fields":{"headline":"The Burning Answer: a User's Guide to the Solar Revolution by Keith Barnham","bodyText":"Is there anything new to add to a debate that seems to have reached stalemate? The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has spoken again, but does anyone expect government policies or public opinion to change much as a result? Fortunately, Keith Barnham does have something new to say: he cuts through the current morass of fossil-fuel and nuclear lobbyists' negative propaganda with a clear and original vision for solar power. He begins with Einstein's two great equations from 1905 and traces the consequences that led to our present impasse. You already know one of them, but the other, simpler equation, describing the interconvertibility of light and electricity (the photoelectric effect), is the equation that led to the silicon solar cell. Barnham argues that E = mc² is Bad and E = hf is Good. Despite their level-pegging in 1905, these two equations produced results at very different rates: nuclear research led to the atomic bomb inside 40 years, with nuclear-powered electricity a decade later. The first the world knew of the photoelectric effect was the photocell-operated automatic door, patented in 1959 and emphatically not the stuff of Manhattan Projects; silicon solar cells first powered a calculator in 1978. Barnham finds it hugely significant that the US and Britain, the nations that principally developed nuclear technology, lag behind the world in renewable solar energy, whereas the leaders in the field are the three defeated nations of the second world war: Germany, Japan and Italy, all of which were barred from developing nuclear weapons. He cites many instances of British governmental prejudice in favour of nuclear energy, despite a history of technical and commercial failures. Barnham is a leading researcher and developer of silicon solar cells and, for a while, his team held the world record for the most efficient version of this rapidly improving technology. He is not an ivory-tower scientist and has worked to commercialise his discoveries – but he has come up against the chronic failure of British industry and finance to nurture such innovative technology. He has a conceit to make the point about solar versus fossil and nuclear fuels. Imagine there really are more advanced civilisations in the universe than ours: the reason we've never heard from them is that they've taken one look at earth, where we are still burning fossil fuels and uranium instead of using solar power, and decided that \"earthlings are too stupid to be worth colonising\". Propagandists for fossil fuels and nuclear power have tried to discredit renewable energy with lazy, superficially plausible objections: in a country like Britain there's not sufficient sun, the wind doesn't always blow, and so on. But, as with all science, common sense is a poor guide. Barnham demonstrates that even in northern countries there is quite enough renewable energy available. Indeed, the Scandinavian countries plus Germany are the leaders in renewables, with Iceland (geothermal) and Norway (hydroelectric) close to 100% in renewable electricity generation. If they can do it, so can Britain. Barnham proposes a combination of technologies. As a leading photovoltaic solar cell inventor, he gives this pride of place, along with onshore wind, biogas from waste food and underground heat pumps. The last two are the least familiar but perhaps most promising for filling the gaps when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. In Sweden more than 90% of new homes have ground source heat pumps installed: just two metres down the ground retains sufficient warmth to provide hot water for a house via reverse refrigeration technology. Biogas technology puts to use the methane from household waste. Instead of adding to global warming by dumping waste in landfill (methane is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2) it can be used either to supplement natural gas to generate electricity or for domestic heating and cooking. Perhaps the most important of all Barnham's correctives to the received wisdom on energy sources is his stress on developing biofuels from the very CO2 that is tipping the world's climate into the danger zone. Carbon dioxide is the source of all living plant material (biomass) and fossil fuels. The best-known technology for reducing CO2 emissions at source is carbon capture and storage, but why pay to bury it when it could be put to use? To do this we have to learn what every leaf knows: how to turn sunlight, CO2 and water into biomass. The race to mimic nature's two photosystems is the greatest scientific challenge of our time, the Manhattan Project and the Moonshot rolled into one: far more important in fact but not necessarily more expensive or more demanding of resources or ingenuity. Unravelling nature's mechanism is almost complete – an achievement arguably as great as DNA sequencing but, astonishingly, so far unknown to almost everyone. One of the pioneers is Barnham's colleague at Imperial College, James Barber. Photosystem II, which Barber revealed, is almost unbelievably complex. But that's because it evolved: we will be able to simplify it. Nature has to make sugar as the universal fuel, but we only need to make methanol to get the wheels of industry turning and to start the chemical synthesis chains. Labs all over the world are racing towards the goal of artificial photosynthesis to produce economically viable biofuel from CO2; this will certainly be achieved, despite the many hurdles thrown in the way by uncomprehending governments and malign lobbies. Besides urging the adoption of this ambitious solar project, Barnham also has sound practical advice for consumers wanting to install renewables at home: ground storage as well as solar panels. The vision is clear: making energy from CO2 solves two problems at once. It transforms CO2 from the problem to the solution. And this will change everything. When we can produce biomass from CO2 and sunlight we will have options on what to do with it. Unlike the electricity from solar cells it is stored solar energy, to use when and where we choose. Besides producing our energy, plastics, drugs, paints and so forth from it, we will be able to control to some extent how much of it re-enters the atmosphere as CO2. Solid matter is easier to sequester than gas. It is a bold vision, a necessary one, and the world needs to be fired up about it. Keith Barnham is fanning a necessary flame. • Peter Forbes is the author, with Tom Grimsey, of Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal.

He’s reeling; his attempt to stop the sometime friendly fire from conservatives by suing Jones for defamation smacks of desperation. It’s a tactic from a nastier age, one beloved of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose litany of taxpayer-funded defamation actions against opposition members was legendary. Having cried foul over a non-existent Labor smear campaign, Newman then bizarrely accused Labor of accepting bikie donations. Challenged to provide evidence, he told the press to “google it”. And his robotic repetition of “strong jobs, strong team, strong plan” in response to questions on Monday didn’t right things. Enthusiasm for the premier at a business fundraiser on Wednesday was lukewarm, to say the least. It was probably unhelpful that during the campaign the electorate were reminded of the reason Newman was there in the first place: his reputation as a socially liberal Brisbane mayor who could get things done. A video surfaced showing Campbell touting the virtues of solar energy and pointing out, reasonably, that Queensland couldn’t always rely on coal. This from a man whose first acts as premier included the cancellation of what was to be Australia’s largest renewable energy project at Chinchilla. That was little noticed at the time, overshadowed by the LNP’s swipe at the yartz – the canning of the Queensland premier’s literary awards. Captured by the active forces of the religious right within the LNP, the then-candidate for Ashgrove, despite his proclaimed support for same-sex marriage, had also spent the 2012 campaign equivocating over the Labor government’s civil unions legislation. Newman reiterated his support for same-sex marriage in the leaders’ forum last week, but offered this as a very personal opinion, not his party’s position. The socially liberal, “progressive” Newman has gone missing in action, occluded by a somewhat paranoid political figure obsessed constantly at lashing out at enemies. Perhaps he just couldn’t translate his “Can Do” mayoral style into the bigger theatre of state politics, or perhaps as a politician who had never faced real opposition in his council campaigns, he took it far too personally. For whatever reason, and personality must play a part, Newman as premier presented a very different figure to the relatively relaxed and urbane Brisbane mayor. This isn’t necessarily paradoxical when viewed through the history of parties of the right in the Sunshine State, which buck the truism that they maintain their unity and cohesion more from being against Labor and the union movement. Queensland’s conservatives are different: in a state where capital always came from elsewhere, where Brisbane was a “branch office town” and where the legal and medical establishments were left to fly the “small l” liberal flag more or less on their lonesome, the state had never been fertile soil for social liberalism. It’s often not realised that Queensland in the 1970s and 1980s had something more akin to a three-party system than a straight fight between Labor and the Coalition. The Coalition between the Libs and Nats was even shakier in Queensland than in other states – with the Liberals often putting up little more than a “ginger group” in parliament concerned to speak up for accountability, due process and often, the environment. Led informally by Terry White and then Angus Innes, both urban professionals who would lead the decimated party Joh left behind in 1983, the “trendies” were always in a state of extreme tension with the state of authoritarianism favoured by the Nationals under Joh. Political scientist Paul Reynolds’s biography of post-Joh premier Mike Ahern reveals periodic secret deals between Labor and the Nationals to marginalise the Libs, and between the Libs and Labor to chip away at the Nats’ dominance. So, elections were more often than not fights between the Liberals and Nationals, after the party reinvented itself to appeal more broadly outside the bush. The Labor Party was sometimes trapped in the headlights, more spectator of the internecine warfare between the governing parties than contender for government itself. This changed in 1983, when the Nats gained power in their own right, grabbing a swathe of urban seats, often ones with a strong fundamentalist Christian presence. The Fitzgerald inquiry and Labor’s victory under Wayne Goss brought this creaky edifice crashing down, reducing the Liberals to a tiny party of the Gold and Sunshine coasts. Unsurprisingly, both the Nationals and Liberals were plagued by leadership tensions. The “NSW disease” of revolving door leaders was actually a Queensland disorder before it ever infected politics south of the Tweed. By 2008, when the LNP was formed, the “small l” liberals were but a memory, and it was up to the once and future federal MP Mal Brough to try to save a separate Liberal party. Enter, not without controversy, Campbell Newman. While his concrete achievements, critics often pointed out, were limited to seemingly endless tunnels no one drove through, his “can do” image and social liberalism were just the trick for detaching Brisbane voters from an uncertain Labor faith. Brisbane mayors have long been major figures on the urban horizon. Clem Jones sewered the suburbs and built the freeways, Sallyanne Atkinson ushered in Expo 88, Jim Soorley launched CityCats on the river and renewed the inner city. Newman, although often perceived as being too close to developers, had nevertheless made much of his commitment to climate change and to green space, and introduced a bicycle rental scheme, not so good in execution, but definitely representing a modern vision for the city. So too did the Newman administration at City Hall support iconic arts projects such as the Gallery of Modern Art. In truth, whatever the premier’s intentions, power is still wielded largely by the LNP party administration, a very country affair, prepared to overturn the parliamentary leadership on preselections. Newman was always cursed to live in interesting times, with a fractious backbench in a bloated parliamentary party coming back to haunt him, and his back watched by deputy premier Jeff Seeney – described by one of his own Nationals colleagues as “the most hated man in the bush”. Whether it was the youthful zeal of attorney general Jarrod Bleijie (an invisible man in the campaign), the lure of Palmer and Katter for disillusioned backbenchers, the necessity of keeping the religious right in the sheepfold, or just the governing traditions of the Queensland right (“development”, “private enterprise”, “strong leadership”), Newman reverted to type. He recast himself in the mould of premiers past: war declared on just about everyone, legislation rushed through with little consultation and in record time, process held in contempt, and enemies targeted. His “Operation Boring” has stalled and then spluttered back into life, with allegations of cronyism around coal and coal seam gas developments dominating the airwaves. That Newman resorted to the Bjelke-Petersen tactic of trying to silence dissent through lawsuit suggests he is a prisoner of the past, not just of whatever transpired between him and Alan Jones (a topic on which I think it’s wise to make no comment) – but also on the colourful and tawdry traditions of the right in the Sovereign Sunshine State. So it’s not surprising that the latest polls show the premier in danger, real danger, of losing his own seat of Ashgrove, itself home to many green-minded citizens and many, many public servants. Whatever the future of the LNP, in the event of a narrow loss, a hung parliament or even a Labor victory (looking more plausible according to the most recent polls), it can’t be back to the bush. Somehow, the party will need to find a way of accommodating both urban and rural voters within the one tent. And that might mean a leader less captive of, and subservient to the party’s various factions and power structures than Campbell Newman has proved to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"cities/2014/jun/09/dallas-texas-new-cities-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-09T11:03:33Z","webTitle":"Can Dallas, Texas ride the New Cities Summit towards a new self-image?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/09/dallas-texas-new-cities-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2014/jun/09/dallas-texas-new-cities-summit","fields":{"headline":"Can Dallas, Texas ride the New Cities Summit towards a new self-image?","bodyText":"We've been cheering along the competition to find the best urban app. At last, as the third incarnation of the New Cities Summit kicks off in eight days' time, that contest will end in victory for one of the three finalists: the ride-share service Djump, the biking app Social Cyclist or the borrowing-from-the-neighbours tool Peerby. The summit isn't just about apps, though. Ninety-odd speakers, including mayors of cities in Africa, Asia and Europe, as well as starry academics, corporate reps and more, will gather over three days (17-19 June) in Dallas, Texas. One strand we're particularly looking forward to, a hit of previous events, is WhatWorks. This is a miniseries of 10 speakers discussing their urban innovations, across sectors such as farming, crime, waste, energy and design. One example is NextDrop, an app that monitors urban water distribution from source to tap, in order to minimise shortages. There's also Strawberry Tree, a public solar charger for mobile devices. Its creators call it a \"piece of green urban furniture\", and it acts as a Wi-Fi station and phone recharger, using solar energy stored in batteries to feed out juice regardless of the weather or time of day. Dallas will hope the summit dispels any remnants of its 80s reputation for big hair and shoulder pads (just as they're becoming fashionable again, too) and underlines its ambitions as a cultural and technological hub. The mayors of Dallas and Fort Worth – two urban districts that combine to form the fourth-largest in the US – will both be holding court, and the summit is being staged at the Winspear Opera House, part of a 20-square-block area of cultural venues known as the Dallas Arts District. Blogs such as Patrick Kennedy's award-winning Car Free in Big D (part of the Guardian Cities network of city bloggers) have been banging on about reinventing Dallas for years. But with Austin seemingly in firm control of the Texas heavyweight title for arts, all eyes will be on whether the New Cities Summit's subtitle – Re-imagining Cities: Transforming the 21st Century Metropolis – applies first and foremost to the host city itself. During the summit, Guardian Cities will be chairing the Shared City workshop on Tuesday 17 June, which – considering the current controversy surrounding Uber and Airbnb – ought to be a good ol' rodeo. Molly Turner, Airbnb’s director of public policy, is on the panel, along with the likes of Michael Dixon, general manager of IBM’s Smarter Cities, and Corey Zehngebot, senior urban designer at the Boston Redevelopment Authority. We’d be delighted to feed your thoughts, concerns and criticisms about how we share our cities into the discussion: is the burgeoning “sharing movement” a success, a scam, or both?

While it may be an unfamiliar concept for many engaged in local grassroots businesses they can nevertheless see the potential of engaging in ventures which have a social impact. According to the Opportunity Pakistan Report – produced by i-genius, an initiative supporting social entrepreneurs worldwide – despite the country’s social and political unrest, it offers opportunities for investment and innovation. “Countries experiencing transition are fertile places for new ideas to thrive”, said Shivang Patel, commission coordinator of i-genius. “Despite media attention in the west on all things bad in the region we found a country progressing through slow but significant positive reforms. There is considerable untapped potential for social businesses”. A new wave of creative and confident young entrepreneurs has emerged developing innovative start ups in areas such as environment, health and skills. Scores of young women and men from remote areas of Pakistan are becoming social entrepreneurs. A longstanding lack of investment in Pakistan’s public sector has prompted local business leaders to invest in ideas which tackle issues such as water and sanitation problems as well as those which can address its energy and environmental concerns. Water One such example is Pharmagen Water. Established in 2007, it aims to provide poor communities in Pakistan’s second largest city, Lahore, with affordable clean and purified drinking water. It is supported by the Acumen, which invests in entrepreneurs and creates venture capital which can provide solutions to causes of poverty. “We have set up a chain of 17 shops at various less affluent areas of Lahore through which we are servicing 250,000 underprivileged people,” said the company’s CEO Parvez Sufi. “Our water is purified with balanced minerals which is made using state of the art reverse osmosis purification process on international lines in accordance with the World Health Organisation standard”. Energy Another business offering a solution to parts of Pakistan’s energy strapped areas is SRE Solutions. Established just last year with Acumen’s support it offers to harness solar energy for off-grid customers in districts of Punjab and Khayber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Sophia Ahmed, business associate of Acumen’s arm in Pakistan explains, “Its solutions range from 5W-100W, integrating imported Chinese solar panels with DC based imported bulbs and fans. They offer a viable alternative to kerosene oil based lanterns currently being used in most of the remote off grid rural communities.” Construction Similarly a low-cost engineering and construction enterprise, Ghonsla, was set up in the aftermath of Pakistan’s devastating earthquake in 2005. With 73,000 people killed and large parts of its cities and villages destroyed in the north by the disaster, the plight of 2.5 million people left homeless hung in the balance. While carrying out field work during this time Zehra Ali, the company’s founder, saw a demand for sustainable, greener insulation for the housing solutions being offered to those affected by the earthquake. “Since our product is linked directly with making people’s homes more comfortable in the winter and reducing consumption of fuel wood, it provided a part of the solution to reducing indoor smoke,” Ali explained. In the coming months she is looking into increasing production and collaborating with another insulation firm based in Germany while working locally to increase the company’s footprint in Pakistan’s northern district of Chitral, a scenic yet underdeveloped area bordering the Himalayas. Finance The initial funding for Ghonsla’s pilot project came from Seed, Social Entrepreneurship and Equity Development, a venture which supports startups and grassroots innovations. Its incubation centres in Pakistan provide opportunities for young entrepreneurs in their early years of startup. It was established by friends Faraz Khan and Khusro Ansari and runs five distinct projects, including StartUp Dosti, a business plan based competition for early stage startups in India and Pakistan. It seeks to build relationships between the next generation of entrepreneurs from the two countries and the wider South Asian diaspora. As part of this it also launched Pakistan’s first television programme closely based on the BBC’s Dragons Den format. It is to be aired in India and Pakistan in November. Meanwhile a second conference is also being hosted by i-genius next month in Lahore to explore how social enterprise can transform Pakistan’s economic prospects. Blanket foreign aid funding of development projects in Pakistan, often linked to its fortune in the world of geopolitics, does not go beyond crisis management. What is more likely to get results, as some of these initiates demonstrate, is incentivising the country’s base economies which can be run on sustainable social enterprise models and help it break away from the cycle of aid dependency.

Jeff Radebe, minister for planning, monitoring and evaluation, made the announcement at a media briefing signalling progress between the two countries. If successful, this would be the world’s biggest hydropower project with the potential to power half of Africa. But as boardroom deals are made, questions continue to linger on the viability of the project. Who stands to benefit most from it? Is it sustainable? 54 years after the ground was first broken (pdf) for project, can Kinshasa guarantee that the new phase will not become a financial burden? The site for the project is in Bas Congo, a province at the extreme south-west of DRC. It is hoped that the potential 40,000MW output will power Africa’s industrial economic development. “The Inga project capacity is almost double China’s Three Gorges dam – currently the world’s largest hydroelectric project producing 22,500 MW,” said Isaac Kalua, founder of Nairobi based environmental group Green Africa Foundation. However, the dam is not without its critics. There are questions about its financing and what’s in it for the bankrollers. The World Bank and several other financial institutions like the African Development Bank, are funding the project to completion through grants and loans. “The project will strengthen DRC’s institutional capability by establishing an autonomous and transparent Inga Development Authority. The project will also finance technical, environmental, and social studies to develop the Inga III and selected mid-size hydropower projects sustainably,” said the World Bank in a press release earlier this year. South Africa will also finance part of the project. In 2013 it was reported that R200bn has been set aside and state owned power company, Eskom, will receive 2,500MW of the 4,800MW produced by Inga III, the project’s first phase. “The project will primarily benefit SA and mines in Katanga. Only 1000MW will be sold to national power company Société Nationale d’Electricité (Snel) for consumers in Kinshasa and surrounding areas,” said Ange Asanzi, Africa programme assistant for environmental lobby group International Rivers. DRC’s prime minister Matata Ponyo Mapon has said the Grand Inga will provide the country’s blue print for a better future. But on the world’s poorest continent, where natural wealth has largely failed to catalyse development, can projects like these lift people over the energy poverty line? “[The dams] will not solve the issue of energy poverty. Africa’s poorest live in rural areas. It is not cost effective to supply grid electricity to rural populations. Grid electricity is only cost effective in areas with a population density of at least 50 people per square meter,” Asanzi said. The International Energy Agency estimates that globally over 1.3 billion people cannot access electricity and 2.6 billion people are without clean cooking facilities. More than 95% of these people are either in sub-Saharan African or developing Asia and 84% are in rural areas. Rather than cut poverty, Asanzi argues that the project could potentially have a negative effect on communities. “People affected by Inga I and Inga II have never been compensated. Most of them will again be affected by Inga III. The resettlement action plan cites only five villages to be subjected to relocation, excluding many others.” The livelihoods of local communities are also at risk as the river is a major source of income for them. Kalua suggests this fear could morph into something bigger: “Huge volumes of water will be diverted. Drying rivers can lead to political unrest, since communities living downstream face the brunt of the reduction in volumes.” But the real elephant in the room is corruption. Inga I and Inga II were put up at a time of impunity among DRC’s political elite where there was little accountability regarding state expenditure. “Many politicians in DRC are still as driven by personal interests as they were 50 years ago,” says Asanzi. In a climate of mistrust and hope, Africa’s search for solutions to its energy deficit trudges on. Kenya and Ethiopia are betting on wind energy, while Ghana is banking on solar. South Africa is looking more and more towards importation. The need is great but experts remain cautious of the means employed to achieve a sustainable energy end. “As a continent we need to interrogate all these approaches that will result in an energy gain. We have to assess the environmental and humanitarian impact that these grand projects will have,” Kalua concludes.

I’ve decided any gadget that uses it is either a marvel or a prototype. The problem with solar energy is we’re not great at harnessing it yet. But it’s clearly a brilliant solution to our energy problems – just as we look back at the polluting, billowing smog of the industrial revolution, booing and hissing in pantomime fashion at how damaging it was, I like to think we’ll look back at mining and fracking for energy as the bone-idle sun beats down on our backs and say: “Look! It’s behind you!” Not that I’m hurrying the solar-energy scientists. They’re on it. The goal is in sight. And since the mainstream is still waiting for fully solar-powered flatscreens, cars and houses, we’re starting small with gadgets like solar-powered phone chargers and, in this week’s column, a radio and mp3 player. So how does it work? The Solar Condor DAB and FM radio is a pocket-sized portable radio, a bit smaller than a box of cigarettes, with a slot for a TF card (a micro SD card). A TF card loaded with songs means at the click of a button, you can turn the radio into an MP3 player. It comes with a pouch which doubles up as a set of two 2W speakers, with a solar panel on the front and a tiny blue light to indicate when it’s charging. Online reviewers were two and far between, and one was in Dutch. The Dutch reviewer gave it four stars and, if two online translators are anything to go by, he thought the quality of the FM was better than the quality of the DAB, he called it a “fun device” and ended his review with some version of “fun times ahead”. The English-speaking reviewer was a bit stingier. He only gave it three stars, but gave a thorough account of why: “It feels cheap and plasticy. The sound from the MP3 is good enough for listening to when you’re travelling. The FM radio works OK, and the DAB radio works pretty well too. Both rely on the headphones to be plugged in to act as the aerial. The biggest issue I have is with the MP3 controls. They are basically pitiful. When you turn the MP3 on it will always start navigation at the root folder stored on the memory card, so if you have your music stored by artist, then albums within each artists folder, prepare to spend a lot of time thumbing through the folders to get to the album you want to play.” My own verdict: the minus points • The micro SD/TF card itself is not included. I don’t know about you, but I get so annoyed when I have to make multiple purchases for one item, you’d think I’d been told to hitchhike to the Amazon warehouse to pick them up. But, irrational pet peeves aside, you’d be hard-pressed to find a TF card for over a fiver, so for a £69.95 product, surely they could chuck one in for free? • The MP3 controls were, as our online reviewer pointed out, a bit irritating – unlike the slick modern devices so many of us are spoiled by, there’s no quick scroll or search function, and thumbing through albums in order to find the one I wanted to hear is something I haven’t had to do for a while. • The shuffle function on the Condor is such that you can only shuffle songs from any one album. Telling your MP3 player “surprise me” doesn’t work when every song is from the same Tom Waits album. Eventually I gave up and submitted to listening to the tracks in order as the artists intended. • It comes with headphones that are mightily uncomfortable. They’re clearly made by someone who believes earholes to be perfectly round, so they either fall out or have to be shoved, somewhat painfully, right in. They’re made of the kind of plastic that makes your ears sweat, and there’s a tiny rattling sound when they shake. What I’m describing here is the experience of using cheap headphones after years of coddling my ears to the extent of £25 a pop. If your earholes are tougher than mine – or perfectly round – you might have a better time. And the plus points: • You don’t have to put the Condor on the windowsill or angle it directly towards the sun; as long as there’s light in the room, the little blue LED is blue, bright and eager, like the eyes of a Disney-animated bunny. • I’m not going to claim that the energy used up charging portable radio MP3 players is as big a drain on our collective resources as, say, phone charging or heating homes. But every time we use solar power over the kind of energy we pay to use, we’re chipping away at the current, environmentally expensive norm. Today, solar-powered radios, tomorrow, solar powered computers, TVs, cars, houses! • It’s versatile: you can charge it by solar power or USB. • Once fully charged, it works for hours. I left it playing all evening and night before the battery ran down. • It has a recording facility to record all the radio shows you’re missing while you fritter away your time working and sleeping (radio is brilliant, isn’t it? It’s like a podcast, but live! The wonders of old technology). • It’s portable, and not just because it’s light enough to carry around. There’s a nifty metal hook on the pouch so it can be attached to a backpack and charge in the sun as you walk around. (The product video suggests you attach it to your “pants” – by which I assume it means trousers – but I imagine that would get annoying very fast.) • At full volume, it’s loud. I couldn’t have it on full volume in my tiny flat as then I would be no better than my decibel-enthusiast neighbours. If I wanted to get back at them – or have music at a picnic – this would be ideal. In summation: It may not be as swish as some of the other gadgets in our lives, that can make calls and send emails and play movies and call in an air strike, but for a radio it does its job and doesn’t use electricity. And in an attempt to marry old and new technologies, I’m going to refer to it as “the wireless”.

The top heatwave tips you really need","bodyText":"Heatwave Britain: as you may or may not be aware, it is outrageously warm outside, hot enough to pose a grave danger to the British disposition. Below are some behaviours that readers are urged not to undertake, however hot they may become. 1. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to remember what it was like in 1976 I just tried this on the way to school. “I remember the heatwave of 1976, which we used to call the Great Heatwave.” “Really mummy? What was that like?” “Well, it was quite hot … we didn’t have the internet in those days, of course, so we couldn’t go online to tell each other how hot we were … and … well …” Just face it. Weather is impossible to remember. You can’t even remember what autumn feels like. This line of conversation will fatally undermine your credibility when it comes to other wisdoms you may wish to hand down. 2. Try not to be basically naked I know, it’s a conundrum. You don’t shop for this kind of weather. But a loosely fitting shirt and maybe some trousers will, far from causing you to overheat, actually offer some protection against the sun as well as preventing nakedness. 3. Don’t have five pints for lunch One of the things that makes me proudest to be British is the alacrity with which we will turn any event into an excuse to start drinking in the day. Royal wedding, birth of a royal, birth of Jesus – in fact all births, all deaths, all days on which banks are not open, Tube strikes. When the sun is so bright it obliterates the yardarm, that is as good as an invitation to go to the pub. However, it is injurious to health to overdrink in the sun, especially since you will probably be sitting outside, and around pint three you will go loopy and stop believing in sunscreen. 4. Don’t plan a major demonstration outside the House of Lords for the hottest day of the year that will mainly attract people who are over 75 For God’s sake! Is this some kind of sick joke? “Here, fans of assisted dying! How about some weather-assisted death?” 5. Don’t try and swim in the sea It’s filthy. And also surprisingly cold. 6. Don’t take this as an opportunity to do your first aerobic activity in 15 years There’s a reason you don’t see many marathon runners from hot countries. No, wait, that’s wrong … There’s a reason why marathon runners from hot countries are faster than you … it’s because you are accustomed to the cold. The best adaptive technique is to stay still until it is cold again. 7. Do go back in time and paint your roof white When sunlight is reflected off a white surface, the solar energy passes back through the atmosphere instead of warming the climate. Apparently. That’s the idea, anyway. Or you could get solar panels, that’d be good too. But don’t install them today (see point 6). 8. Don’t get into an argument about whether this weather is a result of climate change or is within the normal range There’s a reason they call them “heated”, arguments; they make you hot. There’s very little chance of resolution or mutual respect when you already started off hot. 9. Definitely don’t be pregnant Oh my sides. Poor you. You really should have thought this through. 10. Do eat holiday foods Then your brain will file this entire week under “holiday”, which will save you going on holiday. Suggestions: octopus from a tin; ice-cream; er … that’s it. *Helpful face.*"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/jun/21/australians-want-renewable-energy-target-retained-by-big-margin","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-21T21:04:13Z","webTitle":"Australians want renewable energy target retained by big margin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/21/australians-want-renewable-energy-target-retained-by-big-margin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jun/21/australians-want-renewable-energy-target-retained-by-big-margin","fields":{"headline":"Australians want renewable energy target retained by big margin","bodyText":"Australians overwhelmingly want the renewable energy target to be retained or even increased, as the Abbott government considers abolishing the incentive for new renewable projects. Polling for the Climate Institute shows 72% of Australians want to keep or expand the renewable energy target (RET), which requires that 20% of energy is sourced from renewables by 2020. This is slightly higher than the 69% who said they wanted the RET maintained or increased when the same questions were posed in last year’s poll, despite a strong campaign over the past year by industry groups and Coalition backbenchers arguing that the RET was increasing power prices. Respondents were then told “opponents of the scheme say the RET is a subsidy that drives up electricity bills, while supporters say it has helped create jobs and has tripled Australia’s wind and solar energy since 2009”. 71% still thought it should remain at its current level, 20%, or be increased, even after hearing the arguments. Support was especially high among women, with only 7% wanting the RET decreased or abolished. But government sources said the Abbott government is likely to “grandfather” the scheme after it receives the final report from its review of the program, led by businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton. This would see it deliver only about one third of the renewable power that was originally legislated – with bipartisan support. The sources said the challenge now was to work out how this could be achieved in practice. The Coalition went to the election promising to keep the RET, which underpins investment in energy sources such as wind and solar, but saying it would review the fact that the policy was exceeding its original goal of delivering 20% renewable energy by 2020 because of falling electricity demand. As yet unreleased modelling for business groups including the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has considered four options: leaving the RET as it is, reducing it to a “real” 20%, “grandfathering” it to allow only existing investments to continue, and abolishing it altogether. In its submission, the Institute of Public Affairs think tank, which favours abolition of the RET, says the government has three options, abolition, “grandfathering” or reducing it to a real “20%”. The RET is currently required to deliver 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewables by 2020 (which was 20% of what it was incorrectly estimated that the market would be). To deliver 20% of the current market this would have to be reduced to 33,000GWh. Grandfathering would deliver only 15,000GWh. The poll also found that 76% of people think state governments should do more to provide incentives to renewable energy. Again the strongest support came from women (82%). The poll was conducted for the Climate Institute by JWS research from May 16-20. The sample size was 1,145 and the margin of error is 2.9%. Warburton, a veteran industrialist and the chairman of the Westfield Retail Trust, described his views on climate science in a 2011 interview on ABC in this way: “Well, I am a sceptic. I’ve never moved away from that. I’ve always believed sceptical,’’ he said. “But a sceptic is a different person than a denier. I say the science is not settled. I’m not saying it’s wrong. I’ve never said it’s wrong, but I don’t believe it’s settled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2014/nov/13/rosetta-philae-comet-mission-what-went-right-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-can-be-fixed","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-13T20:40:42Z","webTitle":"Rosetta: what went right with Philae, what went wrong and how it can be fixed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/13/rosetta-philae-comet-mission-what-went-right-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-can-be-fixed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2014/nov/13/rosetta-philae-comet-mission-what-went-right-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-can-be-fixed","fields":{"headline":"Rosetta: what went right with Philae, what went wrong and how it can be fixed","bodyText":"More than 10 years ago the European Space Agency (Esa) launched Rosetta with a plan to slingshot the spacecraft around Earth until it caught up with comet 67P, the final destination of a vessel meant to make human history in outer space. The spacecraft carried a lander, Philae, designed to touch down on the comet, but Philae’s landing did not go quite as planned. What was supposed to happen ESA scientists hoped the comet would be a relatively even potato shape with plenty of flat surfaces suitable for landing on the 2.5-mile wide heap of ice, rock, dust and vapours, hurtling along at more than 11 miles per second. Rosetta’s controllers back on Earth tried to aim and time Philae’s release so that the comet’s weak gravity would slowly pull the lander to the site. Scientists had no control of Philae during its descent. Not far from the surface, controllers would order Philae’s thrusters to fire from on top of the lander, pushing Philae toward the comet. Once on the surface, they would send a command to shoot two harpoons from the lander into the comet’s crust, to prevent bouncing and secure it in place. The harpoons were also meant to counteract the plumes of gas and vapour that could knock Philae around, and will increasingly jet out of the comet as it approaches the sun. With about 60 hours of battery life, Philae would start snapping photos and doing experiments, and although the comet’s path would occasionally take Agilkia into shadow, solar panels mounted on Philae could recharge the battery and keep the lander busy into March 2015. What did happen Comet 67P turned out not to be shaped like a potato, as scientists hoped, and instead had an asymmetrical look “of a rubber duck”. Scientists identified Agilkia, a relatively open area about a third of a square mile as their best landing site, but had to manoeuvre Rosetta with thrusters for longer than expected to get it into the right spot for Philae’s drop. Before releasing the lander, they discovered early on Wednesday morning that a key thruster designed to press Philae down onto the surface of the comet was not working. They decided to go ahead with the landing anyway and launched the probe from the Rosetta mother ship at 8.35am GMT. Philae, rotating as it fell toward the surface, landed just about on target. The nitrogen thrusters failed, as expected, but the harpoons did not deploy, and in the extremely low gravity the lander bounced high up above the surface to a different location, where it bounced again. It took about two hours for Philae to settle after its initial touchdown. It came to rest around a kilometre from its intended landing site but the scientists are not yet sure exactly where. The lander manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec, told the BBC: We are still not anchored. We are sitting with the weight of the lander somehow on the comet. We are pretty sure where we landed the first time, and then we made quite a leap. Some people say it is in the order of one kilometre high. And then we had another small leap, and now we are sitting there, and transmitting, and everything else is something we have to start understanding and keep interpreting. Philae has so far lost and regained contact with mission control as expected, but scientists don’t know where exactly the lander is; the pattern of radio signals is one of the ways they’re measuring the two bounces. The first photo ever taken from a comet’s surface shows crags and a rock face, suggesting the lander is either facing the rim of a crater, against a cliff or at the bottom of a hole. Mission control says the lander is using solar energy, but “we’re getting one and a half hours of sunlight when we expected six or seven”. Philae’s variety of automated experiments have also begun, sending photos and data back through Rosetta to Esa. What they can try to fix it Although the landing gear was designed to “hop” Philae if necessary, it’s not clear whether ice screws on the lander’s legs have anchored the craft in such a way to make any movement feasible. A hop could topple the lander or shoot it up off the surface and away into space, as could an attempt to fire the harpoons. The lander has drills as well, meant to investigate the comet, and scientists are weighing whether to deploy these drills – to secure or nudge the lander and gather data before the battery dies. But for every action there is a reaction, and drilling puts the probe at high risk of falling over. Philae is “definitely not in the open”, the mission manager, Fred Jansen, told reporters, and if it’s stuck in a ditch then time is running out to perform experiments. With limited access to the sun, plans to use the lander for the next few months will have to change dramatically. Ulamec said the team will try to “modify the orientation” of the solar panels to get more sunlight, and that they’re changing Rosetta’s orbit to improve communication with Philae. Rosetta is also helping triangulate Philae’s location with a radar instrument called Consert. What if they can’t fix it The mission goes on as long as it can. Even if Philae turns out to be wedged in a comet’s cranny, experiments on the comet’s gases and compounds will proceed powered by whatever energy the solar panels can provide. As Dr Geraint Morgan explained to Open University, “we will sniff the comet no matter what happens” – meaning that the probe will still examine molecules drifting up from the surface. Many of the experiments are preprogrammed, and the Philae mission could help determine whether comets brought water to Earth, and whether they seeded our planet with chemical compounds (“organics”) that are the building blocks of life. Comets are ancient remnants of the solar system’s earliest moments, and even 60 hours of data could give a glimpse into what happened as the planets formed (or before they formed). The lander would have to drill to perform some of these experiments, but as time runs out the scientists will probably accept those risks. Philae may fade beyond human contact in the next few days, but Rosetta will probably keep flying round its comet for two more years, even as the comet spews more and more water, dust and gas, burning up as its orbit (and Rosetta’s) get closer to the sun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/23/boris-johnson-london-mayor-air-quality-award","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-23T16:10:47Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson wins international award for London’s air quality efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/23/boris-johnson-london-mayor-air-quality-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/23/boris-johnson-london-mayor-air-quality-award","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson wins international award for London’s air quality efforts","bodyText":"Boris Johnson, mayor of London, surprised clean air campaigners on Tuesday night by winning a prestigious international award for his efforts to improve the city’s air quality. The city faces stiff fines from Brussels over its repeated breaches of European Union air quality standards, with air quality likely to continue to fall below standards for years to come. Johnson was recently sharply criticised by a committee of MPs for failing to tackle air quality. Earlier this year, London suffered serious smog problems that led to warnings for vulnerable people, including children, the elderly and those with respiratory illnesses, to stay indoors for days. The C40 award judges cities around the world on their efforts to tackle air quality and climate change. London won the air quality award for its work on low-emissions taxis, and separately received another award for a new carbon accounting standard, described as an international best practice benchmark. Matthew Pencharz, the mayor’s senior adviser on environmental and energy issues, told the Guardian: “This is very good for us. This is going to stimulate the low-carbon economy, and taxi drivers will benefit from energy efficiency savings. London is showing practical delivery solutions to these problems [of air pollution and climate change].” He said: “We are the first to accept that air quality is a challenge. People accuse of us not doing anything, but I think anyone reasonable would say that Boris Johnson is doing everything he can to improve air quality in the capital.” The new zero-emission capable taxis are expected to reduce emissions by more than 75% compared to the average London taxi. In central London, where they will mainly operate in zero emission mode, emissions per taxi will be reduced by almost 100%. At present, London’s iconic black cabs account for around 15% of nitrogen oxide emissions in central London, and around 35% of PM10 emissions of large particles, which the mayor said would rise to 45% without intervention. But campaigners were critical of the award, saying that Johnson has not done enough to tackle London’s growing air pollution problem and it was “laughable” for him to receive such an accolade. “What a joke. Londoners will find it breathtaking that Boris is being awarded for totally failing to get to grips with our air quality crisis,” said Maria Eagle, shadow environment secretary. Darren Johnson, London assembly member for the Green Party, said: “We are running out of time to avert a climate catastrophe and the mayor of London should be at the forefront, advocating and delivering carbon reduction programmes on the scale needed, as well as zero carbon energy generating technologies like solar energy. Instead, Boris Johnson criticises wind farms, ignores the scientific consensus on global warming and promotes climate sceptic views. His backing of aviation expansion and fracking can only lead to one thing and that is the acceleration of global warming.” Johnson has made moves to tackle the air pollution problem, for instance by announcing this summer a rise in the congestion charge on the most polluting diesel-fuelled vehicles, but these plans will not come into effect until 2020. He has also introduced the city’s first age limits on taxis, which has resulted in the retirement of more than 3,000 of the oldest vehicles. The air quality award was made for a measure that would see “low-emissions capable” taxis on London’s streets from 2018. These taxis would cut down on emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which cause breathing difficulties in vulnerable people and can cause permanent harm to children’s lung development. However, the rules would only apply to new taxis licensed from 2018, which make up a small proportion of the total number of cabs, and they would only be required to use their low-emission capabilities in the central London low emissions zone, which does not cover the whole capital. Simon Birkett, founder and director of the Clean Air in London pressure group, said: “Boris is killing the taxi industry not saving it. He should be using his Twitter account to issue smog warnings not begging people to vote for him to win this prestigious international award.” He said: “The reality of Boris’s taxi strategy is that drivers are forced to buy one of two large, relatively expensive diesel vehicles because they are the only ones meeting the anachronistic 25 foot turning circle requirement. At the stroke of a pen he should remove the turning circle requirement and allow drivers to buy mass market petrol and other low emission vehicles at a fraction of the current cost of a taxi.” London’s iconic black cabs have long been required to have a tight turning circle, because of historic concerns over their manoeuvrability on London’s narrow streets. Birkett questioned whether the new rules would make a real difference, and asked: “Will Boris deliver a successful new taxi when he says he will, with funding complying with state aid rules and at a cost that allows taxi drivers to compete with private hire vehicles?” He also suggested it could take 15 years from 2018 to replace London’s existing 23,000 strong taxi fleet. • Fiona Harvey’s travel to New York was paid for by Siemens, which is a sponsor of the C40 awards for cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/29/uk-10-million-homes-solar-panels-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-29T16:50:49Z","webTitle":"UK should have 10 million homes with solar panels by 2020, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/29/uk-10-million-homes-solar-panels-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/29/uk-10-million-homes-solar-panels-2020","fields":{"headline":"UK should have 10 million homes with solar panels by 2020, experts say","bodyText":"Ten million homes in the UK should have their roofs covered with solar panels in the next six years, if the country is to fulfil its renewable energy potential, energy experts said on Wednesday. That number - of more than a third of households generating energy from the sun - would allow the UK to produce about 6% of its annual electricity needs from solar power, with as much as 40% coming from the panels on sunny days in summer, by 2020. These figures are comparable to those of Germany, which has made a major push on solar power in the last decade. Installing more solar panels brings the costs of the technology down dramatically, because of economies of scale, as the example of Germany and other countries shows. By 2030, the cost of solar should be comparable to that of even the dirtiest forms of coal, and of gas, said Ajay Gambhir, of Imperial College London. Nearly half a million homes in the UK have solar panels installed today, recent figures show. At present, the cost of solar power in Germany is about Euro cents 10 per kilowatt hour, compared with about 6 to 8 Euro cents per kilowatt hour for “brown” coal – the most carbon-intensive form of the fuel, but also the cheapest – and gas. On current trends that should reduce to 6 to 8 Euro cents per kilowatt hour for solar energy by 2030, while the cost of fossil fuels is expected to stay the same, according to academics from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, who published a briefing paper on the subject on Wednesday. But these aspirations will only be met in the UK if the government spearheads a move to install more solar panels, not just on houses but also on large public buildings and offices, and through the building of “solar farms”, in which large arrays of panels cover fields. Germany has managed to incorporate renewable power from sun and wind into its energy mix successfully, thanks in part to the government’s decision in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear incident to pursue an “energiewende” – a nationwide energy transformation – to remove nuclear power and concentrate more resources on renewable energy. The UK would face more serious challenges, said the researchers from Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute, as the incorporation of renewable energy into the electricity grid has so far been slow. Many of the UK’s current coal-fired power stations and ageing nuclear reactors will have to be taken out of service by the end of the decade, but efforts to replace this generation with renewable power have so far progressed slowly. The government began to row back on its commitment on subsidies to households with solar panels in 2011, scaling down dramatically the 'feed-in tariff' payments available, which created turmoil in the market. The prime minister, David Cameron, is alleged last year to have railed against the “green crap” in energy bills, by which he is understood to have meant charges for the roll-out of energy efficiency as well as subsidies for renewables. Solar energy could be in for a massive expansion in the UK, according to the research from the Grantham Institute, but this would require favourable policies to encourage the installation of millions more panels on rooftops across Britain. Modern photovoltaic panels can generate energy even in cloudy conditions, though they perform better when it is bright. In recent weeks, the main focus of government energy generation policy has been shale gas, which the prime minister spoke out for in Davos, the annual meeting of the rich and powerful. Ministers have argued that shale gas exploration could be a major source of indigenous energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/2014/oct/15/hawaiian-mission-to-mars-explore-furthest-frontiers-sustainability","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-15T14:19:42Z","webTitle":"Hawaiian mission to Mars will explore the furthest frontiers of sustainability","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/2014/oct/15/hawaiian-mission-to-mars-explore-furthest-frontiers-sustainability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/2014/oct/15/hawaiian-mission-to-mars-explore-furthest-frontiers-sustainability","fields":{"headline":"Hawaiian mission to Mars will explore the furthest frontiers of sustainability","bodyText":"The barren otherworldly landscape of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano is about as far from the swaying palm trees of Hawaii tourist brochures as you can get. But the six people who will enter a 36 foot diameter geodesic dome on Wednesday on the slopes of the second biggest volcano in the solar system are not there for a holiday. They are beginning an eight-month mission funded by the US space agency Nasa to test if humans will be able to withstand the long periods of confinement in a tight space that will be required to send a manned space mission to Mars some time around 2030. For Martha Lenio, the 34-year old renewable energy entrepreneur who is commanding the mission, it is something else besides: a chance to explore the furthest frontiers of sustainability. “It’s a very pared-down existence in space. You can only use the energy from the sun, the water that you bring with you, the food that you grow,” she says. “On Earth it is so large and forgiving we forget that we have to live within our limits. And that’s where I see the crossover between space and applications on Earth: if we can live like this in our space station it might be easier to do it on Earth.” Eight months is double the time the previous mission spent in the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation dome (Hi-Seas), which is run by the University of Hawaii and Nasa. The crew will be restricted to the double-storey dome and an attached shipping container, except for when they don simulation space suits for occasional sorties on the volcano. While they will wear biometric sensors and be constantly monitored by the researchers, they will only be able to communicate with a 20-minute time lag, simulating the time it would take to communicate with Mars. It would take 40 minutes to receive an answer to any message sent to mission control – one of the reasons that the participants, mainly engineers hand-picked by Nasa for their contribution to sustaining life within the pod, will have to be more self-sufficient than lunar astronauts who are in constant contact with Earth, Lenio said. The final six men and women were chosen after a six-day camping expedition in the Rockies, which tested not only their survival skills, but their ability to get on as a group. At the end of it, they voted on who they least wanted to share the mission with, and who they wanted to lead it. Being voted commander was a dream come true for Lenio, who began studying for a career in aerospace engineering because she wanted to be an astronaut, but switched to studying photovoltaic engineering because aerospace was too closely tied to the military. After six months volunteer teaching in Ghana, and four years working in the solar industry in Silicon Valley, she decided to return to Canada earlier this year and become partner in RALOS Solutions, a small renewable energy company. There she is working on developing smart grid and solar energy solutions for mining companies in the far north of Canada and a small island state in the Caribbean. She will closely monitor the energy system in the dome: a 10kw solar array, with a state-of-the art lithium-iron sulphide battery, backed up with a hydrogen fuel cell. In tests before the mission started, the batteries were almost fully recharged by the sun by 10am – a feat given the amount of electricity they were using cooking breakfast and the low level of the sun. “I’m interested in how the different energy production systems work together and how they balance each other,” says Lenio. “The dome’s system is very small scale and low voltage, but I want to see what control strategies on these low voltage systems could be applied to medium and high voltage as well for utility-scale power management.” She will also research growing food under different wavelengths of LED lighting and water conservation. Lenio said she and fellow crew member Neil Scheibelhut, a biologist who served as a medic in the Iraq war, will introduce water recycling in the dome using membrane filtering technologies in a bid to cut down on the monthly deliveries of water. “At the moment we are collecting it, but we aren’t reusing it” despite the fact that the dome has a dishwasher, washing machine and a shower. “If we can reuse most of our water that can have real-world applications,” she says. Nasa’s administrator, Charles Bolden, told the Royal Aeronautical Society in London last week that exploration of Mars was “important for the preservation of the human species” as the only planet other than Earth that could sustain life. But Lenio said Mars is no Noah’s Ark solution to the threat of climate change. There may be water, but it would be extremely difficult to access. “I don’t see going to Mars as an escape from our own planet. We could probably live five or 10 years – maybe 20 - before things would catch up with us; we would generate too much waste, not be able to create enough food or fuel and run out of usable water.” That’s not to say that we shouldn’t go to Mars, says Lenio, who hopes her leadership of this faux mission will one day equip her to participate in the real deal. “We wouldn’t even know about the holes in the ozone layer or the rate of deforestation in Brazil without the measurements we were able to do from space looking back on ourselves,” said Lenio. She points out that solar power only took off as a technology because it was used in space exploration. “Maybe all the things we learn about sustainability along the way will turn out to be the most useful thing about going to Mars.” Read more stories like this: Rather than desecrate the Arctic should business mine the moon?

But that is a global picture. Nationally, the situation varies greatly, depending on the attitude of the incumbent government. When it comes to domestic market growth, and building a national solar industry, the UK is very much in the \"jury out\" category at the moment. This is partly because of an internal battle of ideas between solar believers and those who envision the UK as a \"gas hub\", on the road to which solar is a distraction that might put off investment in UK fracking. Using commercial rooftops for solar generation is especially important, for three reasons. First, there is enormous vacant, functionless, roofspace on warehouses, factories and the like and a quarter of a million hectares of it faces south. Second, companies can save money by solarising their roofspace - and third, commercial roofs are where the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) says it wishes to see much of the solar installed in the future. The total amount of solar PV installed in the UK now exceeds 4.6GW. In comparison, the total in Germany - world leaders in solar as well as football - exceeds 30GW. Roughly half of the UK solar is ground-mounted, and half on roofs. Of roof-mounted solar, by far the majority is on residential buildings. According to SolarCentury's analysis of Ofgem statistics, only around 400 commercial-scale (100kWp or larger) solar PV systems have been installed out of approximately 1.8m commercial properties in the UK. This represents a tiny fraction of all UK solar. Yet in continental Europe, almost a third of all solar is on commercial roofs. So why has there been so little uptake in the UK? There are two reasons. The first involves government policy. The second involves the difficulties companies face when considering whether to opt for solar roofs. The government has decided it doesn't like ground-mounted solar. This is strange, because opinion polls consistently show solar is the most popular renewable with the UK public, including when mounted in appropriate sites on the ground. DECC wants to end Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCS), from which ground mounted solar currently benefits, prematurely, in March 2015. It had told investors earlier that ROCs would stay in place until 2017. The government says that its proposed policies will drive a market in commercial roofs instead. The trouble is, as things stand, it won't. Feed-in tariffs will be used to encourage solar on commercial roofs instead. However, the rate they propose fails to attract companies other than ardent pioneers. It needs to be higher for a few short years until solar costs fall to the point that no subsidies are needed at all. The Solar Trade Association calculates this will happen by 2020. However, when companies do install solar, they do not seem to have any regrets, that we know of. According to Paul Donnelly, CSR manager at Big Yellow: \"Our solar programme has helped us cut carbon as well as our energy bills – so we have actually been making money from our roofs.\" Over the last six years, Solarcentury has installed 16 PV roof systems for Big Yellow across its extensive roof spaces, providing up to 20% of the electricity demand. Now Solarcentury is intent on making the experience for companies – and hopefully, soon, the mass market - even simpler. A new approach to planning and executing solar projects means that retailers of all sizes can overcome the obstacles that commonly hinder businesses from going solar. We are doing our bit to unlock the huge commercial roof spaces of the UK. The government now needs to do theirs.

And so 1.4 billion people are currently living without electricity. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 8% of the population in rural areas has access to mains electricity but mini-grids – localised generation, transmission and distribution of power – could change all that. As the cost of solar energy in rural Africa, parts of India and other countries in Asia has fallen dramatically in recent years, setting up a mini-grid powered by renewable energy has become the cheapest way to provide electricity. The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has recently awarded a $5m low-cost loan to the government of Mauritania, where just 1% of rural communities are electrified. The loan will help pay for an electricity grid to serve four fishing towns spread along Mauritania's northern coast. The people of Bellewakh, Lemcid, Loubeir and Lemhaijratt currently get by with candles, kerosene lamps and car batteries for lighting, and use costly and dangerous canisters of butane to power refrigeration units. Their new mini-grid will consist of 18 wind turbines of 15kW and will provide electricity for households, schools, health facilities, civic buildings, a desalination plant to produce drinking water and an ice-making plant. Frank Wouters, director of Irena, says there is \"huge demand\" for projects like this. His organisation has $50m a year to give out in low cost loans but last year received bids for projects totalling $1bn. Irena was able to assist six projects with funding but they had to turn down over 80 others. Where mini-grids already exist but are currently powered by diesel Wouters says it is now a no-brainer for them to switch to renewables: \"Where people are using diesel to generate electricity any renewable source of energy is at the moment more cost effective.\" Hydroelectricty is by far the cheapest – where it is available – followed by windpower, and then solar panels. A report by the Alliance for Rural Electrification found that towns could save up to 60% of their bill if they switched from diesel to a hybrid of diesel and hydroelectricity or 16% if they switched to a hybrid of diesel and solar. The cost effectiveness of renewable energy has really changed the marketplace. Before, says Wouters, people thought: \"solar is nice for [communities that are] off-grid, but it's expensive, but that is not true anymore. It's now cheap as well as being reliable, clean and low maintenance.\" So why aren't renewably-powered mini-grids popping up everywhere? Wouters says the first challenge has been making people aware of the falling prices. \"When something halves in price every two years it's hard to catch up, but I think that we've reached the point were people understand. \"There is a big focus by the Asia Development Bank on mini-grids and the Islamic Development Bank; all the development banks are looking at this as a very interesting, scalable opportunity for them to put their money to work.\" Second is the reality of little or no infrastructure to begin with, which means not even diesel is getting to poor rural communities. Before rural electrification can happen there needs to be some infrastructure in place, capacity building for human resources and sustainable business models. \"The bottom line is that this is less and less a renewable energy issue, now it is just a development issue,\" Wouters says. The good news is that African economies are growing. Six out of 10 of the fastest growing economies in the world are in Africa. Combine that with the development banks' interest in mini-grids and suddenly the future is looking brighter. With every new installation the skills base is developed and the infrastructure grows a little. As Wouters said, all the problems that accompany any development still exist however, it is encouraging that the solution is getting cheaper and therefore just a little bit easier to reach.

They are often turgid affairs conducted in the ballrooms of hotels so identical to one another that you can't tell whether you are in Singapore or Manchester. The same speakers are there, for the most part droning on about the same thing they droned on about at the last conference. I should know, I am one of them. But occasionally, just occasionally, someone says something so radically new that it causes you sit up and actually listen. Your neighbours are no longer fiddling with their smartphones; there is the proverbial buzz in the air. This was the scene at the Materials Research Society conference in Boston last December, where a breakthrough in perovskite solar cells was announced. If perovskites mean nothing to you read on, as they may have a very big impact on your future fuel bill. If we could capture approximately 1% of the sunlight falling on to the British Isles and turn it into electricity we would meet our current energy demands. The reason no one suggests doing this rather than building wind, nuclear or conventional power stations is the cost. We currently use silicon solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity but they are expensive and require subsidies. Silicon is a poor conductor of electricity because all of its four outer electrons are bound up in the chemical bonds holding the crystal together. However, by adding a tiny amount of phosphorous, which has five outer electrons, you effectively add a free electron to the crystal and make it conduct moderately well. Similarly, you can add boron, which has only three outer electrons, and effectively do the same thing, only now the conducting charge is called an electron hole. The magic comes when you put a phosphorous silicon layer next to a boron silicon layer: the holes and the electrons cancel each other out at the junction but create an electric field that means that electrons only like to flow in one direction across the junction. This is called a diode. There are many flavours of diodes, each having a different junction architecture. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit light when electrons flow across the junction but the opposite effect also works: light hitting the diode creates an electric current, and this is how a solar cell works. Silicon solar cells are as intricately micro-engineered as the silicon chips in your smartphone or tablet, but instead of being the size of a postage stamp they are the size of a table. They are made in enormous billion-dollar clean-room and high-temperature fabrication facilities, which are expensive precisely because controlling the purity of the silicon and the doping levels of phosphorous and boron is not trivial. It is also energy intensive. Although prices have been coming down, fossil fuels are still so cheap it is very hard for silicon solar cells to compete. Materials scientists have been exploring other semiconductor technologies for a long while, trying to find something cheaper and better than silicon. Until recently the best bet was dye-sensitised solar cells. These have been around since the 1980s, but they have not managed to make a big impact on the energy market because, although they are cheap because they don't require billion-dollar clean-room facilities, their efficiency is generally low. This is where the new perovskite solar cells come in. There are exotic-sounding compounds, such as methylammonium trihalogen plumbates, that have a quite simple crystal structure called a perovskite. Like the dye-sensitised solar cells, these solar cells are easy and cheap to make, but they have another trick up their sleeve – they don't need a complicated diode architecture to achieve high efficiencies. Materials researchers in Oxford, led by Dr Henry Snaith, have recently shown that they can make simple perovskite solar cells with efficiencies pushing 20%. This is big news, because 20% makes them competitive with existing commercial silicon solar cells while being much cheaper to make in high volumes. They are also more suitable for incorporating into roofing materials and glass panels than silicon and so have the clear potential of being as fundamental to our city architecture as steel, concrete and asphalt. In other words, they could well be the materials that will make it possible to collect the 1% of solar energy we need as a nation, at a cost that can compete with fossil fuels. Hearing research results such as this makes you grudgingly admit conferences are worth going to, and indeed gets you wondering whether we might look back in 10 years and pinpoint this as the time the solar energy revolution really ignited. One of my industry colleagues believes so; after the talk he immediately Skyped his research group, told them to stop what they were doing and get working on perovskite solar cells. The race to commercialise them is on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/oct/12/-sp-smart-homes-environment-consumption-future-tech","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-12T14:00:14Z","webTitle":"The future sustainable home: low-tech or high-tech?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/12/-sp-smart-homes-environment-consumption-future-tech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/12/-sp-smart-homes-environment-consumption-future-tech","fields":{"headline":"The future sustainable home: low-tech or high-tech?","bodyText":"More than 2,500 gathered at the Austin Convention Center in Texas for the fourth annual SXSW Eco last week. But environmental science professor Jeff Wilson spent most of his time in a dumpster across the street. That’s where he lives: a 36 sq-foot trash container tricked out with LED lighting, non-toxic paint, an energy monitoring system, and a bucket for his bathroom waste. Wilson – aka “Professor Dumpster” – moved into his dumpster pad last February as part of a year-long experiment in living sustainably. He sleeps on a floor on a futon and did a fair amount of sweltering this summer before he got air-conditioning, but in October he enjoys the pleasant breeze. “I may live in a dumpster, but I can still enjoy a sustainable lifestyle,” he said. “I make Turkish coffee, get on my laptop and do Twitter, read and lounge out.” In the final phase of what he plans to be the über-dumpster, he’s going to add solar panels, a composting toilet, and other features to complete his revolutionary tiny home design. “We’re essentially building a space capsule inside a dumpster,” Wilson said. Wilson, who teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, parked his Dumpster Project outside the sustainable business conference to make the point that happiness has little to do with materialism – and that ultimately, living well may well mean living with less stuff. In stark contrast, four floors up in the convention center was Honda’s version of a smart home: a snazzy demo of the 2,000 sq-foot model smart home, which the company recently unveiled at the University of California at Davis. The project, which includes open-sourced plans, is the brainchild of senior project engineer Michael Koenig, who aims to demonstrate how distributed solar energy and plug-in electric vehicles can join forces to provide zero-carbon living and high-efficiency mobility. From a products perspective, Honda’s gadget-laden “high-tech” model looks like it’s for people too lazy to turn their own thermostats. But from a systems standpoint, applying these plans across the residential sector could considerably reduce carbon emissions by mitigating the impact of our society’s biggest emitters: transportation and electricity. “I’m a car guy, but I was also interested in building a green home,” Koenig said. “I saw a need to fill a void and show what was possible.” Companies such as Honda see the smart home as an opportunity for growth, with plug-in electric vehicles like the Fit EV joining forces with solar panels to enable zero-carbon living. Retail pioneer Garrett Boone, co-founder of The Container Store, says he now sees the “same kind of retail opportunity for smart homes today as I saw for home organization in 1978”. To tap that market, Boone is an investor in and chairman of TreeHouse, a new Austin-based smart home retailer, for which I’m an unpaid board member. (Watch my video interview with Boone here.) The nascent smart home movement is rapidly growing into a market force. According to a study released by Juniper Research, the smart home market could reach $71bn by 2018 – up from $33bn in 2013, and $25bn in 2012. Plus, the phrase “smart home” – like the word “sustainability” – defies simple definitions. Models may succeed where words fail in conveying the essence of “smart-homeness”. But the two models also demonstrate a key disagreement about what sustainability will look like in the future: will it be high-tech with an EV in the garage, or low-tech and tiny? From smart homes to a smarter society Another essential question remains. Will all these smart homes actually make living more sustainable? Rising energy costs, both actual and unaccounted for, as well as escalating financial and climate events are putting advanced societies in a state of continual disruption. And in the developing world, people still lack basic services. For example, over 40% of the world’s population still doesn’t have a place to go to the bathroom. Adjacent to the dumpster house sat another primitive-type innovation – a double-container composting toilet from SmallSmall, a semi-finalist for the startup showcase. The new venture from a team of Dallas-based architects is based on a concept from recent University of Pennsylvania grad Gray Garmon, who came up with the idea while serving in the Peace Corps. The idea represents a micro-business opportunity to help entrepreneurs profit from providing basic human services. The dumpster-latrine combo was definitely a low-tech version of a smart home. So which is the real smart home? It comes down to context. Honda’s model still won’t work for most Americans or in a lot of developing economies. As Jigar Shah pointed out, building smart homes may not be nearly as important as building the boring yet necessary infrastructure that is still lacking. “There’s this really cool new technology called a ditch,” said Eric Klinenberg, only half joking as he displayed pictures of buried electrical wires, pointing out the absurdity of continuing to string electricity on precarious poles in disaster-prone regions. Smart homes are a starting point, but the next frontier will be smart communities, smart cities and smart regions. We won’t get there without smart people. And some luck. After all, plenty of companies that made their mark in years past are now gone. It’s still an open question how sustainability – in our homes, businesses and cities – will play out. But no matter which sustainability ventures succeed or fail, we will keep getting smarter if we retain the knowledge we accumulate along the way. Sharing the lessons we learn will give us a chance of creating more than smart homes - but also smart supply chains, smart regions and a smarter culture. This article was amended 14 October.

How important is it to look at energy and water together? It is crucial; they are two sides of the same coin. We need energy to make clean water available, provide proper irrigation systems and to recycle water. At the same time you need water for cooling and for generating energy. The energy sector accounts for 25-30% of water extraction from freshwater systems and energy demand will increase 50-60% over the next 25 years. So if we are going to demand more energy it means we are going to extract more water. The reasons for joined-up thinking seem obvious, so why have the sectors remained separate for so long? Natural inertia and only thinking – and innovating – in their own narrow fields. There are only a few countries that have demonstrated successful collaboration. Israel, for example, has always looked at energy, food and water together: this is where the drip irrigation technology comes from. To a certain extent the Brazilians are also making progress, but these knowledge systems need to impact the rest of the world, especially where population will be rising the fastest. Collaboration is easy to talk about, but how do you actually make it happen? For the water and energy, what we have done in the post-2015 agenda is to propose “nexus” targets. In the case of energy, we now have goal seven: access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy services for all. It has three targets, but we originally submitted seven. Four of those targets were all nexus targets relating to water, health, women’s empowerment and food. This was intended to force global leaders to realise that they can’t treat these issues in silos anymore. In the negotiations they have adopted three; we believe that the rest will be adopted as indicators. This means we are forcing development thinking to be joined up. We also need to work at building capacity in developing countries where these issues will be most serious, but they also have the opportunity to leapfrog. How do we ensure that they build their capacity so that when they are doing urban design policy, for example, the energy minister and the water minister are sitting together? ‘Nexus’ policymaking recognises complexity. Is there a sense within those working specifically in the energy sector that this approach might slow down progress on specific issues? Yes, and it does becomes more difficult. For example, it slows down the process of design because it requires more thought. In some cases it also makes the coordination more difficult: it means you have to work among many players and many ministries with three complex issues. So, yes, it will slow down progress. However, this is why you need good technical and global institutions that can spread best practice. It is a bold choice to pursue but we have to be bold. So far we have made progress with the sustainable development goals (SDGs): we finally got a goal on energy. So we forced leaders to think about the issue. Remember there was no mention of energy in the millennium development goals – it was as if we took energy for granted. Later this month the Climate Summit will be kicking off in New York. Do you have any specific plans for it? We will be presenting a concrete plan, alongside commercial banks and some development banks, to raise $120bn (£74bn). We will share how we will do it and how it will happen within the climate finance package. How do we raise the first $120bn? We have six instruments that have been developed. One example is how we scale up green bond finance instruments, from the current $23bn a year to maybe $50bn or $60bn a year. Also, thanks to the EU and US, we will announce there that we have a plan to reduce energy poverty by half, by 2030 or 2035. The EU has committed, along with the German government, to support 600 million energy-poor people with modern energy services. The Americans will also announce another $100m in Africa. If the US and the EU fulfill their commitment, we will reduce energy poverty by half. With the SDGs and COP 2015 in Paris on the horizon, the next year will be decisive for energy. What are your hopes for the year ahead? I have high hopes for the Paris conference, I know we will get a deal. Although, whether it will be the transformative deal we all dream about – that will keep us below 2 degrees – remains to be seen. We know we need a lot of money. We estimate we need $600-800bn a year to achieve the three targets of SE4All. Remember that today other energy technologies enjoy $500bn a year of subsidies. How much went into renewables? $80bn. Can we level the playing field a little bit to give alternative energy a chance?

The list is made up of 100 private companies that are set to shape the cleantech market in the next 5-10 years. The 2013 list contains six solar companies, compared with 12 in 2012. The decrease mirrors the decline in private equity investments in solar companies in recent years. Solar accounted for nearly 40% of all cleantech investments in 2008 before plummeting to 10% during the first half of 2013, according to the Cleantech Group. Many venture capital investors have said publicly that they are staying away from investing in solar manufacturing technologies and, in particular, new materials and processes to make solar cells. Investments into cell technologies that promised to deliver cheaper solar cells that could convert sunlight into electricity more efficiently have largely been duds, primarily because those technologies took much longer and required more capital to bring to the market. And they haven't delivered expected returns. The uneasy feeling about the peril of investing in solar hardware surfaced before the fall of Solyndra in 2011. The California solar company filed for bankruptcy after spending nearly all of the $535m (£335m) loan from the federal government to build a factory and realising that it couldn't compete in price with cheaper solar panels from rivals, especially those from China. Solyndra's collapse and the big political debate over the government's role in supporting cleantech development also dampened the enthusiasm for private investments in solar. Since then, investors have shown a preference for solar companies that develop software and offer either installation or financing services, or both, to consumers and businesses. Four of the six solar companies on the Cleantech 100 list this year belong to that category and all are from California: Clean Power Finance, Mosaic, Sungevity and Sunrun. \"Let's face it. If you look at the profitability equation, venture capitalists are looking for a massive market and solutions with low fixed and variable costs,\" said Nat Kreamer, CEO of Clean Power Finance, which offers leases or power purchase agreements in which consumers would pay for the solar electricity from their rooftop solar panels but not own the equipment. \"The solar financing and service companies are great investments because we have low fixed cost, we are scalable and we serve a massive industry.\" Both Clean Power Finance and Sunrun focus on offering financing packages to installers who then market them to home and business owners. Sungevity offers financing as well and hires local contractors to do the installation work. Mosaic lines up solar power projects by outside developers and creates an online portal for the public to invest in any of them for as little as $25. Mosaic promises to deliver a steady annual return to the investors over 5-10 years. What these four solar companies also have in common is their focus on the rooftop solar market, which has grown steadily thanks largely to government policies and incentives. In the US, the rooftop solar market, in which solar energy systems produce power for use onsite or for export into the grid, is set to grow from 1,353 megawatts in 2012 to 3,552 MW in 2017, according to GTM Research. Worldwide, the rooftop solar market will likely increase from 15,941 MW to 26,732 MW during the same period, GTM said. Countries such as India and China, where governments have set aggressive solar installation goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and in some cases support domestic solar equipment manufacturers, have emerged to fast-growing solar markets. Japan also has become an important market after the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011 prompted the Japanese to regard solar energy as a much safer clean power alternative. The fifth solar company on Cleantech 100, California-based SolarEdge, engineers electronics that monitor the production output of the solar panels and convert the direct current (DC) from the panels into alternating current (AC) for onsite use or feeding into the grid. The power electronics for converting DC to AC are a must for any installation that uses solar panels, and they are expected to play a greater role in monitoring and adjusting the flow of solar energy into the grid as the rooftop solar market grows. The grid will suffer blackouts among other problems if its owner, the utility, doesn't maintain a balance of power supply and demand. That balance is easier to achieve when electricity can flow uninterrupted and steadily from power plants that burn coal and natural gas. Solar energy production is more temperamental, and its infusions into the grid require better sensors and communication technologies to coordinate. The sixth solar company on the list, GlassPoint Solar, is quite different from the other solar companies chosen this year. The company, also based in California, installs equipment that uses mirrors to concentrate and direct the sunlight onto water-containing steel pipes to produce steam. GlassPoint's target customers are oil and gas companies, which would inject the steam into the ground to pry loose the sticky oil that clings to rock fissures, making it easier to pump up to the surface. The company has completed projects in California and Oman. GlassPoint's inclusion reflects a recent trend in which cleantech companies are finding more sales opportunities in the oil and gas market. Oil and gas companies tend to be rich in cash and willing to spend money on technologies that could improve their production, reduce environmental impact (and avoid lawsuits) and, as a bonus, reduce carbon footprint. While solar technology isn't a favourite of venture capital investors as it was several years ago, its importance hasn't diminished in the global effort to use cleaner power and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Investors haven't completely avoided betting on solar materials and cell development. But they have perhaps learned some good lessons about setting both the investment criteria and more realistic expectations. In the meantime, solar software and service companies are finding financial support that enables them to expand the use of solar energy in many corners of the world.

In a report prepared for the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, experts from 30 international institutions set out a range of strategies for the economies responsible for more than two-thirds of global emissions. The initiative is the first of its kind to try to make concrete plans around the various targets that have been discussed at the UN climate change negotiations over the last two decades, said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, and a leader of the Pathways to Deep Decarbonisation Project. “All we have been doing in these negotiations for all these years is talking about things in the abstract. It’s not producing the deep technological changes that can get us to a low-carbon global economy,” he told the Guardian. The report, with its detailed data on electricity supply, transport and shipping, and building codes in each country, was aimed at remedying this by making the targets operational, he said. It is hoped the study will help to build momentum for a UN climate change summit in New York this September, and so advance the negotiations to reach a global climate deal by the end of 2015. The study looks at the world’s 15 biggest economies: America, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea, which between them account for 70% of global emissions. It rejects the idea that has taken hold since the failed Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 that warming of 4 or 5C is already inevitable. “We do not subscribe to the view held by some that the 2C limit is impossible to achieve and that it should be weakened or dropped altogether,” the report said, adding that the science about the 2C threshold was clear. “The political risks of jettisoning the 2C limit are also significant,” the report went on, and would further weakening the chances of any action. Instead, it was time for leaders to direct government officials and independent institutions to work on the technologies that would actually produce reductions in emissions. To date, the targets discussed at the UN climate talks were detached from reality, the report said. “By and large national targets are not derived from an assessment of what will be needed to stay within the 2C limit,” it said. Sachs said that was in part a function of the UN negotiations process, that left a highly technical discussion to diplomats. “It put the lawyers out front and left the technologists out of the room, and the result is that we have had 21 years of lawyering and no success in application of the international framework,” he said. The result, he said, were emissions reductions targets that were far too conservative to avoid 2C warming. “I didn’t hear President Obama say we have a 2C agreed global warming limit, and I am basing American policy on making sure that is successful. I have not heard any leader saying that,” he said. “Actually, now we have a report that will tell them what it would take.” Those options vary widely according to the country. The report envisages that Britain by mid-century would generate about 35% of its electricity from nuclear power plants and 40% from coal using carbon capture technologies. America too will remain heavily invested in coal, and could generate up to 35% of its electricity from coal using carbon capture technologies. South Africa, which is now heavily dependent on coal, could generate 80% of its electricity from solar energy, while countries such as Australia could achieve cuts in their emissions by switching to electric cars and public transport. The report acknowledges that the technologies it incorporates in its findings – including carbon capture – are not yet available on a widespread, commercial scale. It also makes no attempt to offer a cost-benefit analysis of the sweeping transformation that would be needed in all 15 countries to keep warming within 2C. Sachs said those aspects would be dealt with in a final report due next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainability/blog/2014/may/28/guardian-supply-chain-newpaper-sustainability","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainability","sectionName":"Sustainability","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-28T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"How can the Guardian's supply chain make newspapers more sustainable?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/blog/2014/may/28/guardian-supply-chain-newpaper-sustainability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainability/blog/2014/may/28/guardian-supply-chain-newpaper-sustainability","fields":{"headline":"How can the Guardian's supply chain make newspapers more sustainable?","bodyText":"How can businesses work with their suppliers to do more to address the environmental and social responsibilities in their supply chain? Over the last few years Guardian News and Media (GNM) has worked hard to improve the sustainability of our newspapers. For example, by working with our supplier we have improved the efficiency of print sites and ensured 98% of our paper is from sustainable sources. Last week, at a conference in our London offices for our print suppliers we began to explore how we might do more to address sustainability goals through collaboration. We wanted to create an open space where suppliers could talk about their challenges and achievements. The day The day consisted of presentations from keynote speakers from B&amp;Q and Marks and Spencer who have done interesting work with their suppliers, as well as presentations from our suppliers and space for questions and discussion. Our print suppliers are already addressing sustainability issues and their presentations highlighted some of their achievements to date, Sun Chemical’s solar energy initiatives, Agfa’s water treatment plant, UPM Shotton’s on site material recovery facility, Smith News’ energy saving projects or Polestar Group's closed loop paper recycling. There was common ground around key areas such as energy and fuel saving, carbon emission, air quality, waste reduction, water use and sustainable resource use. There was a tangible appetite for collaboration to specific difficulties that stop us from achieving our sustainability goals. We identified data and reporting, legislation, staff motivation and internal buy-in, reputation and communication, funding and capital investment and commercial and market reality as significant challenges for all. Presentations from Adam Elman, Global Head of Plan A Delivery for Marks and Spencer and Matthew Sexton, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility at B&amp;Q provided inspiration and potential pointers for the road ahead. Adam Elman encouraged us to think big with ambitious targets that delivered real change - along with a “not afraid to fail” mind set. Matthew Sexton, highlighted the need to ask questions and listen because the suppliers are experts in their area and can bring new ideas that customers miss. Both speakers emphasised the need for collaboration to identify and deliver solutions whether through official working groups or more unofficial relationships. Our findings The day raised some big challenges that could take a long time to resolve and some quick wins. It was seen as a great opportunity for conversation between suppliers and meeting new contacts. The day gave us a much better insight into our suppliers and what they are doing. It also helped us to better understand where we need to do more research to identify specific challenges and projects and the questions we should be asking our suppliers. But it was too early to get an understanding of what those big targets that Adam Elman spoke about might look like. It seems like it is not going to be a simple or easy process but as one supplier put it, If there were an easy answer we would not be here discussing it. We are asking for feedback from our print chain suppliers on what they got out of the day and what they would like to see next. We are also keen to hear more widely from both - supplier and customer - on how they have worked to address their own sustainability challenges. Please have your say in the comments below.

The dam, to be built across the Dibang river, in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, will be the country’s largest. The state plans to build more than 160 dams in the coming years. Dibang dam will not only generate power but supposedly control floods in the plains of neighbouring Assam state. The dam’s reservoir was estimated to submerge 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) of dense forests along the Dibang river valley. The forest advisory committee (FAC), which examines the impact of infrastructure projects on wilderness areas, was appalled and rejected it. For a project so large, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) failed to assess critical components of the project and was widely criticised for inadequately predicting the dam’s effects on the environment. Its evaluation of impacts on wildlife is a farce. The authors of the document list creatures not found in that area, such as Himalayan tahr, and concocted species not known to exist anywhere in the world, such as brown pied hornbill. Of the ones they could have got right, they mangled the names, referring to flycatchers as ‘flying catchers’ and fantail as ‘fanter’. In his scathing critique, Anwaruddin Choudhury, an expert on the wildlife of north-east India, sarcastically concluded the EIA makes a case for the project to be shelved, as Dibang was the only place in the world “with these specialities!” Despite listing these amazing creatures, the EIA goes on to say “no major wildlife is observed”. In a similar vein, the document claims only 301 people will be affected by the dam. Authorities must be puzzled that a project with so few affected people should be opposed by so many. Protests by local people began soon after the inaugural stone was laid in 2008. Since then large crowds have disrupted public hearings. On 5 October 2011, police fired on one such mass demonstration, injuring 10 people. Regional authorities branded anti-dam protestors as Maoist rebels, further angering them. In Arunachal Pradesh, the Idu Mishmi and Adi tribes will be the most affected. They fear loss of grazing land, fishing grounds, and lack of safety of the dam in a seismically volatile zone. Additionally, they are concerned that the large number of workers needed to build the dam will overwhelm their cultural identity and their lands. When the FAC first rejected the project in June 2013, it said the “ecological, environmental and social costs of diversion of such a vast track of forest land, which is a major source of livelihood of the tribal population of the state, will far outweigh the benefits likely to accrue from the project”. Some of the grassland-covered river islands in the Dibang river are the prime habitat of the critically endangered Bengal florican. The ministry’s recovery plan for the bird species recommends the area be designated as a national park. Neeraj Vagholikar, an environmentalist familiar with the case, who works for NGO Kalpavriksh, lists the concerns of people downstream in Assam: loss of fisheries, loss of agricultural land on river islands, increased vulnerability to floods caused by removal of boulders from riverbeds for dam construction, sudden release of water from the reservoir in the monsoons, and safety of the dam in a geologically fragile and seismically active region. Under public pressure, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi told prime minister Narendra Modi in July this year, “We urge that all hydro electric projects be taken up only after consideration of dam safety, flood moderation and downstream impact mitigation measures in consultation with government of Assam.” Arunachal Pradesh resubmitted the proposal in February 2014, dropping the height of the dam from 288 metres to 278 metres and saving 1,100 acres of forest. The FAC rejected it again in April 2014. Prakash Javadekar’s ministry of environment and forests also rejected the proposal on 28 August 2014, and cited these reasons in its letter: “[The] proposed area is very rich in biodiversity, sensitive ecosystem being at the edge of hills and flood plains and having large number of endemic and endangered flora and fauna, etc. Moreover, such project is most likely to have considerable downstream impact including impact on the Dibru-Saikhowa NP [national park] in Assam which is yet to be studied.” That ought to have put paid to the dam project. Instead, the prime minister’s principal secretary revived it in early September. This time it sailed through the clearance process. At the time of writing, the minutes of the FAC meeting granting approval have not been made public, and the final height of the dam is still unconfirmed. Anti-dam activists suspect the height of the dam may be lower by 20 metres, and the dam is likely to submerge 4,300 hectares (10,586 acres) of forest. Javadekar has repeatedly stated he supported development without destruction of environment. But it’s just a matter of days before he affixes his seal of approval to the dam. The FAC’s previous concerns for the area’s biodiversity and the lack of studies of the impact in Assam were brushed aside. A project that claims to control flooding in Assam has not conducted one public meeting in that state nor was the chief minister’s demand for consultation acknowledged. The ministry’s own concerns about the impact on Dibru-Saikhowa national park remain unaddressed. This is the latest in a series of moves made by the government to push large projects at the cost of the environment. When he was a prime ministerial candidate, on 22 February 2014, Modi had said in a speech at Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh: “I know that the people of the state are against the building of big dams, and I do understand their sentiments. We can still tap those potentials with proper scientific technology and small dams, besides using solar energy to supplement them.” Either he had changed his mind in six months, or he never meant what he said then. However, forcing these approvals through may not make an iota of difference. The 2,000MW lower Subansiri hydroelectric power project got all its clearances, and yet after spending over £500m, the project was brought to a halt in December 2011. The largest anti-dam people’s movement, “unprecedented in India’s hydropower history,” refuses to allow dam construction. Activists believe the buildup of a massive opposition in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam may render the Dibang dam a non-starter too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T14:01:34Z","webTitle":"Freakonomics 10 years on: Stephen J Dubner and Steven D Levitt on what they got right and wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview","fields":{"headline":"Freakonomics 10 years on: Stephen J Dubner and Steven D Levitt on what they got right and wrong","bodyText":"Quite soon after the Freakonomics guys, Stephen J Dubner and Steven D Levitt, walk into their office on New York’s Upper West Side for our interview, the scene resolves itself into the kind of well-packaged anecdote with which they love to begin their books. Dubner’s small, wiggly, six-month-old dog, Fifi, is jumping all over me. And I – for some reason feeling like I have to explain the cute behaviour of someone else’s animal – say it’s probably because I smell like my cat. “She’s never met a cat,” says Dubner, the journalist, in his declarative New York accent, “I don’t know if she even knows what a cat is.” “Yes, she does,” says Levitt, the economist, in his softer lisp. “Naturally.” “Does she know what everything smells like?” Dubner asks his colleague, without missing a beat. “Does she know what candy smells like? Just naturally?” Levitt thinks a moment. “I was watching TV last night and they had a dog who could smell … ” “Cancer?” Dubner interrupts. “No, better. It could smell the poop of the orca whale.” Levitt says. “They had been looking for orca poop and … ” “For what purpose?” Dubner interrupts again. “I think for DNA. And they’d only found five in five years.” “Wow,” Dubner says. For a moment I wonder if this scene has been scripted for me. It handily shows three bits of the essence of Freakonomics: how well Dubner and Levitt – whose very successful partnership has now run for a decade, producing four mega-bestselling books and a popular podcast – play off each other; how their interest in the world is so wide-ranging, extending all the way to whale excrement; and how, in their presence, the most mundane observations are vulnerable to the kind of drilling down that might yield some counterintuitive conclusion – even one as casual and tenuous as my remark about my cat. The venue for our meeting is evidence for the wild success of their work: the Freakonomics brand has become the engine of such an enormous amount of activity there is a whole office devoted solely to its promotion. There is even a consultancy associated with it, which features Nobel laureates among its founding partners. And yes, Dubner concedes, it is a brand, or at least “brand-y” – though he says he has wondered, when people call it that, if they are “complimenting or insulting”. A decade after the launch of the first book – and with “-nomics” now as ubiquitous a suffix for a smart way of thinking about something as “-gate” is for a scandal – that question of interpretation is still very much alive. Either way, the two are now as critical to each other’s success as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Their seamless, unflappable routine is built on a certain shared charisma and a sense that they’re joined at the hip. “We’ve never had a fight, ever,” Levitt says early in the interview. “We’ve never had a disagreement on anything.” But that doesn’t quite align with everything they tell me. The Freakonomics origin story suggests things weren’t always quite so smooth. The occasion of their first meeting was straightforward: Dubner had been assigned to write a magazine profile of Levitt. Levitt had already made waves in the press by publishing a paper arguing that legalised abortion had reduced crime rates. As a young professor at the University of Chicago, Levitt had won the Clark medal, a prize given annually by the American Economics Association to the most promising economist under 40. What magazine editors call the “hook” was obvious. Initially, they say, Levitt didn’t like the profile, “’cause [Dubner] lied to me”. A short meet-cute dialogue ensues, detailing exactly how many hours of interviews Levitt had agreed to (two), and exactly how much of his time Dubner actually ended up taking (three days). But regardless of what Levitt thought, the profile was eye-catching enough that Dubner’s literary agent thought they should write a book together. At first they were reluctant. Then, something changed. What was it? “Money,” says Levitt. “Yeah,” says Dubner. I may be imagining this, but he sounds uncertain on my tape. “We both agreed – for some ridiculous amount of money, we were going to write a book. It turned out our amount was very similar,” says Levitt, now evidently trying to convince Dubner of his version of events. Dubner cuts in. “That’s not untrue, but before we got there, we thought, ‘Well, let’s think about what kind of book we want to write … ’” “But way before that,” Levitt interrupts, “we both agreed we didn’t want to do it. We agreed we would prostitute ourselves if they paid enough. And you said, ‘Look, I already read all the papers, I’ve done all the research, I’m ready to write a crappy book that just goes chapter by chapter.’” “That doesn’t sound … I wouldn’t say something like that,” Dubner says. But he agrees that the process of writing the proposal for the book was sometimes taxing, and that trying to write together was, at first, “impossible”. Evidently, they figured it out. The latest addition to their oeuvre provides another measure of their stratospheric success. When to Rob a Bank: A Rogue Economist’s Guide to the World is, basically, a compendium of lightly edited posts from the Freakonomics blog, put out to mark the 10th anniversary. So clear is it that this is just a book for hardcore fans that we barely speak of it in this interview, as if by tacit agreement. The bulk of the posts in the book can be read online for free; nevertheless, their audience is so devoted that they will pay for what Dubner and Levitt have already given them gratis. But the news is not all good. You don’t achieve this kind of success without a few people throwing rocks at you. In recent years, Levitt and Dubner have attracted a number of naysayers. A couple of years ago, Andrew Gelman and Kaiser Fung – fellow “authors of statistics-themed books for general audiences”, in their own words – wrote a long list of nitpicks in the American Scientist. There’s also the journalist Elizabeth Kolbert, who wrote a critique of their second book, SuperFreakonomics, in the New Yorker in which she framed the book as “horseshit”. This doesn’t seem to have had a depressive effect on the metric that, in one calculus, matters most: book sales. But reputationally, something has shifted because of the massive popularity of these books. Polling some random, well-read people of my acquaintance, I hear the following words: “fraud”, “glib”, and “opportunistic”. I find many internet discussion threads in which nearly everyone is scathing about Levitt and Dubner, dismissing them as “Malcolm Gladwell with numbers”. There is, in other words, a certain kind of person who believes themselves to be in the know about Freakonomics, and this insider’s view describes what they do as stupid, crass and cravenly driven by the pursuit of riches. Their back-and-forth about money does suggest that they are not indifferent to the earthly rewards of their work. But their answers to other charges were complicated. Before meeting them, I had assumed what most reviewers do, which is that Levitt is the brains of the operation, so to speak, while Dubner simply smooths out his academic tendencies into readable prose. But watching the two of them have at it, it’s hard not to agree with Levitt’s description of their roles as “blurred”, and of them having a “joint voice”. And Levitt is hardly without opinions of his own. It is he who gets evangelical when I ask him about those academics who are ambivalent about the pair’s popularising of academic work. “When people go into academia, it’s because they want to have ideas heard and read,” Levitt says. “Every academic I know spends far more time than makes sense looking at citations and trying to figure out if anyone’s paying attention.” He has a point, in that even some of Freakonomics’ critics, such as Gelman and Fung in the American Scientist, tend to have a yen for popularising themselves. One particularly stark example: when the first Freakonomics book came out, a law professor (and erstwhile Obama administration official) named Cass Sunstein gave it a lukewarm review in The New Republic. He praised Levitt’s intellectualism overall, but telling readers to look beyond the book’s “slick packaging and stupid title” and its “journalistic gushing”. Within four years of writing that review, though, Sunstein would write a bestselling pop-psychology-and-economics book of his own, called Nudge. In our interview, in fact, Dubner (who drew almost all Sunstein’s ire) names it as one of his favourites of the multiple post-Freakonomics-and-Malcolm-Gladwell genre of books. “We did a lot of those people a big favour,” Levitt adds, when asked about those who wrote copycat books. “I mean, the total sum of book advances for academic economists to write popular books [today] is a vast number. Probably a thousand times the number of books actually sold.” More troubling to both of them are the critics who say they got some things downright wrong. This is most true in the case of a chapter in SuperFreakonomics about climate change. These are the claims that led directly to Kolbert’s “horseshit” metaphor in the New Yorker. They are also the ones that clearly continue to irritate Dubner and Levitt, and they end up taking up half of the interview. Critics take exception to each of the chapter’s three key sections. First, Dubner and Levitt recounted and lightly mocked a prior wave of environmentalist mobilisation around the issue of “global cooling”. Then they suggested that the efforts of environmentalists today to bring down carbon emissions were ultimately hopeless and, in the process, were said to have misdescribed a lot of climate science. They finished by writing about one man’s suggested alternative solution in celebratory tones. That solution amounted to an easily caricatured hose into the sky. An internet storm ensued. Blogposts attacking their conclusions spread. America’s favourite leftist-teddy-bear economist, Paul Krugman, got involved, and wrote that “in this crucial chapter, there’s an average of one statement per page that’s either flatly untrue or deeply misleading”. But when I ask Dubner and Levitt about it, both are extremely dismissive. Levitt is matter of fact: “There was literally nothing wrong about what we said. Everything we said was based on leading scholarship. As far as we know, all that leading scholarship continues to be true. And what people didn’t like about global warming was our conclusions. It had nothing to do with our facts.” Dubner, meanwhile, decides to take a political stance. “Granted, you’re writing for the Guardian, which has a lean against the lean of that particular argument of ours, even though a lot of other leans of ours run right in the pipeline that the Guardian lays out, but … ” He pauses. “The attack on the climate change thing was basically a guy who made up a bunch of stuff, who works for a thinktank, whose agenda is a certain kind of environmental activism. And moreover, this guy was like a principal in a firm that consulted on solar energy. So, no offence, I am not directing this at you, but out of the universe of things that someone could ask about, this is the way it always goes. I can’t think of an interview from the last two years where someone hasn’t said, ‘Well, what about global [warming]?’” But it wasn’t just one guy. Many writers and scientists attacked them, and later Levitt does tell me there are some things in the chapter he’d change. Mostly, though, they aren’t factual. They have to do with the mocking tone that the chapter took at the beginning. “I tell you what we were guilty of, Dubner,” Levitt says to his partner, who has started packing up his things to leave. “Making fun of the fact that, number one, this global cooling thing had happened in the 70s. It happened. But we mocked people for it. We made fun of the environmentalists for getting upset about some other problem that turned out not to be true. “But we didn’t do it with enough reverence, or enough shame and guilt. And I think we pointed out that it’s completely totally and actually much more religion than science. I mean what are you going to do about that? I think that’s just a fact.” By this point, his partner is smiling. Levitt pauses, and says: “Dubner’s laughing at me because he knows I’m just getting us in more trouble.” And you know, he’s probably right. • When to Rob a Bank: A Rogue Economist’s Guide to the World is published by Allen Lane at £14.99.

By contrast, aeroplanes use clunky landing flaps that help channel the air but also waste large amounts of energy. A research team, financed by the EU, has developed a new material that allows aeroplane wings to function more like birds' wings. \"Our prototype shows that it reduces the aeroplane's fuel consumption by 6% thanks to the reduced air resistance\", explains Andreas Lühring, a research scientist at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials (IFAM) in Bremen, which was responsible for developing the new aeroplane wing's \"skin\" - the surface that allows the flaps to move seamlessly. \"And because the material makes the plane lighter, it will consume even less energy.\" What seems so easy for birds is, in fact, an extremely tricky task. \"You have to develop a very particular kind of material that can cope with temperatures of -55C at the plane's cruising altitude, and at such temperatures most materials get stiff,\" explains Lühring. \"But when the plane lands it needs to be flexible.\" Lühring and his colleagues, part of a team of around 50 scientists from 15 European companies, universities and research institutes, found a formula that does the trick: solid materials such as aluminium mixed with soft ones such as silicone and even silicone foam, a very elastic substance that functions much the same as a bath sponge when it's squeezed. The project, called Saritsu (Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures) and coordinated by Airbus, was presented at the Berlin Air Show last month. The team's prototype aeroplane wing will now be tested outside the lab, in real-life aviation settings. If it proves safe, any aircraft manufacturer will be able to use it. The potential impact on the aviation sectors' CO2 emissions is significant. If every aeroplane were to use the bird-like wings, it would cut 42m tonnes from the world's annual aeroplane emissions of 705m tonnes. Another aviation innovation could eventually eliminate the sector's CO2 emissions altogether. Solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse, is fuelled not by petroleum but by solar energy. \"It has unlimited endurance\", explains André Borschberg, Solar Impulse's co-founder. \"It can fly for weeks and months without stopping to fuel because it collects its energy from the sun. The energy it collects during the daylight hours is enough to power it during hours of darkness as well.\" Borschberg, a Swiss businessman, is also a former fighter pilot. Four years ago, he set the record for the world's longest solar-powered flight, when he flew the Solar Impulse I plane for 26 hours straight. The company has now built Solar Impulse 2, which Borschberg and his co-founder Bertrand Piccard plan to pilot around the world in the first-ever circumnavigation by solar aircraft next year. The aeroplane, a single-seater, made its maiden voyage earlier this June. Though it weighs only as much as an average car, it has a 72 metre wingspan, making it wider than a Boeing 747. Most importantly, it features no fuel tank but instead 17,000 solar cells that are built into the wings and supply four electric motors with renewable energy. Zero fossil fuel consumption is, of course, a gigantic aviation leap. But a single-seater plane will hardly make a dent on the aviation business. That, Borschberg explains, is not even the company's intention right now. \"It takes a long time to change things in the aviation business, and of course making a solar jumbojet will take a long time\", he explains. \"Every aspect has to go through many rounds of testing. For now, we want to use the plane as an ambassador for fuel efficiency. If we used energy in this way in different sectors, we could reduce our consumption by 50%.\" The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

The biggest challenge is to leave ideology aside. Plan A has been about austerity – with no economic evidence that it has ever worked, anywhere in the world, in times like the present. We are in a period of massively underutilised capacity, with businesses not cash-strapped but fearful of the future, and hence hoarding money at record levels. ($2 trillion in the US, £800 billion in the UK). Interest rates are at historic lows. What the government should be doing is thinking concretely how to get the investment and innovation machine moving. Austerity doesn't work because when consumers spend less (due to rises in VAT, and cuts in public services and public sector wages – all part of plan A), they consume less, causing business sales to decrease, which of course reduces business investment. And the strategic aspect of business investment fails when there is no bold \"vision\" about areas of innovation. Drugs giant AstraZeneca has cut total UK jobs – including this week in the chancellor's own constituency in Cheshire – and is moving production to countries where there is a more serious life-sciences strategy. The bottom line is that government should not act like a business – spending too much during booms and too little during busts – but counter-cyclically, spending and investing in key strategic areas. And given that such investments create growth, it is just not true, especially in countries with their own currency and active central banks, that for every pound spend there must be a pound cut. The trade-off being announced today as 1% cuts to departments in exchange for £2.5bn capital investment, is a false one. So what must happen? First and foremost, of course, are ailing areas of infrastructure– housing, transport and school-building. But we must also remember that although Keynes talked about recessionary times as ones in which simply \"digging ditches and filling them up again\" would spur growth, there is increasing evidence that the spending multiplier is almost three times higher when government investments are \"directed\". In the 80s and 90s such investments were directed around IT – leading to what became decades of growth related to the internet revolution. Today, the government should be doing the same for green technologies – not only renewables but for all infrastructure spending. Indeed, those countries in Europe that have been growing after the crisis, like Germany, Finland and Denmark, all have a green strategy and are attracting international investments– with China becoming a dynamic collaborator, not just a competitor. A successful budget tomorrow would be one that signals the Treasury understands that investments in human capital, infrastructure and education are essential to growth. That the various attacks on real incomes have hurt consumption, confidence and, worst of all, the social fabric of the country. And that the state's role is not limited to reducing impediments to business investment but increasing their animal spirits. It should be a budget that shows that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills realises that such policies must go beyond patchy boosts to the likes of apprenticeships. While these initiatives have at least revived the industrial strategy debate, they have limited impact not only because they are poorly funded but also because they are riding on false assumptions of what drives investment. Research and development tax credits, or \"patent box\" policies which target income generated from research rather than the research itself (a problem in a country with a below average R&amp;D-to-output ratio), simply cut government tax revenue and don't make R&amp;D happen that would not have happened anyway. Business investment is driven by expectations about where future technological and market opportunities are. In areas like Silicon Valley in the past, and China today, this is about large direct public investments in education, research, technology, as well as publicly funded risk capital going to the most innovative types of businesses, large and small – which are poorly served by a speculative financial system. Such businesses need long-term, courageous and patient capital, exactly what discussions around a British investment bank should be about. Tomorrow's budget could change Britain's future if it steers the country in a green direction, with well-funded infrastructure projects (green schools, green homes and a green transport system) and a plan around green innovation (wind, solar, biofuels). It must open itself to attracting the world's most dynamic people; and most of all it must want whoever lives in Britain to be proud to live in a country which can achieve growth that is not only \"smart\" but also inclusive and sustainable. Come on, George, go for it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2014/aug/18/uk-energy-dependence-five-hidden-costs-fracking","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-18T11:07:37Z","webTitle":"UK energy dependence – five hidden costs expose truth about fracking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/18/uk-energy-dependence-five-hidden-costs-fracking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/18/uk-energy-dependence-five-hidden-costs-fracking","fields":{"headline":"UK energy dependence – five hidden costs expose truth about fracking","bodyText":"The vision of an energy-independent Britain, free of the clear and growing problems of overseas fuel dependency, is deeply alluring. That is one of the reasons I set up a solar energy company 15 years ago. Today, Putin's Russia, Islamic State's Iraq, and a host of other actual and potential fossil-fuel addiction downsides mean we would be well advised to strive hard for that vision. What is becoming clearer with each passing month, however, is that the route to delivering energy independence is not the fracking of domestic gas and oil from shale. Indeed, it could be a route to derailing the vision. Five sets of problems are emerging with the shale narrative: economic risk; local environmental cost; global environmental cost; social cost, and opportunity cost. First, the economic risk. The US \"shale boom\" looks increasingly as though it will turn into one of those bubbles that we humans seem so good at inflating and then bursting. The oil-and-gas industry has been losing cash by the tens of billions, because high drilling costs mean most companies are spending more than they are earning from low-price fracked gas, even when high-price fracked oil is added to the equation. Wider US industry may have benefited from cheap gas in the short term, but production from all shale gas regions – save the Marcellus of Pennsylvania – has peaked already, and many of us reading the detail now see little prospect of the gas industry delivering growing production for many years more. Rather, the reverse. Second, the local environmental cost. Once Dick Cheney freed fracking from scrutiny under America's Safe Drinking Water Act (the so-called \"Halliburton Loophole\"), back in the kick-off days for shale in the Bush years, bad news about contamination and health impacts should have been predictable. It has been slow to emerge, in part because of widespread use of gagging orders by the industry as part of compensation payments for wrecked farms and impaired health. But now a regular drip of bad news has started, soon likely to snowball as ever more people realise the reality behind the industry's mantras about all being well. Third, the global environmental cost. Gas industry operations can and do leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from wellhead to hob. The question is, how much? Early research on fracking-related emissions by the rare university teams not cowed by oil-industry funding are worrying. Fracked gas may well prove to be worse than coal in greenhouse terms, over the full-life-cycle. And British shale basins are far more faulted than US shale basins. Fourth, the social cost. It is likely that few British people as yet fully appreciate the tight well spacings, industrial infrastructure, water profligacy, toxic waste-disposal challenges, and lorry movements that are required for a typical US shale \"sweet spot\", and what the social cost of that would be if superimposed on rural Britain. Yet already local opposition is severe, even against single vertical unfracked test wells, which entail little waste, and few lorry movements. Planning for the first such was rejected by a council for the first time recently, in Sussex, with objectors \"weeping with relief\" in the chamber on hearing the decision. Many such objectors are Conservative voters. The prime minister says he wants to deliver sufficient shale gas to drive down the gas price so far that large-scale manufacturing returns to the UK. He has little or no chance of getting that past his own voter base without committing political suicide, even if much of that gas proves extractable by fracking – which the British Geological Survey clearly has doubts about. Fifth, the opportunity cost. There is a shovel-ready alternative to gas that can be developed surprisingly quickly, given the collective will: renewable energy and energy efficiency. Among this broad family is a star duo that the energy incumbency increasingly fears as an existential threat: solar and storage. Solar is a power source that is infinite and easy to tap, as opposed to finite and increasingly difficult to tap. Politically, the government's own opinion polls show that solar is outstandingly the most popular energy technology with the British public, year after year, miles ahead of fracking, even now, so early in the game. In the most recent poll, for DECC itself, support for fracking was down at just 24%. The opportunity cost is that many leaders in the oil and gas industry, and their supporters in government, want actively to suppress this fast-growing global industry, with its fast-falling cost base – along with all the other clean-energy industries – so as to not put investors in gas off. The fact that the oil-and-gas incumbency views solar as such a threat to their business models should tell us everything we need to know. • Jeremy Leggett is the founding chairman of Solarcentury, the UK's largest solar solutions company, and charity SolarAid.

In that time, marine energy has gone from pipe dream to potential saviour of the planet. Recent reports claim it could provide as much as 32% of the UK’s electricity, contribute £6.61bn to the UK economy by 2035 and create more than 23,000 jobs. The amount of energy the UK can derive from its oceans has increased 20-fold since 2007: the installed capacity in 2007 was 0.5MW; in 2014 it hit 10MW. And the Crown Estate, which is responsible for granting permission for any projects involving the sea or the seabed, has leased more than 40 sites for future marine energy development. The journey has not been easy, and it is far from over. Fraenkel likens the industry’s hard-fought ascent to walking in the Lake District: “You see a summit up ahead and you reach it thinking maybe that’s the top, and then you look and there’s another one, 300 metres further on, and then another one, and then another one.” There are still many summits to climb before the marine energy sector reaches its full potential in the UK. The technology to create energy from waves and tides has been proven but will enough initial investment ever be found for the sector to become commercially viable? Fraenkel got involved in tidal energy in 1990, working for a firm called IT Power. When IT Power’s board decided in 2000 that there was no future in tidal energy, he found himself in a difficult position. “I had the choice of giving it up or going ahead and doing it on my own, so I left IT Power and went full-time into my own company, Marine Current Turbines. It was a bit of a gamble, but it came off. We didn’t have any money until 2002, but in 2002 we managed to raise the money and we had a turbine in the water in 2003.” Marine Current Turbines was subsequently bought out by manufacturing giant Siemens in 2011, but Fraenkel has no regrets on that score. He says the entry of multinationals is the only way the industry will ever reach its full potential. The money needed in the next stage is big – £50m-100m per project – and so it needs bigger players to get involved. Britain is uniquely positioned to take advantage of marine energy. The world’s strongest waves are found in the temperate climates north and south of the tropics, as this is where the wind and wave and tidal streams are at their strongest. “Britain is very exposed to the waves that come in across the Atlantic and wind and waves from the west and south west. And because we are an island nation, the tidal flows scoot around our coastlines constantly, making us exceptionally well-placed from a tidal perspective,” explains Martin Murphy, managing director of Wales-based Tidal Energy Ltd. Only a few other regions – Japan and Korea , the north coast of Spain, parts of Canada – are as well-placed. There is some good news for British marine techology. The MeyGen Project in Orkney recently secured £51.3m of funding to install four 1.5MW turbines in the Pentland Firth. The 6MW that will be produced in MeyGen’s first phase will be enough to power approximately 3,000 houses. The end goal for MeyGen is to install 269 turbines, enough to provide 50% of Scotland’s electricity needs, but that goal is many funding rounds away. Dee Nunn, wave and tidal development manager for Renewables UK, says she was “elated” when she heard that MeyGen had secured funding for its initial phase. But, she adds, “We’re not out of the woods yet. It’s fantastic that MeyGen have got their project underway, but there still needs to be support for the sector to get it to the point where it is fully commercial. What the investors need to see is a really significant size for the market, and at the moment that is being constrained by the government, because we can’t see what their support will be beyond 2019.” In September, MeyGen signed a 10-year power purchase agreement worth up to £50m with independent energy firm SmartestEnergy. Each year the government announces its support for renewables for the next five years. That means today’s investors can only be sure of a return on their investment up until 2019. “Getting the money has always been the biggest problem,” says Fraenkel. “Nobody will invest £50-100m in a project which is only going to last five years. They want to invest for 25 years. If there is no confidence as to what it will earn in six years’ time, you can’t get any money. It’s as simple as that.” The marine industry is, as a result, dependent on government support. It’s only when the industry reaches a certain size that the price per kilowatt hour will come down. The price of wind energy is a quarter of what it once was, and the cost of solar energy seems to fall almost daily. Marine energy could in time be as cheap, or even cheaper, than energy from the wind and the sun, but will need help getting off ground. But why bother if wind and solar are already doing the job so well? Energy from wind and solar is intermittent: they require the wind to blow, or the sun to shine. But the tide comes and goes out twice a day. Waves, though not constant or entirely predictable, are at least regular and frequent. The other major obstacle is grid connection – the grid is not well-developed in the remote areas where marine energy is sourced. Nunn describes this as a “chicken and egg situation: the projects need the grid connection and the people responsible for the grid connection don’t want to build until the projects are in place”. And once again, it’s going to require a substantial amount of initial investment. Yet fossil fuels are already subsidised to the tune of £3.63bn a year (based on 2010 figures) while marine energy received just £180m between 2002 and 2011. As Fraenkel says: “Given what the government spends, the amount of money needed to really push marine renewables forward is peanuts. They talk about bank bailouts of £70-80bn – well, half a billion would be pretty good for marine renewables.” Siemens is a funding partner of the Big Energy Debate project.

The first is an environmentalist’s dream. Rooftop gardens, pedestrian bridges with solar panels, easy access to public transit, the use of reclaimed wood and water, and other features that allow complete power generation via solar energy. This is San Francisco’s Levi’s Stadium, which is the first NFL stadium to achieve the elite LEED Gold status for new construction. The second is a bird-lover’s nightmare. Despite state regulations and immense pressure from the Audubon Society and local officials, the new Minnesota Vikings stadium, built by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, plans to utilize non-bird-safe glass, which is also less energy efficient. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Here’s how each building got to where it is. Minnesota Vikings Stadium in Minneapolis Funding was approved in May 2012 for a $1bn facility to replace Minneapolis’s aging Metrodome. Large parts of now-demolished Metrodome are in the process of being recycled, including 25 tons of precious metals and 80% of the facility’s steel and concrete. The new stadium will be LEED-certified, with one of the most efficient roof structures in the nation, efficient LED lighting and daylighting controls that will reduce energy use from lighting by nearly 30%, and water efficient irrigation systems that will cut landscape irrigation in half, according to an email from Michele Kelm-Helgen, chair of the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority. But the main issue being argued here is bird safety. In May 2013, the Audubon Society entered talks with the Minnesota Vikings and the MSFA after noticing the newly revealed stadium designs for the new stadium, set to open in 2016, didn’t use bird-safe glass. When flying, birds can’t see glass and mistake reflections in the glass for an actual destination. The result is a nasty collision that can be fatal for the bird. Bird-safe glass, such as Arnold Glas’s Ornilux, adds a patterned, UV-reflective coating. This allows the glass to remain clear to the human eye, but birds can see the pattern and avoid the building. The special glass would also help keep the building cool and save on air-conditioning energy. The Audubon Society worked the MSFA until April. On 17 July, the group was told that the glass would not be changed. Frustrated, the Audubon Society issued a scathing news release in late July condemning the MSFA for its actions, urging it and the Vikings to keep the stadium from becoming a “death trap.” The Minneapolis City Council threw its weight behind the nonprofit as well, spearheading a petition that has collected more than 76,000 signatures. MSFA deemed the glass too expensive. “And yet, the Vikings recently found a way to spend more than $1m on an upscale ‘preview center’ and $1.3m for ‘design features’ related to TVs and escalators,” Audubon Minnesota executive director Matthew Anderson said in a news release. The MSFA maintains that it does not have the $1.1m needed to install bird-safe glass, and that Minnesota guidelines regarding bird-safe glass were issued prior to the stadium’s plans being finalized. Stadium officials said they have incorporated all of the society’s other recommended measures to keep birds safe into its design, including the “Lights Out” program that keeps the lights off in the middle of the night during bird-migration periods. “The Audubon Society approached us [about the fritted glass] after our design was complete,” Kelm-Helgen wrote. “We had worked for over a year with local stakeholders to ensure our stadium was open, transparent and connected to the neighborhoods surrounding it. The transparent glass on the west side of the stadium is key to that design.” Agatha Szczepaniak with the National Audubon Society said that there hasn’t been any progress regarding bird-safe glass at the Vikings stadium since the Minneapolis City Council passed its resolution. 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium in San Francisco, California Right from the drawing board, the San Francisco 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium was designed to be sustainable as well as high-tech. The crowning feature is a solar panel-ladened “green roof” atop the suite tower. That roof, along with power generated from solar panels on three pedestrian walkways, will offset the power the team uses during home games. The owners’ suite is crafted from reclaimed wood from a nearby airfield. The stadium recycles 85% of its water. This netted LEED Gold status for the stadium (which opened in July), the announcement coming just days after the Audubon Society learned that the Minnesota Vikings wouldn’t utilize bird-safe glass in its new stadium. The 49ers join a rare group of professional sports teams committing to sustainable activities. The Baltimore Ravens have the only other NFL stadium granted LEED Gold status. It became the first last year, when the team remodeled M&amp;T Bank Stadium. The National Hockey League isn’t far behind. The NHL issued a sustainability report in late July, outlining what the league has done to help the environment and pledging to work with teams to craft sustainability goals. The New York Islanders are expected to move to Brooklyn’s Barclays Center in 2015, which has LEED Silver status. An arena under construction in Edmonton, Canada, also is expected to receive LEED Silver.

Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm Age: about five years Location: Ipswich Why it started: “The farm was very much a coming together of two questions, can we produce food and can we run a low-carbon farm?” explains founder Joanne Mudhar. “I’d had one allotment, then two allotments and then a small holding in France, so when 12 acres came available just on the edge of Ipswich, I had to go for it.” But she soon realised there was far too much to manage on her own. Her community came together to help, and the land soon developed into a community farm, with everyone buying shares and enjoying the spoils from the land: “The farm is 12 acres, so technically it’s a small holding but we call it a farm because it’s easier.” How many people are involved? There are 55 households involved in the scheme – around 150 people in total. “We get up to 30 people coming to work on the days when we do intensive farming, and it is incredible the amount of work you can get done with that number of people,” explains Mudhar. “Some of these people had no experience of farming whatsoever until recently, and now one person who worked here went on to study horticulture – it’s inspiring!” Does the group get funding? When Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm started, Mudhar paid for most of the equipment herself. The farm then received £10,000 from the Big Lottery Fund and £20,000 from the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation for running costs. “Both grants were used with the very definite aim of being able to grow membership enough to enable the farm to become financially self sufficient,” explains Joanne. The farm is now entirely self-funded by the members who pay £8 per week to receive an equal share of all the vegetables grown on the farm. This will increase to £8.50 per week from June 2015. What would they like to do next? The group are looking into solar energy. They would also like to build a low-key kitchen on the farm to run more cookery-based classes with the produce, as well as setting up a welcome centre. “At the moment we just have a polytunnel and a plastic sheet – it isn’t very welcoming to visitors!” What can you do to help? Volunteers need to be members of our Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme but friends and family of CSA members are welcome to accompany members on the farm. From 27 September 2014 the farm will be recruiting for more members to be involved in the veg box scheme. Can I set something like this up in my area? There may already be a CSA near you; ou can use the Soil Association’s map of CSAs around the country to find one in your area. The Soil Association has masses of incredibly useful information for setting up your own community supported agriculture (CSA) project: They have an action manual full of advice on CSA; from the different models and routes to take through to financial, legal and land issues. View and download it here There are also numerous short films profiling established CSA projects around the country There is a range of funding models depending on your set-up, which you can find here. If you are a rural community the Plunkett Foundation is also an excellent source of support and a good place to start “There’s an increasing amount of support available for those interested in setting up a community project and lots of great case studies for inspiration,” says Colleen McCulloch, the Soil Association’s agricultural development manager. “If you’re not lucky first time don’t be put off – use it as a chance to hone your idea and try again.” You can also visit Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm to see how it’s done. The annual farm tour will take place on Saturday 27 September (£5 per adult), or you can organise a visit on another day by visiting our website (please note there is a charge for visits). “You need as much practical experience as possible,” warns Mudhar. Her advice: “Volunteer and get involved with as many similar projects as you can find and don’t be afraid. Just don’t jump into it too quickly. Sometimes I think to myself: ‘Well this was a very daft idea, Joanne!’ but you know what ... It’s turned out OK.” The projects in this series: 1. The community supported farm 2.

The stage of New York’s Madison Square Garden was filled with dancers in traditional dress, while a laser show and holograms of historical Indian figures lit up the backdrop. Shots of rising skyscrapers, microchip factories and Asia’s largest solar-energy plant were framed by balloons in the colours of the Indian and US flags. When Narendra Modi, the new prime minister of India, took to the stage on Sunday night, he told the wildly enthusiastic audience that the 21st century would belong to Asia, and possibly to his own nation. “Some say, this is India’s century. India has the potential … The time has come. India is the world’s youngest country and its most ancient culture. [It] has something that other countries in the world don’t,” Modi told the sellout crowd of 20,000 at an event which many see as the highlight of the 64-year-old politician’s five-day US visit. Speaking in Hindi, and using some phrases familiar from this year’s long election campaign, Modi spoke of his ambitions for India, where economic growth has flagged in recent years. The organisers, the Indian American Community Foundation, had seized the opportunity to showcase the Indian-American community. There are 2.8 million Indian Americans, forming one of the wealthiest and best-educated diaspora communities in the US. Many became involved in Modi’s election campaign. Performers included the aspiring pop singer Anjali Ranadive, while Nina Davuluri, who became the first Indian American to win the Miss America competition in 2013, was a host. “It means a lot to me to be able to represent Indian Americans. [Modi] is the first of his generation to be the prime minister and so many changes are going to come. It is such a rich culture … Indians are so full of life.,” Ranadive told NDTV, an Indian TV channel. Modi won a crushing victory in the polls in May, gaining his Bharatiya Janata party the first clear majority in Indian politics for 30 years and raising hopes for wholesale reform in a country still troubled by poor infrastructure, red tape, deep poverty and weak governance. Since then, business confidence and the stock market have surged. A former tea seller from a poor family in the western state of Gujarat, Modi entered politics after spending years as an organiser with right wing religious organisations. He has described himself as a Hindu nationalist and a patriot. (http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/07/12/interview-with-bjp-leader-narendra-modi/) However he won power campaigning on a development agenda and focused much of his speech last night on the economic potential of India, his desire to reform government and to improve sanitation. Modi appealed directly for the diaspora to help him clean the Ganges, the heavily polluted river sacred to Hindus. Modi received rapturous applause for saying that when people asked him for a “big vision” he replied that he was only a “small man” who started out selling tea. More than 40 US congressmen were present to watch the speech, which was relayed on a giant screen in Times Square. Local authorities had laid on extra public transport for the expected crowds. Earlier in the day Modi appeared at the Global Citizen festival in Central Park, attended by an estimated 60,000 people. He said his hope was that India’s 800 million young people could transform the nation. “To put the light of hope in every eye. And the joy of belief in every heart. Lift people out of poverty. Put clean water and sanitation within the reach of all. Make healthcare available to all. A roof over every head,” he said. Last week India became the first nation to put a satellite into the orbit of Mars on its first attempt, and the first Asian nation to do so at all. But not all were won over by Modi’s Madison Square event. Vinod Mehta, a well-known Indian commentator, described it as “over the top”. “He has only been in power for 100 days. There is a personality cult that is being built up and the fervour is quite frightening,” Mehta said. Amit Kumar, 31, a taxi driver in south Delhi, watched much of the speech in a tea stall near Nizamuddin station and disagreed. “He is a very strong man. There they are showing much respect for India. That is his achievement.” On Monday Modi will head to Washington for meetings with the heads of 17 multinationals, including Google, Boeing, IBM, PepsiCo and MasterCard, and a private dinner with Barack Obama. This will be a frugal meal as Modi will be fasting for the annual Hindu religious festival of Navratri. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this weekend Modi described the US as India’s “natural partner”. But relations have been rocky. In 2005 Modi was denied a visa to the US under a 1998 law barring entry to foreigners who have committed “particularly severe violations of religious freedom”. The decision followed accusations that he had stood by during, or even encouraged, sectarian violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed by rioters. Modi has denied all wrongdoing and India’s supreme court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to back the charges against him. On Sunday night he made an oblique, jocular reference to the affair, saying he understood when fellow Indians complained of problems obtaining a visa. The UK ended its boycott of Modi in 2012. The EU swiftly followed, with the US ambassador only meeting the prime ministerial candidate for the first time earlier this year. On the eve of Modi’s visit, an activist group in the US filed a lawsuit on behalf of three survivors of the violence that accuses the Indian leader of attempted genocide, and there were small protests outside the venue last night. After an improvement a decade ago, and a controversial nuclear deal, relations between Delhi and Washington hit a low last year when the Indian deputy consul general in the US was arrested on suspicion of visa fraud in New York, strip-searched and held in police custody. The affair prompted a vitriolic reaction in India to what was seen as disrespectful bullying, leading to accusations in the US of oversensitivity and behaviour unbecoming of an aspirant future power. Since then Washington has mounted a charm offensive, said Michael Kugelman, a south Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre in Washington. “For Washington, and for Obama specifically, it’s really about simply getting to know someone they don’t know much about. The relationship has hit rock bottom so the only way is up. Everyone is looking for some good news out of this,” Kugelman said last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/oct/30/coal-solar-power-india-electricity-villages-mining-narendra-modi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-30T20:03:50Z","webTitle":"Will coal or solar power fuel India’s drive to bring electricity to its villages?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/coal-solar-power-india-electricity-villages-mining-narendra-modi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/oct/30/coal-solar-power-india-electricity-villages-mining-narendra-modi","fields":{"headline":"Will coal or solar power fuel India’s drive to bring electricity to its villages?","bodyText":"The village of Geer in Madhya Pradesh is about to undergo the simplest of revolutions. After 25 years of being told electricity is coming, it is finally here. “After sunset we can’t do anything so we sit in the darkness. The children cannot study. We go to bed early,” says Chotelal Gupta, who runs the nearest thing Geer has to a shop. It is no more than a cupboard really, selling sweets and biscuits. But in the last few weeks Gupta has started to stock lightbulbs as the villagers wire up their homes. A small crowd of villagers stand around the transformer for the big switch-on. This is India, where no such moment can happen without a few prayers, the breaking of a coconut and the burning of incense. In the absence of a local dignitary they turn to me to do the honours. It reminds me of my wedding; I had no idea what was going on then either. Almost immediately people rush for Gupta’s home. He has bought an old TV and connected what looks like a saucepan lid on a stick, but it is, I am assured, a satellite dish. The kids are furiously trying to find a signal. They are clearly very bright and the arrival of a mobile signal and the internet will obviously transform their lives before long. Gupta also has plans for an electric pump to irrigate his land. That could make the difference between growing enough rice and lentils to eat and producing enough to sell. There are, according to the World Bank, around 400 million Indians waiting for electricity. The new prime minister, Narendra Modi, has pledged to connect them all within five years and plans to do so with an unprecedented dash for coal. India has the fifth largest deposits in the world but has not been mining them, so coal-fired power stations import about a third of their supply. The government has made it clear that has to change, but is being frustrated by a combination of environmental protest, court battles over corruption and the constitutional rights of tribal communities who claim mines threaten their livelihoods. Among the companies trying to deliver Modi’s vision is Mahan Coal, jointly owned by British-registered Essar Energy and Indian corporate giant Hindalco. Chief executive Ramakant Tiwari has spent seven years battling to get permission to begin a vast opencast mine in a section of the Mahan forest. It is one of the last natural forests left in Madhya Pradesh and breathtakingly beautiful. But as we stand on a hill surveying the area Mahan Coal plans to dig, Tiwari insists he will make it even better. “Do you not feel bad, destroying a forest and turning it into a vast scar on the landscape?” I ask. “We are not destroying anything. We are just taking the old trees which have become coal and planting new trees for the future,” he insists. Tiwari, who looks and sounds more like a charity worker than a mining boss, sells it as part of the natural cycle of human development. He wants to show me the kind of mine he would build, so we take a drive to a government-owned site nearby. The area has been dubbed the nation’s energy capital and is home to several mines and power stations supplying the grid in north and central India. As we scramble up the verge from the road and peer over the side, my involuntary response is a startled “wow”. For more than a kilometre in each direction the land is dug out into terraces exposing long seams of black coal. There are no people to be seen, just vast futuristic machines eating up the earth and carrying it away. A blast half a kilometre away doesn’t just make a frightening noise; the ground shakes and we nearly fall over. All around us are towering mountains of waste, huge brown piles of earth and rock, which Tiwari assures me will one day be thick with trees and vegetation. The villagers living next to the mines see things differently. In Chilika Daad, they are sick and tired of the blasting and the dust. They say the promises they were given of development, investment and jobs were broken and all they have are homes they can’t sell and lives they can’t change. The area is rated the third most polluted place in India due to emissions from the power plants and dust from the coal mines, and everywhere you go people claim their health is being affected by it. At the school in Chilika Daad, the headteacher says that “this is no place for children to live”. Her pupils suffer from coughs and breathing problems. Out of 209 pupils, 70 are off sick that day and she warns me not to assume that is normal for poorer parts of India. People want education, she explains, so they only stay away if they have to. Word of these problems has spread to the tribal communities living around the planned Mahan Coal mine. The villagers are deeply divided between those who want the employment and compensation that a mine could bring and those who want none of it. Mahan Coal is up against determined opposition, with Greenpeace heavily involved in training local leaders to campaign against the mine. Tribal communities have constitutional rights that mean, if they can prove they rely on the land and have a claim on it, they can in theory stop the mine. In 36C heat and 80% humidity, a group of them walk me through the Mahan forest, gathering food and medicinal plants. The women dash from tree to bush, telling me all about the benefits of each one. “But how can you not want a television and a fridge? Or air conditioning in this heat?”, I ask. The women cackle with amusement. “Do you not feel the breeze of natural air conditioning? Why do I need a fridge when I can pick what I need to eat fresh every day?” says Phoolmati. “And we have all the entertainment we need here without a television”. Unlike Gupta, with his makeshift satellite dish and plans for a fridge from which to sell soft drinks, all Phoolmati can visualise is how the mine is going to ruin her life and environment. She is committed to fighting the development at every turn. Their campaign has been helped by an entirely separate ruling by India’s supreme court. It recently dealt the miners a massive blow, throwing out more than 200 coal allocations awarded by previous governments because of allegations of corruption. That has stopped Mahan Coal in its tracks, with the chief executive admitting: “We cannot say with any degree of certainty about the course of action.” A new process of auctioning off the coal blocks is about to begin and the company will now have to decide whether to bid again for its allocation. They have been told they won’t have to go back to the beginning of the environmental process but they will also know that if they win the auction and pay out once again there is still no guarantee they will be able to go ahead with the mine. Greenpeace argues the future should be about renewables, including solar energy. That may, in the end, have to be where the government heads: but for now the prime minister’s promise to electrify every village in five years is looking vulnerable.

But only a tiny amount of that trickled down to where it is needed the most – to provide power to the two billion people without access to energy. The UN's goal of universal access to modern energy by 2030 will require an annual investment of up to $41bn a year. Progress to date has been slow, to say the least. Over the past year, a new model has emerged which blends the crowdfunding entrepreneurship of Kickstarter with the social enterprise of Kiva. Ryan Levinson conceived of SunFunder, an off-grid solar finance company, during a trip to South East Asia after quitting his job at a US bank. During this trip he began to hear repeated stories about lack of access to capital to fund solar projects. \"With my background in energy finance on US solar energy projects I could see how access to finance can really open up the market,\" he said. \"Financing is a challenge for the clean energy industry all over the world but there are regions without electricity that are best suited to distributed solar power. But who is going to finance this transformation of a market where 1.3 billion people have limited or no access to electricity? \"I really believe that solar can leapfrog the grid over the next decade or two the same way cellphones were able to leapfrog landlines in developing countries. But it's going to require a lot of capital - we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars and there doesn't seem to be any company that specialises in this emerging sector.\" In May 2011, Levinson left his job at Wells Fargo, where he oversaw $500m in financing for commercial-sized projects in the US. A little over a year after SunFunder was founded in the summer of 2012, it has fully financed 10 projects in Uganda, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya and the Philippines. Some of the financing is small – between £4,000 and £25,000 – but the impact is often large. Solar photovoltaic panel costs have reduced by 60% over the past two years, making PV technology more economically competitive than ever before, particularly in remote locations in the developing world that would never be reached by the grid or have to rely on diesel generation. \"For the first time, solar energy can be affordable economically for people all over the world and often with no subsidies,\" said Levinson. \"That really struck me having worked in more developed markets where there is a large solar energy industry dependent on subsidies. This was an enormous opportunity to solve such a big problem – it seemed like a perfect time and I felt like my background lent itself well to creating a company dedicated to solving this problem.\" Earlier this month, SunFunder announced a milestone with the full repayment within a year of its first loan for a SunnyMoney project in Zambia. But that milestone was not just significant for the San Francisco-based startup and the social enterprise division of London-based charity SolarAid. Levinson said that every project that crosses the 100% repayment line brings off-grid solar finance a step closer to bankability. Scale is one of the main objectives of SunFunder, which aims to invest $1bn by 2020. To reach those volumes, the involvement of large international finance institutions like the World Bank, government entities and foundations will be essential. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly $1tn in cumulative investment will be required to achieve universal energy access by 2030. While rows continue over energy price hikes in the UK, the proportion of a family's income spent on kerosene, candles, batteries and diesel generators in the developing world is much higher. In addition to the financial burden, the costs to human health are also high, with an estimated two million deaths a year associated with the burning of solid fuels indoors in unventilated kitchens. Women and children are most affected. Though Levinson does not like to use the kerosene parity comparison, he acknowledges the financial burden on poor families. \"The point is that on both a per unit of energy basis and as a percentage of income, people pay way more for energy in off-grid communities, and often this is for very poor quality energy that brings a number of negative impacts,\" he said. Solar systems even of a small size increase productivity levels for work and study, respiratory disorders often subside, while savings from the freedom from kerosene are significant. Increased connectivity through access to cellular phones and the internet is also a powerful tool to unlock economic growth and can only be achieved with stable supplies of electricity. \"People often use kerosene as their primary source of light and at the same time you have 600 million people in the world with cellphones and no good way or affordable way of charging those cellphones,\" said Levinson. \"It's not just about access to electricity it's also about access to connectivity and information which in our world is increasingly important.\" Earlier this year, SunFunder launched a new partnership with Fenix International, a Silicon Valley renewable energy company that designs and manufactures mobile phone charging systems for emerging markets. In March, SunFunder won the Facebook Cleantech Goes Social contest and a $25,000 prize to develop an app that will connect crowdfunding investors with end-users who benefit from solar projects. SunFunder will also launch social gift cards through Facebook's internet.org initiative, which aims to make the internet available to the two-thirds of the world population not yet connected. So far, SunFunder has raised $150,000 from more than 590 people in 37 countries. Securities and Exchange Commission rules allow crowdfunders to participate outside the US but restrict returns to a \"dividend\" that is put back into an evergreen fund. SunFunder also recently closed an issuance of Solar Empowerment Notes that raised $250,000 from four accredited investors. \"For us, it's about a diversity of sources of funding,\" said Levinson. \"Crowd funding has been great and it's a big part of who we are and we're going to stay committed to it. But we're also raising capital from private investors to fund projects and it's a big part of our strategy going forward. We wouldn't have been able to do that if we were not able to show through crowdfunding that this works. Crowdfunding is proving that this is a bankable sector. But we're not going to limit ourselves to the crowd.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/30/uk-solar-farm-subsidies-cut-panels-buildings","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-30T09:47:13Z","webTitle":"UK solar farm subsidies to be cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/30/uk-solar-farm-subsidies-cut-panels-buildings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/30/uk-solar-farm-subsidies-cut-panels-buildings","fields":{"headline":"UK solar farm subsidies to be cut","bodyText":"Subsidies paid to solar farms in the UK will come under review by ministers within weeks, Whitehall sources have told the Guardian. There are around 200 solar photovoltaic farms around the UK, whose owners are paid thousands of pounds under the renewable obligation scheme. The payments are levied from household energy bills. Solar farms have proven controversial in some individual cases, with a councillor in Devon likening them to concentration camps and comedian Griff Rhys Jones fighting a high-profile campaign against one outside Ipswich, but government polling shows it is one of the most popular energy technologies, with around 80% public support. Payments are expected to be cut for the larger ground-mounted schemes that have been built on farmland, former airfields and other sites. \"We don't want the whole solar sector damaged by a few solar farms that communities don't want,\" a Whitehall source told the Guardian. Greg Barker, the climate minister, was reported by the Daily Mail as wanting to cut the payments. Barker, announcing the government's solar strategy earlier this month, told the Guardian: \"I do not want solar farms to become the new onshore wind. I do not want to see unrestricted growth of solar farms in the British countryside.\" The government is understood to favour prioritising solar panels on buildings, such as factories and supermarkets. Building-mounted systems currently receive slightly higher payments (1.7 renewable obligation certificates per megwatt hour) than ground-mounted ones (1.6 ROC/mWh). But the Guardian has been told that the \"overall level of support for solar will stay the same\", which could suggest the payments for solar on the ground will go down and those for panels on buildings will go up. A consultation will be announced within weeks. The solar industry said it was disappointed by the prospect of a review. Nick Boyle, CEO of Lightsource Renewable Energy, one of the UK's biggest solar developers, said: \"The UK solar industry should be congratulated for its outstanding achievements in the first quarter of 2014, but instead we find ourselves having to justify our very existence. Solar installations are an asset to Britain and should be held up as a beacon of home grown electricity generation, but constant tariff cuts and government pressure act to undermine the work we do to provide clean, secure energy and put into serious question the very momentum we have worked so hard to build.\" Friends of the Earth's energy campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: \"Yet another badly handled review could spook investors and bring uncertainty to Britain's solar sector. Solar power is hugely popular and is on course to be one of our cheapest forms of energy, but it needs robust and predictable support to enable it to thrive and further reduce its costs.\" Seb Berry, head of public affairs at Solarcentury, a major solar energy company, said: \"It goes without saying that any move to change the renewable obligation from 2015 will have significant commercial consequences for this sector because of the long time-frame for large-scale projects. The truly nightmare scenario of a possible change to the RO before April 2015 would be a commercial disaster for the entire industry and certainly open up Decc [the Department of Energy and Climate Change] to the prospect of legal challenge.\" On Wednesday, a report from the trade body the Renewable Energy Association said that the renewable energy industry, which also includes wind power, employs around 103,000 people, though the number marks a fall of around 7,000 since 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/fashion-technology-renewable-energy-solar-charge-smartphone","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-04T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Fashion meets renewable energy – clothes that charge your smartphone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/fashion-technology-renewable-energy-solar-charge-smartphone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/fashion-technology-renewable-energy-solar-charge-smartphone","fields":{"headline":"Fashion meets renewable energy – clothes that charge your smartphone","bodyText":"When you think about how fashion will work alongside technology in the future, it might be hard to break from science-fiction-heavy ideas. However, fashionably using solar, wind and even kinetic energy to charge devices, keep us connected and even donate our energy to non-profits is being explored by a number of design houses. Solar textiles Meg Grant, of Solar Fiber, says she and co-collaborators Aniela Hoitink, Marina Toeters, Ralf Jacobs, and Professor Derek Schlettwein from Giessen University are already pushing the textile boundaries in terms of solar fibres. \"If you look around you, textiles cover so many surfaces, so why not give them a 'super power' that can take advantage of this, like solar energy harvesting,\" says Grant. The idea behind Solar Fiber is a flexible photovoltaic fibre that converts sunlight energy into electrical energy via a yarn that can be worked into all sorts of fabrics. Its latest prototype is the solar shawl which displays the amount of energy being generated in real-time. Grant says the project is 100% part-time, voluntary and open-source and prototypes are currently only capable of generating tiny amounts of energy. \"We are open-source because we believe that this kind of technology could be so game-changing that it should be in the public domain,\" says Grant. After graduating from ArtEZ Institute of the Arts in Arnhem, the Netherlands in 2010, Pauline van Dongen started her own womenswear label. Working with companies from the fields of science and innovation, van Dongen aims to merge fashion and technology and like Grant, her focus is on solar textiles. She and her team call it Wearable Solar, clothing that gives people an opportunity to generate sustainable energy through what they wear and charge their tech on the go. The Wearable Solar collection currently consists of two designs, a coat and a dress made of wool and leather, which produce energy through their integrated solar cells. The coat incorporates 48 rigid solar cells and the dress has 72 flexible solar cells. When worn in full sun for two hours, both garments can generate enough energy to allow a typical smartphone to be 100% charged. The solar cell compartments can be opened and revealed to the sun when needed and folded back when they are not being used. \"Wearable Solar is a sustainable answer to our increasing demand for energy and connectivity, while also anticipating the vastly expanding wearable technology market,\" says van Dongen. Kinetic energy Professor Rebeccah Pailes-Friedman is a designer and author of Designing With Smart Textiles, due to be published in 2015. She says, \"If you think about what traditional fashion is, it's such a small part of the real world, but then when you look at performance fashion, clothing that has to do something, you see a much larger part of the population using them.\" Pailes-Friedman focuses her research on light and movement in smart textiles. \"Really good design is when you don't notice it. We have always lived and worked in clothing so we know how it functions, 98% of how we wear it is no mystery to us so technology being incorporated needs to be part of and as intuitive as our clothing.\" An example of this seamless design might be kinetic energy, where movement generates energy. Energy harvesting Last winter, Damon Ahola, a recent graduate of the School of Visual Arts, MFA in Products of Design, was running on a treadmill at the gym watching people bobbing up and down on ellipticals, stair masters and bikes. \"I thought we were all exerting a huge amount of energy while at the same time consuming a vast amount of electrical energy.\" His gym observation led him to question how to take advantage of kinetic energy through a project called Harvest which investigated the potential of integrating energy harvesting into our lives. Ahola said he began by approaching the work from a user-centric point of view, initially exploring what activities are appropriate for energy harvesting. In the case of Harvest, a user's daily movement is transformed into quantifiable energy through an electromagnetic process. Energy is stored to a micro rechargeable lithium-ion battery called a pod that is embedded in footwear, attached to bicycles or kept in the pockets of clothes. The energy is stored to the Harvest pod battery and the user can plug it into their smartphone to check his or her metrics using the Harvest app. Though only a concept at this point, the future of Harvest is that it would partner with footwear, apparel and bicycle companies. The Harvest user can upload their energy by visiting \"harvest hotspots\", which utilise the existing infrastructure of the square payment kiosk system, and the harvested energy is transferred and stored to a green energy bank. Once enough energy is accumulated, a renewable energy certificate is created. The certificate is then sold on the energy market and the proceeds are donated to a set of philanthropic and charity organisations. \"Fashion is an effective means for public adoption of a new product or technology. Everyone wants to look sexy and if you're creating a secondary benefit, such as producing your own energy, it's a win win.\" The sustainable fashion hub is funded by H&amp;M.

This comes at a time when Arctic summer sea ice melted to its sixth-lowest extent this year: 1.9m square miles. 2012 still holds the record, with just 1.32m square miles of sea ice by the summer’s end. At roughly the same time, Antarctic winter sea ice hit a record high of 7.76m square miles. This seeming contradiction in polar ice conditions has armed the arguments of global warming deniers: while the climate might be changing, the results at a global scale seem to be “evening out”, right? If the total amount of ice on the planet’s surface remains the same, does it really matter where it is? The short answer is yes. More sea ice around Antarctica does not make up for less in the Arctic Ocean. Here’s what you need to know: What is sea ice? Sea ice is frozen seawater that forms and floats on the surface of a polar ocean. It increases during that pole’s autumn and winter, while breaking up and melting during the spring and summer. How is sea ice different from glaciers? Glaciers are masses of freshwater ice that cover land. They grow when precipitation hits the surface of the ice and freezes, while at lower depths a glacier can be melting year-round due to geothermal heat. The enormous glaciers covering Greenland and the Antarctic continent are so big that they’re termed “ice sheets.” How is Arctic sea ice different from Antarctic sea ice? The Arctic consists of an ocean surrounded relatively closely by land, while Antarctica is the inverse: a polar continent ringed by a massive sea, the Southern Ocean. Around Antarctica, however, sea ice conditions have historically been more changeable because there is no land blocking the ice from spreading out across the Southern Ocean and encountering warmer winds and waters around its edges. “It’s like the difference between a room and a wall,” says Ted Scambos, a lead scientist with the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. “In the Antarctic there’s one wall, but in the Arctic there’s four walls” surrounding the Arctic Ocean. Before human-propelled climate change began to warm the Arctic, the summer and winter extents of Arctic sea ice were fairly consistent from year to year, and a good deal of Arctic sea ice would endure over multiple years to form a resilient, year-round layer of ice over the ocean, helping to keep temperatures cool. That has changed in the past decade. While more than half the Arctic ice pack used to be multi-year ice, says Julienne Stroeve, a research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, “after 2007 and 2012, big ice loss years, about 70% of the ice pack was first-year, and the rest multi-year. “In 2013, less than 5% of Arctic sea ice was five years or older,” Stroeve says. “In 1980s-90s, 20% or more was five years or older.” What’s causing the unusual decrease in Arctic sea ice? Climate change is increasing temperatures in the world’s far north at a faster rate than in lower latitudes (an effect sometimes called “Arctic amplification”). Over the past half-century, average temperatures in the contiguous 48 US states have increased by an average of 1.7F (1C) above historic norms, while those across Alaska have gone up an average of 3.4F(2C) year-round, and 6.3F(4C) in winter. As warming conditions over the past few decades have intensified summer melting of the Arctic ice cap, more of the ocean’s surface has been exposed to the sun’s rays. When solar rays hit sea ice, the light-colored ice reflects much of it back into space; this effect is called “albedo.” Open, dark Arctic Ocean water absorbs a lot more solar energy than it reflects, however, warming the sea water. This makes it harder for new ice to form in the fall and winter, and for multi-year ice to last through the summer. What happens when there is less Arctic sea ice? For the estimated 4 million people living and working above the Arctic Circle, the effects of less sea ice have been profound and life-altering. The decrease and thinning of protective sea ice has exposed coastal towns to enormously destructive waves and winds. The resulting coastal erosion is so severe that nearly 200 native villages have little choice but to move – sometimes from lands that their communities have lived upon for hundreds of years. Shipping and tourism in the Arctic are increasing as disappearing sea ice allows a reliably clear route across the northernmost waters to open earlier in the spring and close later in the fall. Many people are looking eagerly to increased economic opportunities in the Arctic, since a polar shipping route cuts travel time between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by 40%. Polar bears, narwhals and Pacific walruses are just some of the Arctic wildlife evolved to depend upon sea ice as a platform for resting or hunting, or protecting themselves and their offspring from predators. With temperatures warming and ice in decline, some are facing existential challenges in the wild. But more southerly species may be able to take advantage of less ice cover to expand their ranges – orcas are already doing so. Does less Arctic sea ice affect the weather? “It’s not an easy thing to unravel, but there is a lot of evidence coming into play that amplified warming in the Arctic is having an impact on weather patterns in lower latitudes,” says Stroeve. There is a lot of research going on to better answer this question, according to Tom Peterson of the US National Climatic Data Center, who told reporters on a November press call about the climate that “we’ve had a lot of studies going on about the potential influence of lack of Arctic sea ice on events around the world”, but must “wait for the peer-reviewed science to be done before we can say anything” conclusive. With average global temperatures on the rise, why is there so much Antarctic sea ice in winter? “In general, because of the geography, with the Antarctic continent as the center of a very broad expanse of ocean and the southern end of all the globe’s other major oceans, there’s a natural high degree of variability to Antarctic sea ice,” Scambos says, with huge year-to-year changes in the extent of Antarctic sea ice more common than in the Arctic. Scientists are still exploring all the factors that affect Antarctic sea ice, however – including whether hotter temperatures are actually contributing to the recent record-setting amount of winter ice. It’s well established that as climate change increases subsurface ocean temperatures, Scambos says, the glaciers flowing off the edge of Antarctica into the Southern Ocean are melting at an increasing rate. This melt adds billions of tons of fresh water to the surrounding seawater. Since “in the ocean density controls motion”, Scambos says, and fresh water is less dense than seawater, the slightly freshened seawater at the foot of the glaciers rises to the surface of the coastal waters – and then sits there. “So now we have a bigger and more stable ‘puddle’ of water at the surface of the ocean that’s slightly fresher than it used to be, and less dense”, Scambos says, than the waters surrounding it, “and more conducive to forming sea ice.” Does this mean that climate change isn’t affecting the south pole? Sorry, it does not. This swing in southern sea ice, whether natural or caused by global warming, is happening in parallel with clear signals of climate change in the region. Antarctica “is showing a warming air temperature trend on the continent by just about every recent analysis there is”, Scambos says, and “ocean-driven melting around Antarctic is on the increase.” Winds in Antarctica have changed as well, he says, in ways that are consistent with what scientists expect to see, thanks to both the global increase in greenhouse-gas pollution and the regional loss of ozone in the atmosphere. Will having more sea ice in the Antarctic make up for having less in the Arctic? No. Increased ice around Antarctica will not help a resident of the Arctic Circle whose coastal land is eroding, or an Arctic animal species that depends upon ice for feeding, resting or protection. There is also no trade-off on a global scale. “In the Antarctic, we’re adding ice to the fringe of a polar cap that was already ice-covered during this period of time,” Scambos says. This slight increase to south polar albedo does not balance out the decreased albedo in the Arctic caused by that region’s loss of snow and ice cover.

Research by the Frankfurt school, Bloomberg and the UN environment program found in 2013 that Australia made $US4.4bn in new investment in renewable energy, such as solar, wind and geothermal, a 0.1% decrease on the previous year. This places Australia ninth in the world, ahead of Italy, but behind the likes of South Africa, Canada, India and Germany. China, which invested $US54.2bn last year, topped the list, followed by the US on $US33.9bn. Renewables, excluding large hydro projects, accounted for nearly 44% of the world’s newly installed energy generation in 2013, saving the planet 1.2 gigatonnes of carbon emissions. Total investment fell 14% to $US214.4bn, which the report partially attributes to the falling cost of solar energy systems. Australia’s renewables take-up has been led by domestic solar use, with more than 1m rooftop solar systems installed. The federal government is undertaking a review of the renewable energy target (RET), which mandates that 20% of Australia’s electricity must be sourced from renewables by 2020. The review is headed by a former Reserve Bank board member, Dick Warburton, who has previously said he is sceptical of the science of climate change. Senior Coalition figures are understood to be keen to scrap or drastically wind back the RET, saying it drives up energy costs. The Australian Energy Market Commission found the RET was responsible for about 4% of the average household power bill in 2013-14, dropping to a likely 3.1% in 2014-15. Kane Thornton, the deputy chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said uncertainty over the future of the RET was hindering investment in renewables. “The RET review is causing a lot of uncertainty, there is definitely a slowing down in the industry,” he told Guardian Australia. “If we removed the RET, it would increase our exposure to gas, and gas prices are going up. This will lead to higher energy prices, impacting jobs and investment. It’s easy to ask for the RET to be shut down but people don’t realise the impact of that. “Over 100 countries have a target to expand renewables, so if we reduce our target, we’d slip very quickly out of the top 10. “There is some possibility of that happening with the RET review. But I’m confident that when people look at the evidence, they’ll see that there are a lot of benefits for a small cost.” Thornton said Australia was already being left behind by countries such as Germany and Japan, even though these countries don’t have the same exposure to sunlight or wind. “In my mind, we could certainly do a lot more,” he said. “Countries around the world are pushing harder than us, even though we have world-leading resources when it comes to sun and wind. “There are regular delegations from Europe and Japan, who are already ahead of us in the top 10, and they say they could do even more, at less cost, if they had the same resources as Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/31/beavers-back-welcome-them-open-arms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-31T08:30:05Z","webTitle":"Beavers are back – and we should welcome them with open arms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/31/beavers-back-welcome-them-open-arms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/31/beavers-back-welcome-them-open-arms","fields":{"headline":"Beavers are back – and we should welcome them with open arms","bodyText":"It’s a warm summer evening. The sun is low, firing the tops of the birches around the loch to burning gold. There’s no wind, and gnats dance in three-dimensional mobiles in front of the hide we’re sitting in at the edge of the water. It’s a Monet scene. Brown trout nose lazily through a maze of lily leaves lying like large dinner plates on the surface of the water. Every few seconds they snatch at a fly; a pointillist flank curves and vanishes. “There!” A ranger is pointing. Suddenly, everyone is peering intently through binoculars. “Where? I can’t see it.” A woman sounds desperate. “Look for the bow-wave. The long line – there! – under the overhanging branches, heading this way. Got it now?” We’ve been showing people wild beavers for nine years now. Wild, yes, but captive. Our beavers are in a large, fenced wetland enclosure, a whole eight-acre loch and its associated marshes and deciduous woodland in Inverness-shire – perfect beaver habitat. They don’t know they’re captive, and they don’t need to, since they have everything they want: plenty of food; birch and willow trees to fell for bark – they are strictly herbivorous – and to build their lodges and dams; streams and ditches to dam; canals to dig; lagoons to create. That’s what beavers do: beavering away, they adjust their habitat to suit themselves, and just about everything else as well. This week, Natural England took the sensible decision to let the free- living beavers on the River Otter at Ottery St Mary in Devon stay where they are, to breed and disperse naturally, while being monitored for the next five years – effectively a beaver trial similar to what has happened in Scotland, officially at Knapdale in Argyllshire and unofficially on the River Tay in Perthshire. Our setup is different. It’s a demonstration project, designed to show people what beavers are and what they do. Our rangers monitor the habitat through every season with photographs from set positions, and by that delightful every-child-should-do-it business of pond-dipping – messing about with nets and buckets, in and out of boats, shrieks of glee and endless wet feet. We systematically analyse the catches, count the bugs and beasties: dragonfly and caddis larvae; great diving beetles, tiny fish, water boatmen, worms, flukes and leeches; tadpoles, water spiders and snails; even right down to some semi-microscopic stuff like midge larvae, water fleas, hydra and rotifers. We do the plants, too – some in the water, some out – and the fungi, and the lichens and ferns, and great green hassocks of wetland mosses. Then there’s the wild flowers, such as northern marsh orchids and the insectivorous butterwort – the lovely, lethal, sky-blue flower on a single stem that lurks in acid bogs and tricks flying insects into landing on its sticky leaves. And every spring we do a bird count. Beavers lower the canopy around a water body by felling trees and digging canals – opening it up. Solar energy piles in to places that have been in shade for decades. They stir life into action, kicking up nutrients as they beaver about their daily doings. Nature loves change; it frees up opportunities. Species of every size and shape wade in and snatch their chances. Beavers shift everything, tirelessly, instinctively, creatively. That’s why ecologists call them a “keystone species”. By doing their own thing, they create habitats and opportunities for just about everything else. Our nine years of soggy monitoring have demonstrated precisely what the scientific literature predicts. Measured against adjacent wetland the beavers have not utilised, we find that biodiversity has expanded by a factor of four. That’s a 300% increase on the initial pre-beaver presence: more aquatic bugs for fish to hoover up; more fish for herons, diving ducks, grebes, otters and ospreys; more newts, frogs and toads; more insects for small birds to snatch; more small mammals, including water voles and water shrews, for owls and other predators. And so it continues up the chain: more food for pine martens, stoats, weasels, foxes, badgers; more and a wider variety of wild flowers and wetland plants. Altogether more of just about everything, in a happier, fatter, richer, healthier and more diverse ecosystem bubbling with life and energy. That, you might think, would be justification enough to reintroduce the beaver, but it’s only half the story. The incidental benefits beavers deliver for free include flood retention, thanks to their small dams; preventing flash-flood siltation, which is a real hazard to young fish; and creating fish nurseries in their lagoons and ponds behind the dams. When the BBC’s Autumnwatch came to our loch a few years ago, their sneaky night-vision cameras caught an otter in one beaver lagoon hunting for fish and frogs. Round and round it went, up and down, as lithe as an eel, every few seconds surfacing with a munchy, crunchy mouthful. Cameras don’t lie. That lagoon, entirely created by beavers, contained an otter smorgasbord. And then there is the animal itself. Our project has shown wild beavers to 5,000 people on week-long wildlife programmes over nine years. If you include food and accommodation, petrol, postcards and all the other usual tourist spin-offs at around a grand a week, that’s an ecotourism benefit to the local rural economy of £5m. All wetland and riverine ecosystems in Britain should include beavers. That sounds a sweeping statement, until you examine it a bit more closely. First of all, they did – for thousands of years. After the ice cap retreated from northern Europe 12,000 years ago, the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) was a permanent member of our mammalian fauna, present in just about every wetland habitat that suited it. Then we put a price on its head and hunted it for its seductively soft fur (excellent for making felt), its castoreum (glandular oil used for medicinal purposes) and its meat. By the reign of Henry VIII, beavers were extinct in England and reduced to a few remote locations in the Highlands of Scotland. We think the last wild beavers were trapped near Loch Ness in the late 17th century. Now they are back. There could easily be 300 wild beavers in Britain today. Most of them are on the Tay and its eight tributaries, stretching more than 100 miles from Loch Rannoch in the west to Forfar on the Firth. They arose from an initial escape of two females and a male from a wildlife park in 2001, later supplemented by accidental escapees from one or two private collections. The River Tay is ideal beaver habitat, particularly the upper, less agricultural reaches of its tributaries. It is also prime salmon- and trout-fishing territory. Despite reams of scientific evidence from the 24 European countries that have successfully reintroduced beavers, and the fact that beavers have been quietly cohabiting with many species of fish for millennia, some anglers – and now fishermen in Devon – worry that beaver dams will prevent access by migratory fish, especially salmonids, to some tributary streams. We await a decision on both the Knapdale and the Tay populations from Scottish ministers: to cull or to chill – or, most likely, to fudge the issue and hope to be moved to another department as quickly as possible. The Tay beavers have already had one stay of execution, when Scottish Natural Heritage dreamed up a spectacularly dotty policy to trap them all, then discovered – oops! – that perhaps there were a few more than they had bargained for, met a barrage of fury from the public and the press and retreated with muddy faces and tails between legs. The only animal they caught promptly died, and the public indignation quotient shot off the scale. It will be a brave minister who risks another fiasco. Years ago, I knew the River Otter very well. I have fished it and canoed its dreamy Devon reaches. It is right for beavers. They are mammals of optimum habitat. That means they will cruise upstream and downstream until they find the place they like best. Then they will stay, dig burrows in banks and build impressive lodges of mud, sticks and logs dragged and packed into a dome, with underwater entrances to protect their young from predators (they are hard-wired to think there is a wolf, a lynx, a bear or a wolverine behind every bush). Here they will breed, producing two to three kits every year. When they have eaten all the food easily reached from the safety of water in that location, they will move on. They will disperse, often for miles, until they find the next most appealing place. They may not return to the former site for decades. A beaver very rarely ventures more than 50m from a watercourse, so the only trees likely to be affected are those on riverbanks and around lakes. If you don’t want the cherry trees on your water frontage felled, all you have to do is wrap a 3ft length of wire netting around the trunk – beavers won’t touch it. If they do cause a problem, they are not difficult to remove. In Norway, I have asked farmers what they think about the beavers on their land. They are both very accepting and very practical. “Oh, the beaver,” they say, “he is there, and this is his home.” And if he is a nuisance? “Oh, then we shoot him and eat him and make a hat for the wife from his fur.” But Britain has signed up to European protection for wildlife, which could block unlicensed hunting. Whatever English or Scottish ministers would like to do, they will have to dream up damage mitigation measures that are legal, publicly palatable and acknowledge the beaver as a native species. Suddenly, someone shouts. “Look!” Another beaver has popped up among the lilies, right in front of us. Only its head is visible, and its prehensile hands that are delicately plucking lily blooms and stuffing them greedily into its mouth. “Oh my God,” someone mutters, “that’s bloody brilliant!” John Lister-Kaye is director of Aigas Field Centre (aigas.co.uk).

The country’s target of getting 80% of energy from renewable sources by 2050 is one of the few to match the scaling-up of renewable power that the UN’s climate science panel said on Sunday was needed to avoid “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” from global warming.The Energiewende (‘Energy transition’) programme to chisel fossil fuels out of Germany’s energy mix has a breathtakingly ambitious air that has swept through the north city-state of Bremen, where even the football stadiums and funfairs run entirely on clean energy. In 2008, shortly after the EU set its green energy targets for 2020, the Freimarkt funfair and Werder Bremen football club both switched to renewable power, with the club completely renovating its stadium in a business deal with energy company EWE. “Our colours are green and white,” said Klaus Filbry, the managing director of Werder Bremen, which is home to Europe’s first and largest solar-powered football stadium. “The green stands for being environmentally conscious and the white stands for peace. It is important for us. We get a lot of support from the community and we want to give back to them. All the electricity we produce goes into the grid system.” Fans can sign up to buy 1% of their electricity from the stadium, which with a solar capacity of 1.2MW produces enough surplus energy to power 400-500 houses a year. The better the team perform, the lower the electricity tariff, although this is not a selling point for Bremen fans this year. The Weser Stadium is armadillo-plated with 200,000 single module solar cells that resemble a huge postmodern lampshade. Next to it is a solar-powered restaurant. Not all the Werder Bremen players were initially excited by the green makeover. But Clemens Fritz, the team captain, told the Guardian: “When I heard that the stadium would be transformed into a ‘futuristic spacecraft’ I was delighted that it would not only look fantastic but also generate environmentally friendly energy.” “The whole facade and roof were built for €11.5m,” according to EWE spokesman and Bremen fan, Christian Bartsche. “Economically, it just breaks even but in marketing terms it has such a positive image that it is a plus for us. The Weser Stadium is like a lighthouse that anyone can see as they fly into Bremen. It lights up the region.” Bremen is not alone. The nearby state of Schleswig-Holstein is close to producing all of its electricity from wind power, and Germany as a whole is aiming for 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Filbry said he could imagine a club attaching wind turbines to its floodlights. “Like us, it would have a unique visibility and it could work – especially in an area where there’s a lot of wind,” he said But in the solar industry, falling solar panel costs spurred by Chinese mass production have sucked almost half of the jobs out of a sector that employed 100,000 people in 2012. At the same time, cheaper solar has reduced retail prices, spurring consumer uptake but bringing cuts to public support schemes. Filbry said that the removal of tax incentives for solar had already affected all clubs with tie-ins to renewable energy firms: “A lot of those partnerships were finished because of changes to the law and that certainly had a financial effect that was felt in the league. Less money came in. Our sponsorship with one company went down from €500,000 to €200,000. We were able to compensate and find other partners but it did hurt the club financially.” Filbry admits that the club had less money to spend on players for a time but stoutly denies any link to the club’s current position at the bottom of the Bundesliga. Subsidy cutbacks have been felt across the industry, as the cost of solar power has fallen closer to the cost of fossil fuel energy. From a zenith of $0.90 per kilowatt hour, German feed-in-tariffs that pay people for generating energy from solar have fallen to around $0.20 per kwh today. The guaranteed 20-year tariff offered to early household investors is now a thing of the past. An EU state aid decision this year that solar had reached industrial ‘maturity’ will accelerate the subsidy tail-off in 2015. Anger is widespread in Germany that the EU commissioner responsible for the decision, Joaquín Almunia, allowed nuclear energy in the UK another 30 years of public backing. “It is completely irrational,” said Milan Nitzschke, the vice president of SolarWorld, one of the world’s largest solar panel manufacturers. The Bonn-based firm failed in a recent attempt to launch an EU anti-dumping case against Chinese manufacturers. “We don’t have subsidy free markets anywhere in the EU so why is the commission ruling against feed-in-tariffs for renewables in Germany while granting them in the UK for nuclear?” Nitzschke said. “The thinking is completely wrong. It is creating a less efficient system that only benefits major players with huge windfall effects.” The EU’s recent decision to mandate a 27% share for renewables across Europe by 2030 was “only symbolic, nothing more,” he added, as the commission would have no enforcement powers over member states. “But we know there is a need for renewables in every European energy market and solar is the upcoming cheapest energy source. We’re now at a level where we can compete with gas-fired plants when the sun shines, so solar will anyhow become one of the major electricity sources.” Frauke Thies, the energy policy director for the European Photovoltaic Industry Association told the Guardian, said: “Downsizing the EU’s political ambition for renewables now means stopping right before the finish-line. By slowing down the pace of renewables uptake, Europe risks being left behind in the global energy transition.” Last year, renewables provided around 24% of Germany’s electricity, but coal and lignite accounted for 45% - 2% up from 2011, when the country began switching off nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The phase-out is expected to complete in 2022, adding to a sense of urgency in the energiewende transition strategy. New innovations, such as an expensive Eqoo solar storage unit that EWE put on the market in April, are to provide somewhere to bank unused solar power. The Eqoo stores solar energy for around six hours but so far just 80 units have been sold. “You have to inform the public about it and convince them it’s a good idea,” Bartsche said. “You also have to find the first-time buyers, as customers who already have solar panels on their homes are getting enough money for their kilowatt hours.” With home-generated solar electricity around half the price charged by power companies, it makes more sense to use your own sunshine. At the Next Energy research lab in Oldenburg, thin-film solar panels are in development in a variety of colours. The flimsy panels are one micrometre thick – compared to 200-300 micrometres for traditional PV panels – and can be used for windowpanes and house tiles. Dr Thibo Kilper, Next Energy’s research manager says that commercial negotiations are underway and the product could be appearing in new house builds by 2016. But similar problems are holding the next-generation solar sector back. “A lot of partners for publicly-funded projects went bankrupt and disappeared from the market,” Kilper said. “It meant that many months and years of work were for nothing. It is a little frustrating but we have to be creative. We are looking at other European markets.” The EU’s relatively low 2030 target was “frustrating,” he said, as a dynamic market and clear public interest were not being allowed to grow as fast as possible. “There are strong lobbies from conventional fossil fuels working against us. This is clear,” agreed Dr Wedigo von Wedel, Next Energy’s head of energy storage division. “There needs to be some money and force behind our research to make the energiewende a reality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jun/04/plan-fracking-firms-drill-homes-queens-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-04T14:38:18Z","webTitle":"Government confirms plan to let fracking firms drill under homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/04/plan-fracking-firms-drill-homes-queens-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jun/04/plan-fracking-firms-drill-homes-queens-speech","fields":{"headline":"Government confirms plan to let fracking firms drill under homes","bodyText":"The government confirmed its intention to change trespass laws and allow fracking companies to drill under people's homes without their permission in the Queen's speech on Wednesday, but the measure was not included in the infrastructure bill as expected. Instead, ministers will wait for the result of a 12-week consultation before moving to add the measure to legislation. The proposal is highly controversial, being opposed by three-quarters of the public, and Greenpeace turned David Cameron's Oxfordshire home into a \"fracking site\" on Wednesday morning. But ministers and the shale gas and oil industry see the move as essential to speeding up the exploitation of the resource. Green legislation laid out for the last parliament before the 2015 general election included a right for local communities to buy into renewable energy projects, a 5p tax on plastic bags in England and a new, but watered-down, pledge to make all new homes zero-carbon by 2016. New laws to enable the rapid eradication of invasive alien species will be introduced but an expected ban on the use of wild animals in circuses was missing. The Queen referred to the change in trespass law by stating: \"The [infrastructure] bill will enhance the UK's energy independence and security by opening up access to shale and geothermal sites.\" But official briefing notes accompanying the speech said: \"Subject to consultation, this bill would support the development of gas and oil from shale and geothermal energy by clarifying and streamlining the underground access regime. The government is currently running a full consultation on this policy and the legislation is entirely dependent on the outcome of that consultation.\" Government sources from both coalition parties insisted there was no rowing back on their intention to accelerate fracking. Earlier in 2014, ministers abolished the need to inform residents individually of planned fracking activity in their area despite the public expressing overwhelming opposition in a consultation. \"The [trespass and fracking] consultation contains only one proposal, the same as that put forward by the Queen today, which raises the question of whether the consultation is genuine or if, in fact, the outcome is a foregone conclusion,\" said the legal expert Angus Evers, at King &amp; Wood Mallesons SJ Berwin. \"I was surprised when the consultation came out a few weeks ago. But when you are talking about taking away people's property rights it is entirely right that there should be a public consultation. However, I think the proposal will go ahead in some shape or form.\" John Sauven, the Greenpeace UK executive director, said announcing the trespass measure in the Queen's speech just days after launching the consultation made \"a mockery of public participation\". He said: \"Ministers are losing the argument on fracking and are now steamrolling over people's rights in order to sacrifice our countryside and climate.\" Greenpeace activists in hard hats and high-vis jackets turned up on the doorstep of the prime minister's cottage in the Cotswold hamlet of Dean, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday and sealed off the property's front gate with security fencing. They erected a sign that read: \"We apologise for any inconvenience we may cause while we frack under your home,\" and directed complaints to the PM's office. Ken Cronin, chief executive of the UK Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG), which represents the onshore oil and gas industry, welcomed the Queen's speech. \"The proposed legislation will bring the onshore oil and gas and geothermal industries into line with other activities, such as mining and utilities, and will have no noticeable effect on the lives of home and property owners,\" he said. \"It serves no one if an anomaly in the legal system allows the few to block access to much needed natural resources.\" He said UKOOG would respond to the consultation but did not think the government's attitude to fracking had altered. Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, welcomed giving communities the right to take a financial stake in local wind and solar energy projects: \"This is an important step for securing sustained public support for renewables.\" But she criticised exemptions to the zero-carbon home standard, saying these benefited developers over the homebuyers who would face higher energy bills as a result. The proposal to tackle the growing problem of invasive alien species follows recommendations from the Law Commission in February. It found: \"They pose a significant threat to ecosystems as well as damaging property and infrastructure [but] existing law does not contain sufficient powers to allow for their timely and effective control or eradication.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/03/earth-has-fever-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-03T12:30:00Z","webTitle":"Earth has a fever, but the heat is sloshing into the oceans | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/03/earth-has-fever-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/03/earth-has-fever-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Earth has a fever, but the heat is sloshing into the oceans","bodyText":"Much has been made about the Earth's energy imbalance (extra energy absorbed by the Earth). It is clear the Earth is out of balance, in laypersons' terms, it has a \"fever\". What isn't clear is how bad the fever is. A new study by Dr. Matt Palmer and Dr. Doug McNeall moves us closer to answering this \"fever\" question. These scientists used data from the latest group of climate computer models (CMIP5) to look at the relationships between the energy flows at the top of the atmosphere, the surface temperature of the Earth, and changes in ocean energy. They made (in my mind), three important conclusions. First, there is a lot of variability in the Earth surface temperature. In fact, these natural fluctuations of the Earth surface temperature (0.3 degrees C per decade) can mask much of the underlying global warming. Consequently, you cannot use Earth surface temperatures over 10 years or so as an indicator of the Earth \"fever\". As we look over longer periods of time, the \"masking\" of global warming by internal fluctuations gets smaller; however, even for 15 years or so, natural fluctuations and human-caused global warming can be about the same size. Second, the authors found that an increase in the ocean energy explains almost all (95%) of the variation in the Earth energy balance. This means that more complete measurements of the global oceans would enable us to better measure the \"fever.\" Finally, for time periods longer than a year, the ocean becomes the dominant storage reservoir for heat. There were some other conclusions that are noteworthy. For instance, we have heard a lot about how things like volcanoes, human particulate emissions, and solar variability can also impact our understanding of the Earth's \"fever.\" The current paper argues that these \"external\" influences may be smaller than the natural variability of the Earth system itself – the \"sloshing\" of energy in/out, and within the Earth system. Another phenomenon that has been reported on quite a bit recently, including by me and my colleague in these pages, is the role of energy storage deep in the ocean. The authors confirm that such storage likely plays a contributing factor to the internal variability. According to one of the authors, Dr. Palmer, who spoke about the importance of ocean and satellite measurements of the Earth's \"fever,\" \"My view is the net radiation at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy flow is the most fundamental measure of global warming since it directly represents the accumulation of excess solar energy in the Earth system. The lack of correlation between global surface temperature and TOA over ten years or so tells us that temperature trends are not a good indicator of how much energy is accumulating in the Earth system over the same period. This means that the recently observed \"pause\" in surface warming may tell us nothing about longer-term global climate change. Doug McNeall added, \"If you want to measure global warming on timescales of about a decade, measure the temperature of the oceans. The deeper you measure, the more accurately you'll measure the warming.\" As I've said before, there is no \"pause\" in global warming. The Earth continues to absorb enormous amounts of energy. My own research and my colleague's have shown this, so too does updated and available data from NOAA. This paper is just the umpteenth nail in the coffin of that myth. It is also a note of caution from this paper: don't confuse the \"slosh\" with the \"fever\", or you might end up with egg on your face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/01/restricting-onshore-windfarms-costly-policy-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-01T16:44:34Z","webTitle":"Restricting onshore windfarms would be a costly policy decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/01/restricting-onshore-windfarms-costly-policy-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/01/restricting-onshore-windfarms-costly-policy-decision","fields":{"headline":"Restricting onshore windfarms would be a costly policy decision","bodyText":"Onshore wind turbines are a significant and fast-growing source of electricity in the UK and are also the cheapest source available for the low-carbon energy needed to meet the country's legally binding carbon targets. David Cameron's reported desire to cap their numbers would mean building more offshore wind turbines or nuclear power stations, both of which are more expensive. In 2013, the 4,338 wind turbines dotted across the country generated almost 5% of Britain's electricity, an increase of a third on the previous year. Together, those turbines have a capacity of over 7GW, enough to power 3.8m homes. Windfarms have often encountered huge local opposition. Some analysts attribute this to the fact that about 90% are owned by large energy companies, rather than being owned by local communities – as in Germany. The government was rattled by a letter opposing onshore windfarms sent to the prime minister in 2012 by 100 Conservative MPs and has been careful not to set a specific target for future turbine numbers. Ministers have also cut the subsidies for onshore windfarms and changed planning rules to make it harder to get permission for new turbines. However, the most recent government \"scenario\" envisages significant growth in onshore windfarms to 11-13 GW. There are currently just over 3,000 new turbines in construction or with planning approval. If all were built, that reach a total of 13GW of generation capacity. An additional 3,350 turbines (8GW) are in the planning system, although many are likely to be refused permission. The head of the Committee on Climate Change - the government's official climate adviser, has said that objections against windfarms for blighting landscapes were legitimate but that suggestions wind power was too intermittent to be useful were \"rubbish\". Adair Turner said: \"If someone argues they passionately believe that windmills are bad for the aesthetic environment and are willing to do more nuclear instead, or willing to bear the cost of offshore wind, that is a real argument.\" Suggestions that turbines can cause ill health have been debunked and there is little evidence that erecting turbines damages property prices. In opinion polls, onshore wind power is consistently supported by a large majority of the UK public, even when asked about having turbines built near their homes and even among Conservative and Ukip voters. But the minority who are strongly opposed tripled to 21% between 2010 and 2012 in Guardian polling. After solar energy, wind power is routinely more popular than all other energy technologies, including shale gas and nuclear. A key objection raised by opponents is that the subsidies given to onshore windfarms make them too expensive. Billpayers each paid £9 in 2013, or 0.7% of the average dual-fuel bill, to support onshore wind. But polling also shows majority support for the subsidies. The price of electricity from onshore wind per kilowatt is higher than that from gas-fired power stations. But wind power is virtually zero-carbon and the UK is committed to cut its carbon emissions by 50% by 2025. Low-carbon nuclear power from the planned new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset will be more expensive than onshore wind, under current subsidy plans, as are offshore wind farms, making it more expensive to meet the UK's climate change targets. They also note that green energy currently receives far lower subsidies than the nuclear or oil and gas industries did in their early stages of development."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/aug/25/unpacking-unpaused-global-warming-climate-models-right","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-25T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Unpacking unpaused global warming – climate models got it right| Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/aug/25/unpacking-unpaused-global-warming-climate-models-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/aug/25/unpacking-unpaused-global-warming-climate-models-right","fields":{"headline":"Unpacking unpaused global warming – climate models got it right","bodyText":"Although the global climate has continued to build up heat at an incredibly rapid rate, there has been a keen focus among climate contrarians and in the media on the slowdown of the warming at the Earth’s surface. The slowdown is in fact a double cherry pick – it focuses only on the 2% of global warming that heats the atmosphere (over 90% heats the oceans), and it only considers the past 10–15 years. Nevertheless, because there was so much attention paid to the surface warming slowdown, the latest IPCC report addressed it specifically, saying, The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012). From 1998 through 2012, the Met Office estimated that global surface temperatures had warmed by about 0.06°C, whereas the average climate model projection put the value at closer to 0.3°C. This apparent discrepancy only represented a tiny fraction of overall global warming, and over a short enough period of time that the internal noise of the climate system could be having a significant influence, but it was nevertheless a challenge for climate scientists to explain the precise causes of the difference. However, research published since the release of the IPCC report has gone a long way to explain the discrepancy, and it turns out the climate models are doing a pretty good job after all. Measurement Biases Exaggerated the Discrepancy One important paper published late last year by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way found that the discrepancy wasn’t nearly as large as believed. Climate scientists have known that the surface temperature record is incomplete because of gaps between instrument stations, especially in the Arctic. The Arctic happens to be the fastest-warming region on Earth, and so if it’s excluded from the surface temperature record, the record will have a cool bias. Cowtan &amp; Way took two separate clever approaches to address this issue, using statistics and satellite measurements to fill in the gaps. Both methods yielded similar results, showing that the Met Office estimates were accurate up to 1998, but underestimated the warming since 1998 by more than half, due in large part to the particularly rapid warming in the Arctic during that time. The Cowtan &amp; Way estimates put the global surface warming from 1998 through 2012 at about 0.17°C, explaining nearly half of the apparent difference between measurements and the average climate model projections. But the other half still needed to be explained. Cooling Influences from Oceans, Volcanoes, and the Sun A great many studies published over the past two years have shown that since 1998, more heat has been funneled into the deep oceans, leaving less to warm the atmosphere. Kevin Trenberth and colleagues produced one of the best data sets measuring ocean temperatures, finding an unprecedented warming of the deep oceans since 1998. A new paper shows that while oceans around the world are warming, most of the deep layer warming is happening in the Atlantic and Southern oceans. A recent study led by Matthew England showed that unprecedented trade wind strength has invigorated the circulation of the Pacific Ocean, causing more heat from the surface to be mixed down into deeper ocean layers, while bringing cooler waters to the surface. Papers by Kosaka &amp; Xie and James Risbey and colleagues showed that when climate models accurately reflect ocean cycles, their global surface temperature simulations are also accurate. At the same time, solar activity has declined and volcanic activity risen since 1998. Volcanoes pump aerosol particulates into the atmosphere that cause short-term cooling, and a decline in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface also has a cooling effect. Another recent paper led by NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt showed that when incorporating the observed changes in these two factors and the Cowtan &amp; Way corrections, climate models did a good job reproducing the observed global surface warming. With these internal (ocean cycle) and external (solar and volcanic activity) explanations, we were still left with the question – how much was each responsible for the global surface warming slowdown? Huber &amp; Knutti Show it’s about Half and Half A new paper published by Huber &amp; Knutti (good explanation here) has found that from 1998 to 2012, ocean cycles caused about 0.06°C global surface cooling, the sun caused 0.04°C, and volcanoes caused 0.035°C cooling. Putting it all together, we have 0.17°C observed surface warming according to Cowtan &amp; Way, and 0.13°C cooling from natural influences. If those natural factors hadn’t caused cooling since 1998, we would have seen 0.3°C global surface warming, right in line with climate model projections. The figure below from the Huber &amp; Knutti paper illustrates the point nicely. The dotted orange and solid black lines show the unadjusted average model projection and measured global surface temperatures, respectively. The solid orange and dashed black lines show these estimates adjusted to reflect the changes in ocean cycles, solar output, volcanic activity, and surface temperature measurement biases. Huber &amp; Knutti show that when climate models account for these short-term natural changes, their temperature projections are right on the money. The bad news is that we can’t yet predict changes in ocean cycles, solar output, or volcanic activity accurately, so it’s going to be hard to improve short-term climate model projections. The good news is that these factors make little difference in long-term climate changes or predictions. Solar and volcanic activity tend to be relatively stable, and will barely make a dent in human-caused global warming. Positive and negative phases of ocean cycles cancel each other out over the long-term. What about the Future? Long-term global warming is dictated by the Earth’s climate sensitivity. Huber &amp; Knutti showed that the average climate model output (with an average climate sensitivity of about 3°C global surface warming at equilibrium from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide) produces accurate global temperature predictions. They also tweaked the sensitivity of a climate model of intermediate complexity, and again showed when the aforementioned internal and external factors are accounted for, models with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3°C do the best job reproducing global surface temperature changes. When tweaked to have equilibrium climate sensitivities of 2°C and 4°C, the model surface temperature simulations were significantly less accurate. All of the available evidence indicates that the global surface warming slowdown is temporary, and will only last as long as solar activity keeps falling, volcanic emissions keep rising, and until ocean cycles switch phases. It’s only a matter of time until global surface warming once again accelerates. And until we get our carbon pollution under control, we’ll remain on a path towards highly dangerous and costly climate changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-20T07:09:51Z","webTitle":"Global Warning: 24 hours on the climate change frontline as Trump becomes president – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president","fields":{"headline":"Global Warning: 24 hours on the climate change frontline as Trump becomes president – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re just a few hours from Donald Trump being inaugurated as the president of the United States, and we’re signing off from our 24-hour Global Warning live blog: a marathon effort from our Guardian offices in London, New York and Sydney, as well as our correspondents dotted around the globe. What we’ve seen, as we’ve travelled around the world, is that regardless of what climate deniers (yes, deniers) like Trump may say about the science, the stark reality is that it is happening now. Both scientists and people at the front lines of climate change – in low-lying Pacific islands where freshwater supplies are being contaminated by salt; in poor farming Cambodian communities, where “life is a high-wire act with no safety net” – agree: there is no ambiguity. We are no longer fighting to stop climate change, but fighting to stop a runaway catastrophe. Governments must step up and take action. But in the meantime, we must all do what we can. We’ve heard people fighting climate change all around the world give their advice for what individuals can do, and most of them said similar things: become active on the issue, make your views known to politicians, and become a climate voter. Exactly what the Trump administration means for the world is not yet clear, but even if the Paris Agreement is weakened – even if the work is undone – not all hope is lost. There are signs that China might take a lead on climate change action, and investment in renewable energy around the globe seems unstoppable now. Thank you for joining us in our Global Warning project, and particularly those of you who have contributed to it in the comments or on social media. We’ve been struck by the thoughtfulness and nuance of your discussion; on the whole, it’s hard not to feel a little more optimistic. “For those standing on the precipice of life the impacts of climate change are an ever present reality,” writes Anika Molesworth, a young Australian working at at an agricultural research centre in Cambodia. She writes that the poorest farmers in Southeast Asia are those most vulnerable to climate extremes and seasonal vagaries. “For these farmers, many who live at subsistence level and survive on less that $1US a day, life is a high-wire act with no safety net. One stroke of bad luck – a drought, flood or pest outbreak – and they tumble further into hardship. … “Not a day goes by that I don’t stand in awe at an under-resourced team committed to moving mountains despite the odds lined up against them.” Much of the way we discuss climate-change mitigation focuses on supply: how to produce more energy, more cleanly. But some of the most fascinating conversations about climate-change in India are about reducing demand. India is a society undergoing enormous changes. Between now and 2040, the population of its cities will swell by an estimated 315m people – roughly the current population of the US. Over the next years, the estimated 240m Indians who currently lack access to electricity will be connected to the grid. The half-billion Indians who still rely on fuel wood for cooking will transition to using stoves. And by some rough projections, around 70% of the buildings that will exist in India in 2030 are yet to be built. Experts such as Navroz Dubash aren’t just thinking about how to power these changes, but how to lock in systems – of moving, cooking, cooling and lighting – that use a fraction of the energy it takes to power the same tasks in the west. One example he gives is appliances. The Indian government has started paying rebates to manufacturers who can produce more energy efficient 40-watt fans to reduce the drain during the nation’s sweltering summers. A bigger example – hundreds of thousands of high rises will spring up across Indian cities in the next 15 years. Energy researcher Radhika Khosla points out: building them to capture natural sunlight will reduce dependence on electric light. These opportunities exist across every sector. Investing in rail freight networks would use less energy, long-term, than trucking freight by road. Convincing Indians to cook using gas, instead of electricity, would also substantially cut energy use. Transport emissions too could be slashed if the hundreds of millions of Indians who flood into cities in the next decades could work within a short distance of their homes. “There’s a way to lock in institutional changes, technological changes and behavioural changes that are very difficult to undo,” Khosla says. “And that opportunity exists for countries like India, that are on the verge of great transitions.” Now we move to Mongolia, which is experiencing a disaster called a dzud, an extreme weather phenomenon commonly comprising heavy snow falls and temperatures below -40C. The dzud starves livestock as they are unable to graze, which in turn can devastate Mongolians, a third of whom are entirely dependent on livestock. The country used to suffer dzuds every decade or so but recently they have been occurring with growing frequency. This one is the second in a row. The full extent of the dzud will not be known until the end of spring but last year’s killed more than 1.1 million livestock and left hundreds of thousands of Mongolian herders living on the brink. Months of consistently heavy snow coverage and arctic temperatures have sparked fears of another devastating humanitarian crisis. The government has called for donations of warm clothing, food, medication for livestock, coal, hay, animal feed, insulation materials and other useful items for herders to help them survive the winter while preventing livestock deaths. Some areas of the country have already recorded temperatures as low as -50C and local media reports that more than 70% of Mongolia is covered with thick snow and ice. A dzud typically arrives after a summer drought or an early winter snow that melts then freezes over the land, cutting off food for livestock. Experts say the rising frequency is due to a combination of climate change and insufficient grasslands for large herds of livestock. Telmen Erdenebileg, Save the Children’s humanitarian program manager in Mongolia, is leading the organisation’s dzud response and has just returned from one of the worst affected provinces, Arkhangai. “The coming months are critical for herder families in the most heavily impacted areas. The end of winter is when stores of hay and fodder run out, and if there’s another large snowfall or temperatures remain so low we could see massive numbers of animals dying of starvation once again,” he told the Guardian from Ulaanbaator. “Just last week herders told me how they lost half or even three quarters of their herd last winter, and they are worried about what awaits them in the next few months. Livestock are everything out there: a source of food, nutritious milk, warm clothing with their skins and a commodity for trade or sale. Without animals, herders have no livelihood. Last year, Save the Children’s response to the dzud included distributing animal fodder and veterinary packages, fuel to help hospitals and schools, and cash grants for the most vulnerable families to buy essentials like warm clothing and nutritious food. Suppakorn Chinvanno, at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, has been creating maps that show dramatically how temperature changes will affect the Southeast Asia region, if high CO2 emission continues. Below is a map of Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, as well as parts of Myanmar and Malaysia. It shows the average daily maximum temperature from 1980 and projected to 2090. Chinvanno says the map suggests the region – already vulnerable to droughts and floods – is going to suffer more extreme and more frequent “abnormal weather patterns”. That’s to say, much longer dry periods with intense heat that could devastate agriculture, of which about a third of the population currently relies on. That said, rainfall could actually increase, he says, but it will come in shorter bursts with more intense downpours. His climate change model also suggests a possible half-metre rise in the sea level in some areas of Thailand, which will magnify flood risk along the coast. Over the past year, Thailand has been experiencing one of the worst droughts in decades and rice farmers are struggling. As we heard earlier, this was followed by terrible floods, one that killed 25 people this month and cut off large areas of the country. The below map shows the average daily minimum temperature during the same period, displaying how it will not only get much hotter but parts of the country will hardly cool down, a necessity for some crops to thrive. These scenarios are based on projections in which emission remain high. But even simulations that show lower CO2 levels have a similar result. Now Chinvanno is researching adaptations, in which Thailand moves to deal with the effects of climate change by changing farming strategies, boosting flood defences and water storage practices. “What we can do is to make ourselves more resilient,” he said. We’re reaching the end of our 24 hour blog, so it’s time to check the carbon countdown clock again. This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. By the time this blog finishes, the world will have emitted an estimated 112m tons (CO2-e) of greenhouse gases. Bangladesh is already one of the most climate vulnerable nations in the world, and global warming will bring more floods, stronger cyclones. Karen McVeigh, the Guardian’s global development reporter, filed this report from the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar where the fish-drying process is well underway. It can continue through to February or March if the weather is good. But Aman Ullah Shawdagor, a dry fish (known as shutki in Bangla) businessman who employs 70 people, said that rising tides and recent changes in the seasons has hit his business. “This is a dry season business. But for the last couple of years, the rain has become more frequent.” Scientists predict that, by 2050, as many as 25 million people in Bangladesh will be affected by sea level rise.

From 4pm to 5pm Sydney time, here’s what we explored: Solar power can drive a tuk-tuk from India to the UK: imagine the possibilities! Tim Flannery pens a sobering opinion piece about the threats posed by climate change to Australia’s unique wildlife The world’s climate-vulnerable megacity: is Mumbai ready for the big one?

Definitely flippers! Stop the press. First Dog On the Moon has filed a #GlobalWarning cartoon. Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin says: “This is a call to arms I mean flippers! A call to flippers!” If the grim statistics and worldwide perspective we’ve been reporting over the past 23 hours haven’t made an impact, perhaps this video with pop culture references put to jaunty music will. Here’s a video Australia’s Climate Council just released on Facebook: We’ve had a few posts about the effects of climate change on coral reefs. In particular, earlier in the day we had an interview with coral biologist Anne Hoggett, who lives and works on Lizard Island, in the remote northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. She spoke about the process coral goes through when it first bleaches, and then eventually dies. Here are a set of interactive before-and-after images we have, taken from Lizard Island, that show that very process. And if you want to read an in-depth feature about the 2016 global coral bleaching event, here’s one we published a few months ago: Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs. When Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister of Australia, it was hoped there’d be serious action on global warming – but the conservative government continues to fiddle on climate policy while the country burns, writes Guardian Australia’s editor-in-chief Lenore Taylor. Since you’re here … … We have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but far fewer are paying for it. And advertising revenues across the media are falling fast.

Tamil Nadu’s water crisis is a glimpse at the way climate change is already exacerbating environmental and political tensions in India. For future threats, go 1,300km northwest to Mumbai, India’s flashy financial capital – and the world’s climate-vulnerable megacity. To start with, much of the city was actually built on water: by rubble poured into the seas and swamps that separated seven islets in the Arabian sea. That process of reclamation continues today, and has severely distorted the terrain’s ability to deal even with unexceptional rainfall. A 2013 study found flooding would cost Mumbai around US$6.4b each year by 2050. It also means huge swathes of the city are low-lying. If sea levels rise at predicted rates, according to early research, around 40% of Mumbai could be submerged by the end of the century. A day of freak rainfall in July 2005 saw chest-high flooding in parts of the city and killed 500 people. But the real nightmare scenario is a category 4 or 5 storm blowing in from the Arabian sea. A new book by Amitav Ghosh, one of India’s best-known writers, imagines this very scenario. In the event of a two-to-three metre storm surge, Ghosh writes: “Waves would be pouring into south Mumbai from both its sea-facing shorelines; it is not inconceivable that the two fronts of the storm surge would meet and merge. In that case the hills and promontories of south Mumbai would once again become islands, rising out of a wildly agitated expanse of water.” Luckily, no storm like that has been seen in Mumbai in recent memory. But meteorologists are nearly unanimous in the view that increasing global temperatures will make tropical storms more severe. And a 2012 paper cited by Ghosh in his book predicts a 46% increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Arabian sea over the course of the century. Is Mumbai ready – either for “the big one”, or even just increased floods? I asked Atul Deulgoankar, an author and member of the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority. He said: “I’ve been part of the disaster management authority since its inception in 2006. In that time, not a single government, not a single chief minister or chief secretary has taken an interest in disaster-risk reduction. In 2005, we experienced heavy flooding because just one river was choked. And nothing has been done about that. There has been no campaign to clear water bodies or rivers. Nothing is happening systematically.” Tim Flannery, Australian palaeontologist, environmentalist and member of the Climate Council has penned a sobering opinion piece in the Guardian today, outlining the threat climate change is posing to Australia’s unique wildlife. And as he says, meanwhile, Australia is doing very little to improve their outlook: ...while other countries are winding down their coal use, Australia is attempting to ramp up our production and export of the product, all the while as we watch first-hand the immediate and long term damage coal and fossil fuels are wreaking on our planet, on people and on nature. You can read the full piece here: Naveen Rabelli, a 35-year-old engineer, wanted to show the power and potential of clean energy, so he designed and built a solar powered tuk-tuk and drove it 9,000 miles from India to the UK. “The moment I tell them it doesn’t require petrol, their minds are blown,” he said in September last year after he arrived in Dover following a seven month-long journey. His journey shows there is a sustainable alternative for the millions of tuk-tuks around the world. Read more about Rabelli’s journey here. Two more hours until we’ve gone round the world in 24 hours of climate change – thanks for following along, and particularly for the lively discussion below the line. We’d love to highlight and respond to more of your comments in the final stretch, so keep them coming. If you’re just joining us, in the past hour: We’ve heard how climate change is affecting already extreme climate in Australia’s Northern Territory Deforestation, and the role it plays in carbon emissions, has been explained in a neat infographic by The Wilderness Society Renowned climate scientist Michael E Mann shared his strategy on defeating climate deniers We’ve checked back in with the effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef – is the Australian government really doing all it can do to save its natural wonder? A short clip on the British Antarctic Survey’s activity at Rothera research station explains the answers to be found in Antarctica Oliver Holmes has reported back from southern Thailand, where unseasonably heavy rains have marked the start of what should be the dry season And is slowing the birth rate really the solution to climate change? It may be not so simple. A reader, witness67, has suggested that a “generational solution” to climate change is to “stop breeding”. But, as another commenter pointed out, that’s not necessarily the be-all and end-all. Global population is forecast to climb steadily, reaching 8.5bn in 2030, 9.7bn in 2050 and 11.2bn in 2100 – but the overall rate has been falling since the 1970s, and demographics are shifting. The number of births have peaked, or levelled off globally; the growth in population is due mostly to people living longer. We looked beyond the top line projections in a data blog last year. Here in Thailand, the south of the country has been experiencing unseasonably heavy rains, unusual for what should be the start of the dry season. More than 25 people have died and close to a million people, or 360,000 households, have been affected, with homes submerged in water. At one hospital, 100 patients had to be evacuated on small boats after the building was hit by overflowing reservoirs. A flash flood washed out a bridge on the country’s main north-south highway, backing up traffic for 200 km (125 miles). Footage on local television channels showed abandoned cars submerged in muddy water. The railway link was also cut off and the Department Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said that the main airport in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat would remain shut for the foreseeable future. Thailand’s rainy season usually ends in November. This year, intense rain has fallen well into what should be the dry season. There is debate among scientists on the reasons for the extreme weather we’re seeing in Thailand, with many pointing to the cyclical El Niño and La Niña patterns, in which oscillations in the temperatures between the atmosphere and the ocean create storms. It’s hard to isolate the impact of global warming, but increasing temperatures will lead to longer, more intense droughts and increasingly devastating flooding. Widespread floods in 2011 killed more than 900 people and caused major disruption to business, cutting economic growth that year in Thailand to just 0.1 %. We’ve heard quite a bit about Antarctica in the blog so far – both as a career-making site for scientists and a point of ongoing exploration. There’s good reason for that. What happens in Antarctica affects us all, as this video of British Antarctic Survey’s activity at the Rothera Research Station on the western Antarctic peninsula goes to show. In the future, this landscape could be almost barren; right now, it’s a living laboratory in which to study organisms being affected by climate change. For a live look at Rothera station, check out BAS’ webcam. A few commenters have argued that Australia isn’t doing enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef. It’s also worth remembering that climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and yet the government’s current policies leave it with no hope of meeting its emissions reduction targets. Here’s an interactive we recently made, showing the government’s own projected emissions, plotted against the reduction commitments we made as part of the Paris Agreement. Click “zoom out” to see how much we are set to miss our targets by. Renowned climate scientist Michael E Mann from the University of Pennsylvania will soon be visiting Australia as a guest of the Sydney Environment Institute and speaking at the University of Sydney in February. Ever since he and his colleagues did pioneering work, gathering temperatures from various records over the past 1000 years, and plotted them on a graph that became known as the “hockey stick graph”, Mann has been at the centre of a vicious fight between climate scientists and climate deniers. Ahead of his visit, I asked him over email about the role of climate deniers in Australian politics and what concerned citizens can do help stop climate change. Question: You’ve spent a long time battling with climate deniers. In Australia, we have a number of climate deniers both in the government and in the rest of the parliament. We also have a federal government that has no effective policies to curb carbon emissions. Do you think climate deniers are driving climate policy here in Australia. And if so, what is the best strategy to fight them? Michael Mann: Sadly, climate change deniers do indeed continue to have a voice in our public and policy discourse that is out of proportion with the merit of their views, thanks in large part to a megaphone that they have been granted by conservative media. The Murdoch media empire in particular – whose role is featured in our recent book ‘The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy” — has played a particularly vital role in the climate change disinformation campaign, and they dominate the news industry in Australia. Keep in mind that the second largest shareholder in NewsCorps, after Rupert Murdoch, is the Saudi Royal family, who obviously have a stake in our continued addiction to fossil fuels. As a consequence, they dominate the public discourse and provide cover for climate change-denying politicians. It is hardly surprising this has led to climate policy in Australia being driven by fossil fuel interests and their advocates. As for strategies to fight them, one of them is to speak out and to hold them accountable—which is something I do actively, whether it is speaking to the media, giving public lectures, writing commentaries and op-eds, and books. My ‘Madhouse Effect” lecture is really about how to move beyond climate change denial and get on to the legitimate debate about what to do about the threat of human-caused climate change. Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change? Michael Mann: We must hold our elected representatives responsible for representing our interests rather than the profits of polluting interests. Among other things, we must make sure to vote, and to be climate voters. A few people have mentioned the big role land-clearing plays in climate change. In Australia, it’s a big issue, with improvements made in previous years looking like they’re going to be undone, with new laws in Queensland and NSW making land clearing easier. The folks at The Wilderness Society have just put together this graphic, explaining the issue nicely. In Australia’s Northern Territory climate conditions are already extreme, with high heat, floods, monsoons, cyclones, and fires, and its economy relies heavily on industries affected by climate, including agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. But it doesn’t have much of a plan to deal with the effects of climate change, says David Morris, head of the Environmental Defenders Office. He tells the Guardian there have been some “positive noises” from the newly elected Labor government around renewable energy and increased funding and incentives, but notes that it’s one of the few jurisdictions without an adequate and current coastal management plan. “I doubt you could find many capital cities around the world that don’t have a coastal management strategy, that don’t have a climate change adaptation plan, and the Northern Territory is a place which is going to feel the effects of climate severely. “New roads, new pipelines, housing development, any kind of infrastructure you want to put in, any kind of decision you want to make under legislation where you’re spending public money, should now take into account climate change. “When you look at NT government information about climate change, it’s scant, there’s basically nothing. I mean, we’ve got sea level rise and that’s it.” Morris says current estimates are a sea level rise of 1.1m by 2100 would see between 250 and 400 residential buildings inundated by seawater, and would put 200km of NT roads, valued at just under AU $2 billion, at risk. Ecologically and economically significant tourism areas like Kakadu national park are also under threat, with increasing risks of saltwater intrusion threatening the fragile wetlands. We’re in the final stretch now. Here’s what we’ve covered in the last hour: The first-ever all-female expedition to Antarctica asks the question: is climate change a gender equality issue? Blair Palese, the chief executive of 350.org Australia, on how climate change deniers take their tactics “straight out of the tobacco playbook”; 350.org’s campaign against the Carmicheal coal mine; and what you can do to help combat climate change China correspondent Tom Phillips takes his air pollution-monitoring “egg” for a walk around Beijing – and runs into Boris Johnson The sperm bank that could hold the secret to saving the world’s coral reefs We’d love to hear more from you below the line, or on Twitter: I’m at @mlle_elle, Mikey is @MikeySlezak, and we’re using the hashtag #GlobalWarning. It’s also been some hours since you were last made aware of a penguin. And here’s the final part of our Q&amp;A with Blair Palese, chief executive of 350.org Australia. Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change? Blair Palese: I think it’s important that we all take responsibility for climate change as we’ve all been part of the system that created it. We have the power to decide who governs us and what issues made the priority agenda no matter what vested interests do or say to stymie action. And as consumers we have huge power to decide where our money goes. Anyone concerned about climate change needs to engage in politics, call your elected officials, email them, meet them at events and tell them you want urgent action or you’ll vote them out. Talk to people about it in your community, take steps together locally to make a difference. And think hard about what you are doing with your money. If you don’t like what your bank or superfund is investing in – say fossil fuel projects – tell them that and move to one that is fossil free. Finally, get involved with a group or issue you care about – help us stop the Adani coal mine, take on Chevron’s plans to drill in the Bight, switch your power company from the big three to a company investing in and campaigning for renewable energy. If you don’t have time, donate to keep the campaigning alive. Any one of these steps will make a real difference. Here’s another part of the Q&amp;A I did with 350.org Australia’s chief executive Blaire Palese. Here she discusses the recent suceses of the climate movement, and what we’re going to see this year. Question: Despite some big setbacks, the climate movement has claimed some victories too. It now looks like the whole movement in Australia is focussing on stopping Adani building the Carmichael Coal mine. What will that campaign look like? Blaire Palese The divestment of more than A$6 trillion (US$5.2 trillion) from fossil fuels is something I and the 350.org team are particularly proud of. The campaign started off very much as a symbolic effort. But much to our amazement after three years, it was all about money – and lots of it! – being moved from coal, oil and gas. Some 688 institutions and 58,399 individuals across 76 countries have committed to divest in some way. This is a real indicator that people are frustrated with government inaction and are taking their own steps to be part of the climate change solution. The Victorian gas ban could not have been achieved without a strong coalition of farmers, rural communities and city progressives that became a force that could not be ignored by the Andrews Government. Getting BP to drop plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight was a different story, with environmental groups using delaying tactics and the threat of a global public campaign to ensure the project was too costly and unviable. Right now, efforts to stop Adani from building the world’s largest new coal mine in Queensland is, for most of us concerned about climate change, the most critical fight in the country right now. Australia hasn’t opened up a new mineral reserve in 40 years, and if the Adani project goes ahead, the whole Galilee Basin could be developed, which would unleash enough coal to tip the carbon budget not just for us, but for the whole world. A broad coalition of environmental groups, local communities and Traditional Owners are coming together to do all we can to ensure this project doesn’t see the light of day. If you’d like to do something about climate change, join us to stop this climate-threatening coalmine! While the Queensland state government has said it’s doing all that it can to preserve the Great Barrier reef, a different kind of preservation work has been ongoing far from the reef – even the coastline – in regional New South Wales. Since 2011, scientists from Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Smithsonian Institution have been collecting and freezing coral sperm to store at Taronga’s CryoReserve in Dubbo. The project began in Australia in 2011, but has international partners that ensure the preservation of coral reefs worldwide. “It’s a bigger collaboration than just the Great Barrier Reef,” said coral scientist Bec Hobbs. By freezing the cells in liquid nitrogen to preserve them indefinitely, scientists can use similar technology as sperm-banking for human IVF to grow new coral and make entire reef systems more resilient to coming change. Researchers are also investigating the possibility of freezing coral eggs and larvae. There are more than 600 species of coral on the Great Barrier Reef – in the last spawning event in November, scientists were able to add four more to the bank, said Hobbs. “At the moment we have samples from about a meagre 11 species, but that is still the most species that are banked anywhere in the world.” But their efforts to collect more species have been frustrated by lack of knowledge about reefs and coral reproduction. “We know quite a bit about certain species and others, relatively nothing,” said Hobbs. The research currently being carried out by Reef Recovery Initiative partners, then, is all the more vital for preserving the future of reefs. Our correspondents around the region have been monitoring the air quality in their various cities. While Beijing is usually incredibly smoggy, Tom Phillips is reporting unusually blue skies and remarkably low PM2.5 readings. But when Tom descended into the subway, things didn’t look so great. Blair Palese is the chief executive of 350.org Australia. I asked her a series of questions about the climate movement here and abroad. Here’s the first question and answer: Question: The rise of Trump in the US, and the continued lack of federal action on climate change here in Australia, must be seen in some ways as a failure of the climate movement. What lessons can be learned from what’s happened in recent years and how can the climate movement win? Blair Palese: Climate change is an incredibly difficult issue for people to get their heads around. Complex, yes, but more importantly, made confusing by media with vested interests questioning climate change science – a tactic straight out of the tobacco playbook. Understanding that science is never 100% certain is not something most of us think much about, so it’s easily exploited. And, as our movement is up against the most cashed up industry in the world – the fossil fuel industry – it’s a David vs Goliath battle to convince people and politicians that the longer we wait, the harder and more expensive are the steps we must take to stop climate change. That said, those working on the issue do need to reach out more broadly to everyone, everywhere about the importance of the issue and ensure our movement spans the political, race, gender and age spectrum to be truly representative. It’s worth remembering that the People’s Climate Marches of 2015 saw more than 600,000 people take to the streets in 175 countries -- by all accounts the biggest thing of its kind in history. Our job now is not only to raise the alarm about climate change but to communicate the huge benefits we will all get from solving it. Our voices need to be loud and varied if we are to successfully stand up to fossil fuel dollars. Come back soon to see some more Q&amp;A’s with Blaire. The Homeward Bound Project aims to take 1000 women working in science around the world to Antarctica to increase their influence and impact in policy and decision-making. Belinda Fairbrother, the community conservation manager at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, was part of the inaugural contingent of 76 women to spend 22 days in Antarctica in December: the largest-ever female expedition to Earth’s southernmost continent. She said the impacts of climate change were keenly felt there, with the Antarctic peninsula was among the fastest-warming places in the world and penguin populations suffering. “It really brings home the challenges we face elsewhere in the world.” Having met scientists at Palmer Station, a US station in the Antarctic, she realised that no progress was possible alone, and that storytelling was as important as facts in mobilising people to act. “In these remote landscapes, that’s what really struck me – we need to work together, past issues and conflict. Going forward, that radical collaboration is what we’re going to need to deal with climate change as a global issue.” Hearing personal accounts of knowledgeable people experiencing the effects of climate change firsthand and working to combat them helped to mobilise her, said Fairbrother: “Data’s only going to get us so far. … Climate change is real but what’s also real is people’s innovation and ability to stand up to issues like this.” Fairbrother also said her experience had shown her that gender equity and more equal decision-making was a key part of the solution to climate change. The Homeward Bound Project aims to elevate each participant’s leadership capabilities and profile with view to addressing underrepresentation of women in positions of power and influence, “to impact policy and decisions towards a sustainable future”. There are already hundreds of women waitlisted for the second program, to depart in 2018. We started on Lizard island and went all the way to China, by way of the Tumblrverse and a possible planet populated only by carp. “There’s no time to lose”: a coral reef scientist urges governments to act on carbon emissions Street violence over water supplies not some future dystopia, but a present reality in Tamil Nadu, southern India John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, comments on the slow-moving gains of climate policy China correspondent Tom Phillips reports back from one of the largest solar farms on Earth in Qinghai province Millennial lobby group Generation Zero gets to advocates young in New Zealand The worst mangrove dieback in recorded history in Australia’s Northern Territory, and the ramifications for that coastline Smog from China aggravates a severe air pollution problem in Hong Kong Mikey Slezak looks to the future Calla Wahlquist with the latest on “fire behaviour” analysis in Victoria, Australia’s most fire-prone state China doubles down on its pledge to cut carbon emissions – no matter what the Donald may do Meanwhile, here’s the carbon countdown again – only 27.5% of the total carbon budget remaining in tons (CO2-e), if we want to to limit human-induced warming to less than 2C. And here’s a thoughtful response to CassandrasVoice’s earlier question about how long – specifically – we’ve got before climate change has severe enough impact on the majority for us to act. Li Shuo, a Beijing-based campaigner for Greenpeace, is among the activists hoping that China, the world’s largest polluter, will take up a greater leadership role on climate change in a post-Trump world. Li is an expert in clean energy, air pollution and climate change and also studied US-China relations at Nanjing University in east China. Writing in the Guardian today, Li argues that Trump’s election “casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation” but says Beijing’s apparent willingness to take on a larger role offers some hope. You can read Li’s full piece here: I recently sat down over Skype with the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, David Ritter. I pressed him on whether or not the election of Trump in the US meant that the public has stopped caring for climate change. He was adamant that was not the case. “There’s much that might be said about this election but i don’t think we can in any way treat it as a mandate for inaction,” he said. “One of the sad ironies of protest electoral votes may be that some of those who have been most left behind by an economic system that is deepening inequality, and are lashing out and voting for candidates seen as anti-establishment, are also people that are at the greatest risk from global warming when we see extreme weather events, we see extreme temperatures and so on. So I don’t think there’s any doubt that inequality and climate change are intimately, intimately connected.” Check out the full video below. And tweet your comments or thoughts to me at @mikeyslezak or to David at @David_Ritter, or leave them below in the comments. The war on global warming is “a responsibility we must assume for future generations,” Chinese president told the world’s economic elite in Davos this week, signalling that Beijing would stay true to its pledge to cut carbon emissions, even if Donald Trump did not. China has several reasons for sticking to its guns. Firstly, there is consensus in China that the country is likely to be among the biggest victims of climate change: a 2015 government report warned rising sea levels, temperatures, and rainfall posed a real and present danger to hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens. Melting glaciers in China’s extreme west and the desertification of large swaths of land in the north have set alarm bells ringing in Beijing. Secondly, Beijing understands it must take action against deadly episodes of air pollution that are fuelling increasing public rage. China’s leaders view climate change mitigation as an effective argument with which to take on the powerful energy sector responsible for the smog, which is blamed for up to one million premature deaths per year. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Beijing sees huge economic benefits in transitioning towards a consumption and services based low carbon economy and becoming a world-leader in the energy technologies of the future. Already its global dominance of the renewables market is becoming clear through billions of dollars of overseas investment last year in countries from Australia to Brazil and Pakistan. China is now the world’s largest investor in clean energy and recently unveiled plans to pump more than $360bn into renewable energy sources by 2020. Finally, there is the question of soft power. With a climate denier now occupying the White House, some in Beijing see a golden opportunity to boost China’s global standing by spearheading the war on global warming. Xi’s speech at the World Economic Forum - in which he urged the world to “meet the challenges of climate change” and praised the Paris climate deal as “a hard-won achievement” - suggests China may be preparing to do just that. “History,” the Chinese president told his audience to loud applause, “is created by the brave.” Lightning struck bushland east of the coastal Victorian town of Wye River on 19 December, 2015. On 25 December the fire burned the town, destroying 116 homes. Most of the residents had already been evacuated on the order of fire authorities, who mapped the fire behaviour, with astonishing accuracy, five days earlier. The mapping system, called Phoenix, allows fire behaviour analysts to input data about the terrain, dryness of the fuel, predicted temperatures, and predicted wind patterns, and come up with a predicted image of fire behaviour. Until 2010, this was done with considerably less accuracy using a pocket calculator and a slide-rule, crosshatching on paper maps. As fire behaviour analyst Andy Ackland explained in the video below, the mapping system also predicts the occurrence of convection currents, where a blast of hot air pushes through the inversion layer of the atmosphere. That’s one of the key conditions of a firestorm. The system is used to inform public warnings and help firefighters prioritise when there are multiple fires on the same day (bushfires tend to come in crops of 12, Emergency Management commissioner Craig Lapsley said). It is also used in a strategic sense to figure out which power lines are most likely to cause devastating bushfires. Ackland said it is increasingly used to map potential changes in bushfire risk caused by long-term climate change, which is drying out the mountain ash forests around Victoria and leaving them more prone to a severe bushfire. “Some of the most extreme fuel loads that you would see anywhere in the state are that type of mountain ash fuel,” Darrin McKenzie, deputy chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management said. Like many Australian trees, mountain ash has evolved to use fire to regenerate, shedding long ribbons of bark to create fuel. That strategy backfires in a catastrophic fire Black Saturday in February 2009, which burned hot enough to kill the mountain ash seeds and, with that, jeopardise the whole alpine ecosystem. An interesting comment below the line. Earlier today I posted an opinion piece I wrote today about panic and despair, and other emotions a lot of people feel when writing about climate change. In that piece I mention a moment I felt almost panicked, while I was half-way through James Bradley’s brilliant novel Clade, which is set a few decades in the future. Here’s something James has written for the blog today about the process of writing a book about the future of climate change, as that change was happening: Back in 2012, when I began writing the book that would become Clade a lot of what I was writing was science fiction. Although there was no question climate change was an urgent problem, or that its effects were already being felt, most of the direr predictions still lay somewhere over the horizon. Yet as I wrote a peculiar and discomfiting thing began to occur. Events I was weaving into the fabric of the novel – the release of methane from the seafloor and the permafrost, mass die-offs of wildlife, the breakup of the Antarctic ice sheets, even changes in the Earth’s rotation due to the shifting weight of melting ice – started to move out of the pages of the book and into reality. The sense of hastening intensifies with every passing day. A decade ago it was possible to say the window for stopping dangerous climate change was closing, but that’s no longer true. If you live in the Pacific, or Africa, or many other parts of the world dangerous climate change is already here. The question is no longer whether we can avert dangerous climate change but whether we can avert a runaway climate catastrophe. There are days when I wonder whether continuing to believe that might be possible isn’t simply denial, a refusal to confront the truth. Speak to any scientist working in a field connected to climate change and you will quickly encounter a deep seam of despair. What is happening is occurring so quickly, so irrevocably it often seems overwhelming. Yet another part of me knows this sort of despair is self-fulfilling. Change doesn’t come from giving up, it comes from practical action and engagement. But it also requires hope, and hope requires we believe change is possible. Hello from smoggy Hong Kong. Despite its reputation as a futuristic global city, Hong Kong has terrible air quality and the government has been slow to respond to the problem. Nearly all government pollution targets far exceed World Health Organization recommendations. In terms of PM2.5, tiny particles that cause haze and have been linked to cancer, government targets are three times higher than the WHO. Even during the best year for deadly PM2.5, levels were still more than twice WHO guidelines. Congested roads flanked by skyscrapers cause a “street canyon” effect, where pollution caused by road traffic can be trapped and recirculate, exacerbating the problem. Hong Kong’s port, one of the busiest in the world, is also a massive source of bad air. Ships are only required to switch to cleaner fuels when docked at port, so the entire journey sailing through the city’s waters is emitting high levels pollution. On top of that, almost all of Hong Kong’s power comes from fossil fuels. Lastly, let’s not forget Hong Kong’s neighbor to the north: China. Smog from China often wafts into Hong Kong, aggravating an already severe problem. About 20% of Australia’s coastline – 11,000km – is lined with 52 different species of mangroves, with more than a third of it in the Northern Territory. But last year something extraordinary occurred in the Gulf of Carpentaria, when scientists were informed of a mass dieback along a stretch about 700km long. It was the worst mangrove dieback in recorded history, covering 7,000 hectares, and came at the same time as the more highly publicised coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. Believed due to a combination of factors related to climate change, the mangrove dieback has serious ramifications for the health of that coastline and future erosion, but went largely unnoticed at the time. “Essentially the plants died because of moisture stress and that’s linked with a combination of factors,” Prof Norman Duke, an expert in mangrove ecology from James Cook University, tells the Guardian. “High temperatures obviously, a lack of rainfall, and strangely also a temporary drop in sea level at the critical time when these plants were so stressed out because of the climate itself. All these factors are related to the southern oscillation index, the El Niño southern oscillation cycles, and that means that they’re related to climate in general.” Duke says the dieback and subsequent response were pretty indicative of how the issue of climate change is dealt with in the NT. “I may not be privy to all that’s going on but from my perspective, we just have to look at the example of the die back. The only reason we know is because of concerned community members sending in pictures to me and others saying: we think something’s going wrong but nobody else is interested. That took four, five, six months in 2015 from when it was first publicised.” “It’s now well over a year since the dieback started and still there is no dedicated surveys going on on the ground to establish what has gone on, the extent of it, and what we can do about it and what are the consequences, which are potentially enormous.” When Pubudu Senanayake cycles through the Christchurch CBD he feels a quiet sense of satisfaction that New Zealanders are adapting their island home of 4.5m to be more climate-friendly. A NZ $150m cycle network in Christchurch and increased rail services in Auckland are recent wins. Senanayake is a member of youth-led lobby group Generation Zero, formed in 2011 with the aim of pushing the New Zealand government to take swifter action on climate change, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by the year 2050. He says successive governments have not “understood the urgency with which we need to act”, with emissions increasing. With over 30,000 members and high-profile, imaginative lobbying action, Generation Zero campaign as vociferously for leadership from government as they do for individual choices such as eating less meat or walking to work. A number of members, “empowered to act” while at university, have gone onto work for NGOs or in government, says Senanayake. “We try to increase youth participation in the civic process and help youth gain more skills and knowledge to have an impact at the policy level.” For Senanayake and his fellow climate warriors the pay-off is clear: a sustainable New Zealand for decades to come. “Climate change is not just an environmental issue. The symptoms are environmental but the issue is social and economic. And the urgency with which we need to take action makes me pretty devoted to it.” My colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this piece from Qinghai province in western China. Tom is back from spending two (freezing cold) days there on the Tibetan plateau visiting what is reputedly the largest solar farm on earth and one of a growing number of super-sized symbols of China’s quest to transform itself from climate villain to green superpower. “The scale of the solar park is just extraordinary and building it was clearly a huge, huge task,” says Tom. “Engineers there told me thousands of workers had taken part in construction, braving temperatures as low as -20C to turn the region into a sea of silicon panels.” You can read the full piece below and come back soon for more from Tom. John Connor has been the chief executive of the Climate Institute in Australia for 10 years. In that time, he’s seen federal climate policy begin to be established, only to be dismantled and then replaced by ongoing stagnation. I spoke with him and asked him whether the lack of movement meant the climate movement had been doing things wrong, whether Trump’s election was the death knell for the Paris Agreement, and what individuals could do to help prevent climate change. Watch the video here: Parched reservoirs, street violence over dwindling water supplies, and the emergence of a “water mafia” sound like some fevered vision of a future dystopia. Except, all three are already happening in parts of southern India, and most acutely in Tamil Nadu. One of India’s wealthiest and best developed states, Tamil Nadu is nonetheless in the grip of its worst water shortage on record. This year’s monsoon brought less than half the usual rainfall. The reservoirs that supply Chennai, the capital, are at around 13% capacity – and the state still must weather six hot months before the monsoon rains returns in July. Rural areas already appear to already be in crisis: India’s human rights agency estimates at least 106 farmers have killed themselves in the past month. It isn’t all down to climate change. “The way Tamil Nadu is geographically rendered denies it access to precipitation,” says Jayshree Vencatesan, the managing trustee at the environmental group, Care Earth Trust. Mismanagement of crops and existing water resources also takes some share of the blame. But the annual monsoon season, the state’s lifeline, is bringing less rain than it used to. And when it does finally pour, the storms are intense and brutal, causing destructive floods of the kind that have ravaged Chennai each December of the past two years, killing over 300 people. And though researchers are yet to study the link, Vencatesan says the state is “consistently warmer” than in the past. “You don’t really have a great seasonality. So, you have a monsoon, that’s followed by an intense summer – and there’s an immediate drying up of the system,” she says. Tamil Nadu has been forced to beg surrounding states for help. In September, it won a legal battle with neighbouring Karnataka state for more access to water from the Cauvery, a river the two states share. But Karnataka too is desperately thirsty. The result was days of anti-Tamil violence in the streets of the Karnataka capital, Bangalore, including the torching of dozens of Tamil-owned vehicles and businesses. Demonstrators carried signs that read: “We will give blood, but not Cauvery.” Some unscrupulous water-tanker drivers have begun to exploit the situation. Vencatasan says hundreds are involved in buying water from farmers, and hauling it to villages where supplies are low. There they hock it for a steep markup. “They haven’t reached the point of forming cartels yet,” Vencatasan says. “But they are a water mafia.” We’ve collaborated with Tumblr to create a “quilt” of user-submitted messages and artwork about climate change for this Global Warning project. Here’s my new favourite submission: “A world full of carp is probably not the long-term goal”. Let us know if you disagree in the comments! After speaking with Anne Hoggett about the devastating bleaching that hit the Great Barrier Reef, I asked her what she thinks individuals can do to help stop climate change to protect the reef from bleaching. Here’s what she said: Let our government know that you want them to take meaningful action to contain carbon emissions - now. There’s no time to lose. Throughout the afternoon, we’re going to hear from a number of people about what they think individuals can do to help stop climate change. I’ve got to say, the hours are flying by as we steer the live blog back to London. It’s 1pm here in Sydney, it’s pouring down with rain, and Mikey Slezak has just inhaled a cheeseburger in between blog posts. In the past hour: Guardian Australia’s photographer extraordinaire Mike Bowers shared a shot and a story from his trip to Kiribati, featuring prominently in our coverage today as a site on the bleeding-edge of rising sea levels Jason Roberts answered just one more question for us from Casey Station in Antarctica My colleague Calla Wahlquist reported back on how Victoria, the most fire-prone state in Australia, approaches bushfire management David Tong, now of WWF New Zealand, gave a chilling account of household items being taken by rising sea levels in Kiribati – and locals putting sugar in their water “to counteract the salty taste” We heard from Lock the Gate, a group of Astralian farmers concerned about coal mining and gas extraction Michael Safi, the Guardian’s Asia correspondent, reported from Delhi on plans for the largest electricity rollout in history Even the Sydney Opera House faces problems posed by climate change, Guardian Australia’s Joshua Robertson found A coral reef biologist who’s been based on Lizard Island in far north Queensland for almost three decades reports back on the challenges Here’s a talking point for you to deliberate in the comments: Onwards and upwards. Yesterday I spoke with coral reef biologists Anne Hoggett. She’s lived and worked on Lizard Island in remote far North Queensland for almost three decades. She is now director of the Australian Museum’s research station there. Lizard Island was at the epicentre of the disastrous bleaching that killed about a fifth of the coral on the entire Great Barrier Reef. Check out the interview below, where Anne describes what it has been like living there, and watching the impacts of climate change hit her remote home. The business case for adapting to climate change has dawned on a growing number of organisations in Australia, including the stewards of the Sydney Opera House. The opera house is among the 10 best business cases in Australia to show how it could be done, according to a Griffith University report launched last month. The climate change risks to the World Heritage-listed building range from underground water leaks from rising sea levels and water pressure, damage from more severe storms with high winds, and flooding from more intense rainfall and run-off. The opera house has now factored in a 90cm sea level rise into its 10-yearly building renewal program. Managers told the Griffith researchers that assuming the need for climate change adaptation in its investments was a responsible “use of taxpayers’ money”. Other cases include the insurer Suncorp, which sees a growing cost of natural disasters in northern Australia in the form of cyclones, floods and hail storms as “the game changer and catalyst for change and action”. Over the last seven years in Queensland alone, insurers paid out $1.44 in claims for every $1 they collected in premiums, the study said. After Queensland’s costly 2011 floods, Suncorp assessed the cost of a levee to protect the flood-prone town of Roma at $11m – the same as it cost the government to provide emergency helicopter rescues for one flood. “This presented a very strong business case for the [Queensland] government to fund the levee, which they did,” the study said. Suncorp told the researchers that while the insurance industry has a “pretty good understanding of what the cost will look like”, this did not necessarily extend to the human costs, which are only apparent when disaster hits and insurers “turn up on the ground and start helping people rebuild their homes”. “At that point, it becomes evident that there is a range of risks and damages that are not ‘carried on anyone’s balance sheet’, for instance, mental health issues,” the study said. AlexMourinho raises an interesting point: could the way forward from our changing climate be posed by philosophy? On the subject of science intersecting with philosophy, on Wednesday I went scuba-diving off the north shore of Sydney with Peter Godfrey-Smith, an academic philosopher who’s written a book about the consciousness of cephalopods. Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness is currently available in the US and due for release in the UK and Australia in February; Godfrey-Smith’s New York Times column about octopuses and ageing is a taster. Hello from Delhi, India’s heaving capital, where, inside government ministries, plans are being devised for the largest electricity rollout in history. India will need to supply power to nearly 600m new consumers by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. How they choose to do so matters to the entire planet. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, takes climate change seriously. Extreme weather across the country, including droughts, storms, and the severest heat wave on record killed nearly 1,600 Indians, it was reported this week. Food yields are already estimated to have fallen by 6% because of higher temperatures – a phenomenon that might claim 160,000 Indian lives each year by 2050. But Modi is also emphatic that climate change “is not of [India’s] making”. Historically, the country accounts for just 3% of the world’s total carbon emissions since 1890. India is unapologetic about potentially tripling its coal use by 2030 if it means connecting every village to the grid and powering new schools, jobs and homes for hundreds of millions of its citizens. Averting a catastrophic increase in carbon emissions will come down to how much of that energy can be generated cleanly. India’s renewable energy target is hugely ambitious: an installed capacity of 175GW by 2022. To put that into perspective, the current capacity of India’s entire grid is around 310GW. So far, India doesn’t appear to be on track to hit the 175GW target – but that’s missing the point. In pursuit of such a bold aim, it has already added nearly 15GW in renewable capacity, and attracted billions of dollars in investment. The southern state of Tamil Nadu is now the site of one of the world’s largest solar power plants. India’s total renewable capacity could increase by more than 50% in the next year alone. It has already predicted it will exceed its Paris targets by nearly 60% – and do so three years early. So, while the next posts will explore the threats posed by climate change to India, it’s worth remembering: there’s some cause for optimism, too. Lock the Gate is a large group of farmers and other citizens concerned about coal mining and gas extraction. They’ve successfully fought coal seam gas extraction along the east coast of Australia, and have emerged as a force to be reckoned with. The group has just released an analysis suggesting coal mining is responsible for about half the dangerous particulate pollution in New South Wales. Georgina Woods is the New South Wales campaign coordinator at Lock the Gate and has sent this in: As well as dealing with more extreme droughts as global warming worsens, regional communities in Australia are suffering localised impacts of coal mining. Lock the Gate Alliance, a network of community groups protecting their land and water from coal and gas mining, has today released analysis showing coal mining is responsible for the majority of dangerous particulate air pollution in New South Wales. Roughly half of this is created by five of the biggest mines. They’re all in the Hunter Valley – an important agricultural region, which is home to renowned wineries and horse studs. The state’s most-polluting coal mines are choking the Hunter Valley’s skies, damaging the health of local people and their children, contributing to the hundreds of deaths in NSW that are caused every year by particulate pollution. This analysis is part of Lock the Gate’s submission to the NSW’s government’s Clean Air Plan, which closes for consultation today. A big-picture question posed by CassandrasVoice in the comments: how long have we got? It’s a tough one, but if you’ve got thoughts or ideas, we’d love to hear them. We’ve heard about the impact of rising sea levels in Kiribati, and Guardian Australia’s Mike Bowers’ personal recollection of his visit there – now David Tong, now a campaigner at WWF in New Zealand, has written about his time in South Tarawa, an atoll of only 16 sq km of land, last September. It’s quite a chilling account of living on the front line of rising sea waters. “Climate change impacts are real and obvious. On my first day in Bairiki, I walked along the beach behind the President’s house. The sea wall was broken in several places, and the beach was littered with rubbish. I couldn’t understand where all the rubbish came from – were the broken TVs from passing cruise ships or something? “My I-Kiribati colleagues explained that the rubbish on the beaches had mostly come from people’s houses. With the highest point on Tarawa only 3m above sea level, storm surges and king tides flood homes, pulling people’s property back with them. Over the following weeks and months, the sea dumps its takings back on the beaches.” David Tong said that a storm surge following Cyclone Pam flooded South Tarawa’s maternity hospital, with flooding reaching hundreds of metres inland, killing pandanus trees and destroying taro pits. “I heard talk of people putting sugar in their water, to counteract the salty taste. ... Already on Abiang, the nearest outlying island to Tarawa, salt water is bubbling up from the soil at king tides.” I-Kiribati are working to develop salt-resistant crops, and President Mamau has pledged to make a plan for every community and every island. “Our choices in the rich world will decide whether that’s possible,” said David Tong, who’s returning to Kiribati in February: “The place gets under your skin.” Victoria, the most fire-prone state in Australia, overhauled its emergency management model following the devastating Black Saturday bushfires of 9 February 2009, which killed 173 people and destroyed two small alpine towns. The result was a new control structure, Emergency Management Victoria, which operates out of the State Control Centre in Melbourne. On a day with a fire danger rating of extreme or above, or in the event of a natural disaster, the room fills up with the heads of Victoria’s fire and flood agencies. Steve Riley, manager of the centre, talked us through it. Here’s the interview: We’re going to wrap up our Q&amp;A with Jason Roberts in Antarctica now. Thanks to everyone for all the excellent questions. And thanks especially to Jason for taking the time out of his research down there to engage with us all. Apologies to those answers we didn’t get to. To close it off, here’s one last question and answer. And Jason’s answer: This is a question that we hear often, and it’s great that people are still asking it, and want to know the answer. There is some confusion around this due to the changing amount of sea ice, and confusion between it and grounded ice. The area of sea ice is changing, due mainly to changes in the ocean currents and wind, moving the sea ice around and packing it together in areas. The ice on Antarctica (the so called grounded ice) is decreasing. Like any big land mass, things vary from area to area, but overall Antarctica is losing ice. We have several independent lines of evidence to support that. The most direct way is that satellites and aircraft (including the project I’m currently in Antarctica working on) measure the height of the surface of the ice sheet using lasers and radars. They show that many of the outlet glaciers and surrounding ice catchments are lowering, which can only happen if they are losing ice. The second way is that the gravitational field of the ice can be measured from space, we can “weigh the ice sheet” and it is weighing less over time. Again like any big area, things can change from year to year, but overall the pattern is that Antarctica is losing grounded ice, and especially the smaller (and therefore quicker to respond to any changes) West Antarctic region. Kiribati: The 33 atolls and reef islands straddle the equator and are spread across an area of over 3 million square miles. The eastern Line Islands are the first place in the world to greet the sun everyday as the international date line has to bend around them so that they are on the same day as the rest of the group. For the population of 100,000 the issues facing them are complex and urgent. Extreme weather events, storm surges and tides are eroding and threatening the precious land space. More than half the population live on the main island of Tarawa. The delicate fresh water supplies that sit underneath most of the islands in what is called a water “lens” which is basically fresh water that floats on the denser salt water that surrounds the islands. The encroaching sea is making much of this supply brackish and in some cases unusable, it is also affecting the soils and in some villages the former growing areas have become a saline desert which will not support any life. Garbage and leaching from heavy metals which lie all over the islands also contaminate the precious water supplies. The infant and under 5 mortality rate sits at a shocking 56 deaths per 1000 live births (2015 UN Inter agency group) In 2014 the Kiribati Government purchased about 20 square kilometres on the island of Vanua Levu in Fiji to for Agricultural projects and fish farming. For the people of Kiribati climate change is not an argument, they live with the changes every day in complex ways that make their lives difficult and their future uncertain. They seem genuinely surprised when you tell them that there are people in Australia who don’t believe that anything is happening to the climate of the world. As I photographed Toani Benson standing in water on the ruins of a shop on Abaiang Island where he used to fill his scooter as a school child in the mid nineties remarked “perhaps you should bring those people here.” This photograph shows children bathing in one of these shallow wells in South Tarawa. Over the last 60 minutes – Readers have had their sometimes fairly technical questions about Antarctica answered by Jason Roberts via email, direct from Casey Station – thanks to Jason and the Australian Antarctic Division for their contribution Roberts commented on the seasonal closure of the British Antarctic Survey’s Halley VI research station on the Brunt Ice Shelf, announced earlier this week as a result of uncertainty over cracks in the ice We flagged a march in Sydney on Saturday, organised by Greenpeace Australia to coincide with Donald Trump’s inauguration Mikey Slezak and WWF Australia together made you even more aware of penguins on Penguin Awareness Day (let us know when you’d like us to stop) Mikey let his professionalism give way to panic (and let me just say, if Mikey’s panicking – so should the rest of us) Responding to Eleanor Ainge Roy’s report from New Zealand, a reader shared a graph of 400,000 years’ data to show that the worst may be yet to come And we heard from Lisa Gershwin about how climate change may affect jellyfish To come: reporting from Australia and we’ll venture into Asia. As Matthew2012 references below the line, a British research station in Antarctica has decided to relocate its 16 staff who were due to stay there over winter due to uncertainty over growing cracks in the ice. The British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on Monday that the Halley VI research station would shut down over winter due to concerns over changes to the Brunt ice shelf. A station relocation further inland away from the chasm is already underway. Jason Roberts says: Yeah, I saw in the news about Halley VI research station having to close down over winter. The biggest factors working in Antarctica are safety and looking after the environment. You are a long way/time away from any outside help, so you need to do things properly and in a safe manner. I have never visited Halley, but imagine that it has been designed so that it can be closed down over winter and then brought back into operational order next summer, when conditions will be more favourable. The three Australian Antarctic research stations are built on rock, so luckily we don’t have to deal with this issue. I wish our British colleagues every luck with the relocation of Halley. Thanks to BettyLousGettinOut for bringing this story from 2014 to my attention. I feel quite grateful to be reporting in relative comfort from the office in Sydney (today: overcast, grey). I’ve been in touch with Australian Jellyfish expert, Lisa-Ann Gershwin – Director of the Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services. She’s written this Facebbok post for us, discussing the threat of Jellyfish taking over as the climate warms. While there’s been a lot of talk of jellyfish doing well and filling the oceans, she says not all jellyfish will be winners. Another answer from Antarctica. Jason Roberts said: That’s a very good question, and slightly outside my field of study, which is strictly Antarctica, but I’ll have a go at answering it. I think there is some evidence of older ice in Greenland than 123,000 years, but none that has been successfully recovered in an ice core, and more importantly dated. In general Greenland is much closer to the equator than Antarctica, and is more sensitive to warming air temperatures, so we think that during extended warm periods it would be a much smaller ice sheet and not extend to the coast like it currently does. When you drill an ice core, because of the way the ice had flowed over tens of thousands of years, the layers of ice that fell in any year get thinner and thinner, making it much more difficult to date the bottom of an ice core. In addition, the ice slowly moves so it can get folded up (think of the patterns your can see in rocks in road cuttings), and this disturbance in the ice at the bottom can make it very hard to use the very bottom of an ice core. Another factor for Greenland is that it is much smaller than Antarctica, so it just takes less time for the flowing ice to move to the edge and be lost to the ocean. So the ice gets replaced over much shorter timescales than in Antarctica. The geothermal energy question is good. In fact there is liquid water found at the base of Greenland in places, including the NEEM core which reached the folded ice from the last interglacial period. So yes, this is also a factor – mostly it is just a question of how long it takes for new snow to completely move to the bottom of the ice and get discharged at the edges. Trust that answered your question, Matthew2012. I must admit, I’m impressed by the level of technical knowledge being displayed below the line... Below the line, Erik Frederiksen has responded to a quote from Dr Sharon Hornblow, a natural risks analyst from the Otago Regional Council, in Eleanor Ainge Roy’s report from Dunedin, New Zealand. (The graph of 400,000 years of data Erik meant to link to is here.) Eleanor noted that 2016 was the hottest year on record for New Zealand, with droughts in the North Island and 11m of rain on the west coast of the South Island. Eleanor is based in Dunedin and says the southern university town is being seen as a litmus test for how the rest of the country may fare in the coming years, with numerous flat, low-lying beach side communities built on marshy land mere metres above the sea. “It all comes down to the fact that New Zealanders love to live by the ocean,” Dr Hornblow told Eleanor. “But if we were planning those homes with the wisdom we have today, we would not have people living there at all, or be building on those flat areas so close to the sea.” I don’t normally write about personal things, but recently I’ve been thinking about people’s emotional responses to the devastation that climate change has been causing – and will cause in the future. For years I’ve understood the crisis we’re facing, but I’ve managed to maintain a kind of professional distance from it – not feeling enormously strong emotions about it. But recently that’s change. Here are my thoughts about why. A question from Twitter this time, about a reported increase of ice and snow in Antarctica. Jason Roberts responds: Like anything involving such a big area as Antarctica, things vary a lot across the continent. From an Australian context, just think about floods and bushfires happening at the same time. In general Antarctica as a whole is losing some ice, with this mainly happening in West Antarctica (the bit on the South American side of the Trans Antarctic Mountains). On the larger East Antarctic side, things are a bit more in balance, with some areas losing ice, and some currently gaining ice through extra snowfall. Of course getting detailed measurements is difficult in Antarctica (there are only a few weather stations) so we rely a lot on satellites to make these measurements, so there is some uncertainty about just how large some of the changes are. To make things harder, things are changing with time as well – again, just think in an Australian context, some years are wetter than others. In Sydney Australia, there is going to be a march on the first full day after Trump is inaugurated. Greenpeace and other NGOs will be there marching to demonstrate on both climate change, and women’s rights. Another missive from the Casey Station on Antarctica. Jason Roberts: That’s an interesting question about the sea ice, and one that keeps coming up. While the air temperature and temperature at the surface of the ocean is important in forming sea ice, probably the biggest factor controlling how much sea ice is around Antarctica is the ocean currents (and the wind patterns over the water). These move the sea ice around, and can cause it to build up in certain areas as it all gets pushed together. Once this happens, it can influence the ocean, for example waves get damped out by the sea ice, which stop them breaking up the sea ice. So it is more to do with the changes in ocean and wind patterns than temperature. There isn’t much direct coupling between the changes in the sea ice and ice on the continent. Most Antarctic sea is only one year old (although there are areas of so-called “multi-year sea ice”), while the ice on the continent is much older, tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The things that affect the ice on the continent are the amount of snow that falls to replenish it, the air temperature over summer for melting it, and how stable the ice shelves are that help hold back the glaciers. Keep your questions coming below the line. WWF Australia has jumped on the penguin awareness day bandwagon too, and included a some punny jokes in their Facebook post. Jason Roberts of the Australian Antarctic Division has replied to CgGc13’s question below the line on the impact of the breaking up of the Lambert ice sheet. Jason says: The ice shelf that has a major rift in it is the Larsen ice shelf. Parts of this ice shelf collapsed around 10 years ago, that time is just disintegrated, while this time in looks like calving a big iceberg. The previous collapse reduced the forces holding back the glaciers that feed this ice shelf, and the speed up (more than doubling their speed) in the following years, although I think the most recent studies are showing that they are starting to slow back down. We can probably expect similar behaviour when this shelf calves this time. On a global scale, the glaciers feeding the Larsen are fairly small and don’t contain a huge amount of ice. But their significance is more that they are the canary in the coal mine, showing us how vulnerable these ice shelves are to changes in the surrounding ocean. Another hour has passed – here’s what we’ve covered: 20 January being Penguin Awareness Day, we’ve duly raised your awareness of penguins (let us know below the line if you’d like to be made more... aware) We heard how residents of the Solomon islands are working to strengthen forests, mangroves, reefs and other natural ecosystems that provide natural barriers to climate change How a seawall constructed in 1880 in Dunedin, in New Zealand’s South Island, has proved an inadequate barrier given contemporary challenges The Australian Antarctic Division’s Jason Roberts on his daily flights out over Antarctica – and what he sees And a selection of your thoughtful, interesting comments – please keep them coming! As Mikey mentioned, we’re about to hear from Jason for a real-time interview conducted – hopefully not-at-all haphazardly – between the Casey Station on Antarctica and the Guardian offices in Sydney. We’ve passed a selection of questions you’ve already left for him in the comments, but do send on some more. As mentioned below, we have Jason Roberts on standby at Casey Station in Antarctica ready to answer your questions about his work (see previous post), about Antarctica, or anything else! Fire your questions at us in the comments below or tweet them to me at @mikeyslezak. We’ll get them to Roberts and post the answers shortly. Jason Roberts is currently living and working at the Australian Antarctic Division’s Casey Station on Antarctica. Speaking exclusively with the Guardian this week, Roberts explained why he takes a plane out over Antarctica each day, measuring what’s underneath the ice. The work is trying to understand what controls changes in the ice, as the climate warms. “The last time we were in what’s called an interglacial - when we didn’t have the big ice sheets in the northern hemisphere – that was about 120,000 years ago when the climate was about what it’s like now,” Roberts says. “And all the evidence from around the world suggests that sea level was several meters higher than where it currently is.” But where exactly all that sea level rise came from is a mystery Roberts is trying to solve. Check out the interview we prepared earlier. NOTE: We have Roberts on standby, ready to answer your questions. Leave them in the comments below, or tweet them to @mikeyslezak and we’ll come back here with his responses. This comment, from NoMoreMrNice, praises the live blog form as a means of capturing the complexity of climate change. (In the interests of balance, I’ll try single out some critical comments soon, don’t worry!) As NoMoreMrNice notes, one of the challenges of reporting on climate change is making it seem like an immediate issue that’s unfolding now, rather than something intangible, far away in the future. These real-time, around-the-world updates are giving – if you’ll excuse the buzzword – a holistic view of the problem. A few commenters have suggested that we should run the blog for another 24 hours, or at least do so more regularly – though it’s dependant on resourcing of our offices in London, New York and Sydney, the warm response below the line is certainly an incentive to do so! St Clair beach in Dunedin is threatened by sea level rise. The first seawall was constructed in 1880 to protect the homes and businesses of low-lying South Dunedin, land which experts say should never have been built upon. The original seawall is evident in this picture, and was made of loose rocks and debris. The current wall is made of concrete and is six metres high. It is a great place to eat fish and chips while watching the pacific ocean hurl itself against the man-made barrier. “We have a duty and responsibility to inform people about what risks they face living in a coastal environment,” says Dr Sharon Hornblow, a natural risks analyst for the Otago Regional Council. “With the issue of sea-level rise we are looking at big storms increasing in frequency and severity...so people that would ordinarily have a fairly low risk of being flooded by the sea may now expect that adverse event to happen every ten years rather than every 100 years.” Thanks for all your comments below the line – it’s great to see so lively a discussion. This, from Uli Nagelb, was interesting in light of earlier debate over reference to “climate deniers” in the US: Earlier in the blog, we referred to “climate sceptics (or doubters, if you prefer that word)”; challenged in the comments, my colleague Emily Wilson had this to say: It goes to show how loaded this debate continues to be in the face of apparently indisputable facts. The question of how to bridge the gaps between the two groups remains, as pointed out in this highlighted comment: That’s something that we aim to keep at the forefront of our minds in our coverage of climate change, far beyond singular initiatives such as these. (While it’s great to see the suggestions we keep the blog going for longer, I don’t think Mikey Slezak would be very happy with me for committing to another 24-hour stint – as passionate as he is about rising seawaters.) Last year five islands in the Solomon islands were consumed by rising oceans. The impoverished Oceanic nation, home to 640,000 people, has seen annual sea levels rise by as much as 10mm in the last 20 years; Choiseul Province, home to 20,000 people, was forced to relocate its provincial hub. Fred Patison, the country manager for the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, says residents of Choiseul were attempting to strengthen their ecosystems to reinforce their natural safeguards against climate change. Speaking via Facebook messenger from his office in the capital Honiara, Patison says the Solomons have limited resources, so helping the local people preserve and care for their native forests, reefs and mangroves is the most straightforward action. “Ecosystem-based adaptation” is, for now, affordable and easily communicated – “although at some point relocation may become an option.” He adds that the Solomons were getting uncomfortably hot – a trend noted in other Pacific islands. According to Sydney Aquarium, today is penguin awareness day. As they point out, penguins are threatened by climate change as ice melts and sea level rises. And for your enjoyment, the Australian Antarctic Division have posted this adorable video of penguins being, well, penguins. (And soon we’ll be heading to Antarctica, hearing from a scientist working there right now.) Good morning from Sydney, Australia – my name is Elle Hunt and I’m helping Mikey Slezak co-pilot the blog in its final eight-hour stretch. In the past hour, we’ve learned about: the impact of rising sea levels in the low-lying Pacific island of Kiribati how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now (warning: this carbon countdown clock, updating in real time, may spike your anxiety) the latest on the toxic debate about renewable energy in Australia. The good news: voters aren’t convinced that it’s forcing prices up Coming up, we’ll head to Antarctica with Jason Roberts of the Australian Antarctic Division, who will be joining us for a real-time Q&amp;A from 11am AEDT. Watch his upcoming video interview and let us know what questions you have for him in the comments or on Twitter: I’m @mlle_elle, Mikey’s @MikeySlezak, and the hashtag we’re using is #GlobalWarning. Thanks for joining us. Here in Australia, there’s been a toxic debate about renewable energy. The fossil fuel industry, conservative media and the coalition government have been trying to link blackouts in South Australia, which have been caused by extreme weather, to the high proportion of renewables in that state. They’ve also been arguing that rising power bills around the country are a result of increases in renewable energy in the grid. But today, just as another extreme storm causes a large blackout in South Australia, we have polling from GetUp showing Australians have not been swayed by these arguments. Just over 17% of voters said they thought renewable energy was to blame for rising power prices. Read the full story here: This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. I’ve calculated that in just the 24 hour lifespan of this blog, the world will pump out more than 112m tons (CO2-e). You can embed the clock on your own website as well by using the code from the embed button (that’s the purple one with as the symbol). First up, we’re starting in the low-lying island of Kiribati. My colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy has filed this from New Zealand: Kiribati’s climate change officer Choi Yeeting says there are no climate deniers in his island home - because the population of 100,000 people in the central Pacific ocean see the devastating effects of climate change everyday, which in this low-lying atoll nation include rising sea-waters, extensive coastal erosion, increasing temperatures, prolonged droughts and severe fresh water shortages. “Technically speaking, we are planning ahead that one day we may have to leave our home,” said Yeeting. “But on the other side of that is a nationalist pride that comes with being an individual from Kiribati and not wanting to go down without a fight. People are trying to think positively and adapt, because leaving our home is the worst-case scenario.” Former President and renowned climate change activist Anote Tong says when there is a king tide and a moderate westerly wind blowing there is frequent damage to villages and homes, with crops destroyed and fresh water wells tainted. During his time in office (which ended last year), Tong became famous in the climate change community for taking strong, preventative action to prepare his country for the worst, including building sea walls, buying “fall-back” land in Fiji if Kiribati residents were one day forced to migrate, and investigating the feasibility of building a floating island. Tong is adamant that the initial purchase of the land in Fiji was an “investment decision” but since Kiribati’s fate has become more dire, Tong says the Fijian government and its people have stepped forward with open arms. “I have never been in support of our people being given the status of climate refugees. And the reason I say that is we have more than enough time to prepare. And I have always advocated a policy of migration with dignity.” he says. “But the Fiji government and the people have come forward to say Fiji would welcome people from Tuvalu, and Kiribati, if they should ever need a place to go to. And I think that is the moral response that I have been looking for from the international community. So that should be put on record for someone acting in a humanitarian, moral way to a challenge that is going to mean the destruction of homes, culture and people.” Before we move on – a quick update for new readers about what we’re doing here. Just ahead of a climate sceptic moving into the White House, we’re producing 24 hours of reporting on climate change happening now. We began with the blog being piloted from London, and had reporting from Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The reins were then taken over by our colleagues in the US, who delivered reporting from the Americas. And here we are now in Australia, bringing you reporting from everywhere between India and Kiribati. It’s not all doom and gloom – we have reports about communities fighting climate change, about reasons to be hopeful and posts about what you can do to help limit global warming. Keep checking back in and let us know what you’re thinking on twitter or below the line. Hello from Sydney, Australia. From the office here, we’re going to drive the blog for the next nine hours, taking it through to the 24 hour mark. As the sun is now moving over the Asia Pacific, we’ll bing you reporting from Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Australia, China, Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia, India and lots of places in between. We’ll also turn to Antarctica, and give you the opportunity to fire questions to a climate scientist who is there now, in the middle of a major research project. You’ll hear from people living on the frontlines of climate change around the region, as well as people at the frontline of the fight against climate change. I’ll be asking some leaders of the climate movement if having a climate denier in the White House, and little progress on climate action in Australia, is a sign the movement is failing. I’ll bring you a video interview with a scientist working on the frontline of climate change in Antarctica – and give you an opportunity to ask him questions for yourself. But we want to hear from YOU. Let me know what’s happening with climate change around you, or how you might be preparing for it or fighting it. Tweet me @mikeyslezak or leave a comment below the line. We’ll try to feature as many of your inputs as we can. As Amanda Holpuch and Ashifa Kassam reported earlier, climate change will have cascading effects from forests in the American south-east to the far reaches of Canada. Brazil’s leading monitor of the Amazon told Jonathan Watts about the threat of cattle ranchers to the Amazon, and attorney Lauren Kurtz told Alan Yuhas about a campaign to help climate scientists protect themselves under the administration of Donald Trump. We’re also going to pass the baton to Michael Slezak and Elle Hunt in Sydney, Austraila, for the final sweep of climate change coverage around the world Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away More from Paulo Barret, head of Imazon, the world’s leading monitor of the Amazon rainforest. It has been argued that indigenous reserves have the best protected forest. Is that true from what you have observed? Indigenous lands and many Conservation Units (such as National Parks and National Forest) are the best protected areas. The indigenous peoples that are more protective are the ones that maintained their ancient livelihoods practices, which are dependent on healthy environment such as hunting, fishing and small scale agriculture. By being present in the areas, they also prevent timber extraction by loggers. Unfortunately, Congress wants to amend the constitution to make it harder to acknowledge land rights for indigenous people. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would review all demarcations of this type by Funai (The National Indian Foundation), which will further politicise the process. What more could be done in Brazil? INPE, the National Space Agency, uses satellite images to report the annual rate of deforestation and also to produce monthly alerts on hotspots of deforestation. Data from the latter – which is named DETER – is provided to the federal environmental agency to guide field inspections. Overall, the system works well, but in the past three years the government stopped publishing DETER’s data to the general public. The new Environment Minister has promised to resume monthly publication. The government should also resume the policies that had been effective including improving enforcement, implement and increase the area of Conservation Units. Additionally, government and private sector should work more on incentives for conservation, especially for small landholders. Finally, government should collect the land tax that would curb speculative deforestation and land grabbing. Looking 20 years into the future, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the Amazon? The best scenario would combine the implementation of policies that have been effective with new ones, such as incentives for conservation, with the aim of keeping the existing forest. But it is also necessary to invest in restoration given that Brazil has an estimated 28 million hectares of legal forest deficit in the whole country – about half of that in the Amazon. However, Brazil has promised to reforest only 12 million hectares up to 2030 as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. The worst scenario would be the continuation of weak government and a private sector that fails to understand the importance of forest conservation to sustainable development and fails to execute their stated commitment to zero deforestation. In that case, deforestation and forest fires would continue and we could lose 30% by 2050. That would take the forest to turning point, after which it could lose the capacity to regenerate due a combination of drier climate and frequent forest fires. Personally, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the prospects for the Amazon? I am very concerned because of the financial and political crises in Brazil that are likely to last for several years. To offset this, the private sector and the international community should increase their support for forest conservation. For example, large corporations that committed to zero-deforestation should work closely with Brazilian authorities and landholders to curb deforestation. The Amazon contains half the world’s remaining rainforest, with an estimated 390bn trees doing the work of storing carbon and regulating the climate. Deforestation is removing those natural air filters. Early this century, an area the size of Albania was being cleared every year. Since then, the good news is that Brazil, which contains 60% of the Amazon, has taken action to slow deforestation. But pressures on the forest are growing again. I asked Paulo Barreto, the head of Imazon, the leading independent Amazon monitoring organisation, to give me an update on the situation. Your organisation uses satellite data to measure deforestation. What do the recent results tell us? The rate of deforestation decreased nearly 80% from 2005 to 2012. But from 2012 to 2016, deforestation rates increased 75% going from 4,571 to 7,989 square kilometres. Can you explain why progress has faltered? Deforestation rates increased because after 2012 Congress and the government weakened the environmental laws by pardoning some of the illegal deforestation, reduced Conservation Units, built large infrastructure project without proper environmental licensing procedures and decreased the enforcement of environmental law. An interactive map by Global Forest Watch tracks the change in forest cover since 2001. It is impressively grim. The pink (decline) areas are far more prominent than the blue (increase) areas. What does this mean for the climate? This means that the Amazon is a large contributor to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases when the forest is burned. In fact, deforestation is responsible for about half of the Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions. Which areas have the most rapid deforestation ? Cattle ranching accounts for 65% of the deforested areas in the Amazon. Deforestation is facilitated by large infrastructure projects, which facilitated transport and attract immigration. In the past five years, this has happened near Belo Monte dam in Altamira and along the BR-163 highway in eastern Pará State and near Porto Velho, Rondônia State, where two dams have been built. On a more positive note, which areas are seeing reforestation ? Most reforestation has been by natural regeneration of forests in abandoned pasturelands. Usually, these lands are in areas with poor potential for land use intensification such as riparian areas or zones with high rainfall. Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to “save” coal mining, holding rallies where he mimed shoveling and accused Barack Obama of doing “everything he can to kill the coal industry”. Surrounded by advisers who oppose climate regulations, Trump will soon be able to hack through the rules put in place by Obama to curtail pollution. Saving coal, however, is likely out of beyond his powers. The free market, far more than regulations, has done the work of killing coal. Despite Trump’s insistence that the US is struggling for energy, the natural gas industry has created a supply glut so significant it has cut deeply into the economies of entire nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia among them. Coal couldn’t compete. Cheaper and cleaner than coal, though – not renewable or green – natural gas operations mushroomed all over the US over the last decade, so much so that they started creating earthquakes and short-lived boomtowns. Trump’s proposals would open up the US for even more gas exploration. Coal only accounts for about 30% of US electricity, down from about 50% in 2008, and its decline traces back several decades. The industry has lost about 200,000 jobs since 1980 as machines replaced humans in the mines, and as those mines delved into deeper, more expensive and dangerous mountains. Exports peaked in 2012, alongside the high points of growth in China, which has its own coal supplies and has now turned toward cleaner energy. Investment banks have also continued to back away from the industry as renewable technology has become cheaper. Clean energy is a hot topic for the political and business bigwigs who gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum this week. The forum has added more sessions on the subject (along with climate change) than ever before. That’s not surprising, given that solar and wind energy no longer represents mostly a badge of environmental activism. We are seeing an increasing number of companies, including Google, Apple and Ikea, that sign contracts to buy renewable electricity or even build their own solar and wind farms. That’s because the prices for these once-expensive sources of energy have dived since 2009, with 63% drop for solar contracts in the US over the past five years. Renewable energy investments, which also include geothermal and biomass, increased from $40.1bn in 2015 to $42.7bn in 2016 in the US, according to a new report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Solar being cheaper than coal? This was once unthinkable. Now, it’s already happening in some corners of the world and could spread to just about everywhere by 2025. Ashifa Kassam, the Guardian’s Canada correspondent this week sent us this dispatch from Lennox Island, off the coast of Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada. On Lennox, she wrote, the island has lost 400 acres in just a few generations and the First Nations community is wondering if it has a future. Kassam reports that over the past three decades, Danny Tuplin has watched the island’s shoreline inch closer to his two-storey house. Only a few years ago, his home sat 10ft from the water. Then in 2004, a hurricane-strength nor’easter blizzard brought the ocean to his doorstep.“I went out the back door, I took five steps and I was in salt water,” said the 58-year-old. Touching on similar issues, we have a comment piece by Julian Brave NoiseCat, an enrolled member of the Canim Lake Band Tsq’escen in British Columbia, who says the cornerstone of the climate justice movement must be indigenous rights and sovereignty. Earlier today we published this piece by Brave NoiesCat in which he writes: “Many believe the fight to combat climate change hinges on the aligned interests of capital and state. Give the Elon Musks of the world enough time and resources and they will innovate us out of impending climate catastrophe. Get the G20 in a room and they will hammer out a deal and create regulations to enforce it. Or so the thinking in some circles goes. Yet throughout history, the interests of the state have slid into alignment with big oil and big profits rather than lining up with our rivers, our air, our wildlife and our people. On Friday, men who disavow climate change and profit mightily from fossil fuels will take charge. In a global race to the bottom, there’s no telling how far downriver these shortsighted profiteers will sell our future generations. Elsewhere on our Comment site today, commissioned for our climate blog, we have a piece by Osprey Orielle Lake, who is marching against Trump on Saturday and argues there is a link between violence against women and the Earth. At the largest gathering of earth scientists in the world last month, a few lawyers had set up a booth stacked with small books for any researcher who would take it: legal advice for how to protect yourself from political persecution. “We’re worried about a lot of things,” said Lauren Kurtz, executive director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, adding that some scientists had received legal and even death threats. “We have people in power who’ve used legal bullying in the past,” she added, alluding to Trump’s history of using expensive lawsuits, or at least the threat of them, to attempt to silence critics. “That sort of legal bullying is going to be seen as much easier to do.” A handful of scientists have already been targeted for their week. Dr Michael Mann, currently a professor at Penn State, was sucked into a long-running legal suit when a rightwing activist group sued the University of Virginia, his former employer, to access tens of thousands of his emails. Scientists at the University of Arizona are currently enmeshed in a similar fight, and last year representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, tried to subpoena scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Their argument is basically if you get the emails you’ll get the full meat of research, whereas it’s actually a way for them to take words out of context.” Barack Obama’s White House defended the climate scientists’ research; scientists now fear that the Trump administration will leave them at the mercy of lawmakers and activists with an interest in silencing scientists. In 2014 a court decided in Mann’s favor, agreeing with him that turning over research emails chilled research; discouraged collaboration; and put scientists at a competitive disadvantage. The Arizona case remains unresolved after a victory by a group funded by several energy companies. Scientists have also come to the legal group with fears for their professional future. They could be barred from grants or lose funding and effectively iced out of their own jobs, Kurtz said. “We worry about government suppression, where scientists can’t do the same research, can’t use the words climate change, modify reports to make it seem like it’s not as drastic as it is.” In turn, she said, the team of attorneys has started to research whistleblower cases, “if and when a scientist comes to us for those sorts of quandaries. A couple have stopped by to say, ‘Hey, I am employed by DOE another one by USGS. I was going to retire and now I’m not going to, because I feel like there’s a need for me to be on the front lines and fight back.’” Much of the data from federal agencies is already public, and some scientists have already begun “guerrilla archiving” to back up the climate data on non-government servers. “Who knows what will happen with the Trump administration,” Kurtz said. “They may do all sorts of back-door things. I don’t think the Trump administration is going to be super pro transparency.” After Donald Trump was elected in November, the mayors of more than 60 US cities sent an open letter to the president-elect urging him to work with them on combating climate change. Trump’s team has yet to respond to the letter, said Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a co-founder of the Mayor’s National Climate Action Agenda. Garcetti, who is in DC for the US Conference of mayors, said he is encouraged by the conversations he’s had this week. “Even a change of administration cannot take away our determination and our ability to continue our progress,” Garcetti said. “Through different administrations and different congresses, most of the action has happened at the local level.” Garcetti said he spoke to the president-elect from the C40 Climate Summit in Mexico City last month. Though he wouldn’t elaborate on details of the conversation, Garcetti described Trump as “open-minded” on the call. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he’s hopeful the Trump administration will respond to the economic case for fighting climate change. “This issue goes a lot deeper than Democrats and Republicans,” Walsh said. “This goes into healthcare. … These issues all of sudden are starting to become economic issues.” Extreme storms, wildfires and droughts, sea level rising and storm surges and air pollution are not just concerns for the mayors of big, liberal cities, Garcetti and Walsh stressed. Climate change is “not an ideological issue but an urgent one for us, that transcends partisanship with undeniable science and more importantly undeniable human impacts”. As climate change causes parts of the earth to grow hotter and drier, it has also led to a recent surge in extremely destructive wildfires. It is difficult to link specific events, like the devastating wildfires in Tennessee’s Great Smoky Mountains last year, directly to climate change, but scientists found that a drier and warmer planet can increase the likelihood of wildfires. “If you get conditions that are ripe for a wildfire across multiple places and at multiple times then wildfires will actually happen,” said Auroop Ganguly, an expert on climate extremes and water sustainability in Northeastern University’s department of civil and environmental engineering. But even as regions become more susceptible to wildfires, there still has to be a trigger, like arson, to start the blaze. Ganguly compared this to a person’s general health: if someone’s all-around health is bad, he explained, that person is more susceptible to other illnesses. That person will also have a more difficult time fighting back against a sickness. Similarly, hotter and drier parts of the globe are more susceptible to wildfires and have a more difficult time responding to it. And scientists say the planet could become more vulnerable to wildfires. Fire season was longer for more than a quarter of the Earth’s surface from 1973 to 2013, according to a July 2015 study published in Nature. The study also found that climatic changes are expected to increase fire season severity in the coming decades. So far, Donald Trump has said extremely little about how he would lead Nasa, whose administrator reports directly to the president, or the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, whose officials report to the secretary of commerce. Late in the campaign, Trump said he hoped to “free Nasa” from its logistics work in low-Earth orbit (which Nasa does little of) and instead “refocus its mission on space exploration”. “Did you ever see what’s going on with space, with Russia and different places? And us? We’re, like, we’re like watching. Isn’t that nice? So much is learned from that, too.” The main suggestion of Trump’s speech, alongside his repeated denial and skepticism toward the science of global warming, is that he intends to cut Nasa’s Earth science work. Bob Walker, an adviser to the president-elect, has pushed the idea of cutting all of Nasa’s climate research in favor of deep space exploration. Climate scientists have warned this would prove a savage blow to research efforts. Trump’s nominee for secretary of commerce is billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who has not commented at all about how he would lead Noaa, protect US fisheries or guide climate science. Ross made his fortune, in part, by rehabilitating steel and coal companies. Trump has not said who he would name Noaa’s administrator; Obama’s first pick for the post was marine ecologist Jane Lubchenco. The current administrator of Nasa, former astronaut Charles Bolden, is expected to follow tradition for appointees when a new president takes the White House, and submit his resignation shortly after Trump is inaugurated. Though Nasa has generally enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, it has a $2bn Earth science program that many scientists fear will suffer greatly under a Republican government stocked with many climate change skeptics and deniers. The space agency’s planetary science programs may go untouched, but scientists also fear that funding will stagnate as Congress enacts new tax cuts and grapples with how to reconcile those with hugely expensive efforts to repeal healthcare reform and spend on infrastructure. Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa’s new associate administrator told reporters last month that he stands by the priorities and data he prepared for the incoming administration. “The principles we drew out are the principles that we would use in any administration,” he said, adding that he urged scientists to “focus on the data that we get and not amplify the noise.” “Behave like scientists, and talk like scientists, passionately,” he continued. “Talk about science in away we know that’s affecting life on earth.” As Ucilia Wang and Jonathan Watts reported earlier, climate change will affect just about every detail of daiy life, from your morning coffee to chocolate to a glass of wine. Later on we’ll hear how this increasing aridity is going to affect your meal – breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. We’re also going to hear about the steps climate scientists can take to defend themselves in the age of Trump Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Renewable energy has long been considered a liberal cause championed by tree huggers on the ground and Democrats in governments. That political divide showed up in election campaign contributions historically as well. But during the 2016 election cycle, the solar and wind trade groups gave more money to Republicans than Democrats running for federal offices for the first time, reported Reuters. Their bets may pay off as they face a new administration with a new president who thinks solar and wind are expensive and sees wind turbines as bird killers that also ruin views of his golf courses. Roughly $400,000 from wind and solar political action committees (Pac) went to dozens of federal election candidates. Among the Republicans are Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Representative Tom Reed of New York and Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, who together received more than 40% of the federal campaign contributions from the Solar Energy Industries Association Pac. That shift in money politics reflects the reality that many red states are home to large solar and wind farms. Take a look at the top 10 states with the most solar energy generation and you will find Arizona, North Carolina and Texas on the list. The top wind energy states include Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa. Lobbying across political lines also makes sense because the country’s energy market is made up of more than 3,000 utilities and regulated mostly by states. Local politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, are particularly keen to support businesses that bring jobs and tax revenues. Encroaching into homes and dinner tables, rich and poor alike, climate change plays no favorites – it will take your chocolate. Cacao trees grow in rainforest climates that will only become drier in the next few decades, depriving the plants of the large amounts of water they need to grow. Research collated by Noaa and the IPCC suggests that climate change will force the best land for growing chocolate into higher altitudes, creating a slew of conflicts for farmers and industries, especially in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, where a huge amount of the world’s cacao is grown. Over the last 40 years, the world’s available land for cocoa growth has declined 40%; the temperature in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire is expected to rise two degrees Celsius over the next 40. Growers in some regions are trying to breed drought-resistant plants to survive the worsening conditions, while others are replanting sections of rainforest to mimic cacao’s natural habitats, in a method called cabruca in Brazil. Coffee will fare even worse than cacao, suffering from the increasing heat as well as the aridity, and beer production, reliant on a large amount of water for processing hops, has already been affected at dozens of breweries. Climate change has already encroached into grocery stores and restaurant menus, as it kills crops and makes it harder to keep fruit, vegetables and livestock alive. Global warming is also draining our drinks, including one of the oldest human libations: wine. A warming climate will affect the quality and yield of the grapes, with mixed results around the world. Rising temperatures could help growers in some regions, for instance helping France in particular grow premium grapes. But the same can’t be said for California, the biggest wine producing state in the country. Rising temperatures, coupled with persistent drought and the likelihood of more extreme hot and wet days ahead, are gradually making the state less habitable for its notable varietals, including chardonnay and cabernet. Grape growers have been taking note of the effect of global warming. How they deal with it will influence the role the US is the global wine industry, where the country is among the top five wine grape growing and wine-producing nations. Some vintners are using technology to help them cope. For example, they are using sensors and drones to monitor soil quality and planting more cover crops to retain moisture in the ground. They are turning to owls and falcons to fight the growing army of pests such as mice and voles. They are also recycling the precious water more, in some cases relying on giant bins of earthworms to do the job. In London, the live panel debate is underway off at Guardian headquarters. A room full of members, readers and activists joins host Mark Rice-Oxley, the actor and entrepreneur, Lily Cole, the author and academic, Dr Jonathan Rowson, and the Green party’s science and technology spokesperson, Esther Obiri-Darko. Also on the panel are the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, Craig Bennett and the “renegade economist” Kate Raworth. Opening the debate, the panel members discussed how to be about the political and economic change necessary to protect the environment. Cole told the audience that the most effective option for individuals was to vote with their wallets. One of the main areas I’ve focused on is how I spend my money. I’m not perfect with it, I’m as guilty as most westerners of buying too much... But, because the world is so driven by economics and so driven by money right now, the only way you’re going to communicate to businesses is by starving their bottom line. Obiri-Darko added that such a change needed a combination of “people power” and government accountability; saying that one or the other alone would not bring it about. She said that, where she knocks on doors in south west London, air pollution was a major concern and only when climate change began to affect people would they start to demand action from their elected officials. Raworth cited Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign as an example of what she characterised as an obsession with growth at the expense of other issues, such as the protection of the environment. Rowson agreed that Trump has an “old-fashioned economic mindset” and his election was unlikely to be helpful to those who sought to fight climate change. But he said, looking at the bigger picture, the election of a US president - possibly only for four years - should not been seen as a catastrophic event, adding that Trump can be influenced because of the extent to which he cares about his esteem. Bennett agreed that there was cause for optimism, arguing that movements have never brought about major societal changes unopposed. It was only when the campaigns to abolish slavery were doing really well that the pro-slavery movement formed. They said ‘this will harm my competitiveness, we can’t possibly afford this, it’s going to cost jobs’. Almost identical arguments to those used now by people campaigning against action on climate change. The cup of coffee that millions of us woke up with this morning was more likely to have come from Brazil than another nation. But this ritual will become rarer and more expensive, according to forecasts that climate change will cut the bean-growing belt by half here and across the world over the next 35 years. Drought and rising average temperatures are already a growing worry for farmers such as Maria Assunção da Silva, whose family has grown coffee in Minas Gerais since the 19th century. The business has rarely been tougher than in the past four years. In 2013, the drought was so severe the beans formed as empty husks. Since then, he says, the weather has been destructively unpredictable. It has been dry in the usual rainy season, which results in smaller beans. In the usual dry season, it rains, which makes it difficult to process the harvest. “What we have been seeing in these past years has been hindering our production,” Silva says. Others have fared worse. In Espirito Santo recently, the worst drought in 80 years forced farmers to dig up thousands of arid robusta coffee trees and switch to alternative crops. Warehouses in the region were down to a quarter of their capacity. Exports of conilon, a variety of robusta, fell 90%. With prospects poor for this year, many warehouses are expected to close. Growers say the weather is becoming more erratic and extreme. São Paulo’s coffee producers suffered dire water shortages in 2015, but when the rains finally came, it was often in intense downpours that led to flood damage. While the main temperature trend is of warming, some crops were hit by frost in freakish cold spells last winter - in the middle of the hottest year ever recorded in the world. “What is certain is that the weather is more unstable and unpredictable,” noted agronomy engineer and coffee farmer, Pedro Ronca. Overall, improved production techniques and well-timed rains for the main arabica crop ensured a good national harvest and a stabilisation of prices. But scientists and environmental groups warn the situation will become more difficult in the years ahead in Brazil and other coffee-producing nations. “Increasing temperatures and extreme weather events will cut the area (in the world) suitable for production by up to 50%, erode coffee quality, and increase coffee prices for consumers,” predicted a Climate Institute study last year. Earlier research by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, suggested none of the current coffee producing regions in Brazil would have the ideal conditions (average temperatures of 18-22C, ample rain and no frost) by 2080. “Once full climate change effects are experienced, Brazil may face challenges to remain a major coffee producing country,” the authors noted. This grim scenario is far from inevitable. As well as global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change, Brazilian officials, scientists and farmers are moving to adapt. Eduardo Assad, of the government’s agriculture research institute Embrapa, believes there is considerable potential to move coffee production to the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. Currently that is not feasible due to frost, but this risk will decline if temperatures rise by 2C. Even so, this would require huge disruption to Brazil’s agriculture, particularly to coffee farmers who usually require 15 to 20 years for a return on their investment. For now, most would rather stay put and use technology and chemicals to cope with rising climate challenges. Silva is investing in a coffee drier because he cannot depend on the sun, more anti-fungicide chemicals because the risks from unseasonal rain have increased, and to counter the rising temperatures he is planting new heat-resistant varieties of coffee and insulating the soil with straw. “We don’t think the weather conditions will improve, so we are trying to adapt to the new climate variation,” he says. Such measures push up his costs and the global value of beans, but, if the forecasts are correct, it is only the start of the rise in price that we will all pay for our morning cup of coffee As Jonathan Watts reported earlier, the end of the world is looking not just warm but dry, from the mountainous lakes of South America up to the disappearing snowpacks of California. Later on we’ll hear how this increasing aridity is going to affect your meal: – breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert.

There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Michael Ingui, an architect at Baxt Ingui Architects, specializes in creating passive houses – “super-insulated houses that use a fraction of the energy” of a traditional home. Passive houses use much less energy than a traditional home due to a by using superior insulation, special triple-glazed windows and an energy recovery ventilator which filters in fresh air and releases stale air. The ventilator is used to heat the house, which means no radiators and no boiler. It also means significantly less energy costs: Ingui estimates his passive houses save “80-90%” on energy bills. “The way I would really describe it is: a passive house is just a better building,” Ingui said. “It can also heat and cool itself passively, without any mechanical elements.” The walls of a passive house are much thickerthan a normal home due to the extra insulation, which Ingui described as forming an “envelope” in which any gaps that may exist in a traditional home are completely sealed. Ingui has designed and fitted out seven in the past four years, and is working on three more. Some of those homes – including the one I looked around in Brooklyn on Thursday – have solar panels on the roof, which means they can effectively be carbon zero. … We have a small favour to ask.

What happens in Antarctica does not stay there: the icy waters off the southernmost continent are an engine for life around the world, and they are warming faster than anywhere else – a threat to the global food supply. For decades, scientists have been diving underneath the quickly melting ice in a race to learn the consequences of warming on the ecosystem. For six years of increasingly withering heat, Californians have rationed resources, fought with celebrities and watched as precious reservoirs and snowpacks, so important to the state’s economy and daily lives of its residents, disappeared to historic lows. When it rained, it was never enough – though hope has partially returned with massive storms of the last three weeks. According to the US Drought Monitor, about 42% of the state is out of drought, thanks to a series of heavy rains around the Bay area and blizzards over part of the Sierra Nevada, where snowpack provides critical water for the state in the spring and summer. The heavy rains also replenished the state’s largest reservoir, Lake Shasta, back to 82%, and even Los Angeles saw flash flood warnings as storms stretched across the state. But southern California has not enjoyed as much of a deluge as the north. Santa Barbara’s Lake Cachuma holds only about 8% of its capacity. New Melones Lake, in central California, holds only about 60% of its historical average, and some residents in the region need bottled water to drink and cook. Jay Lund, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of California Davis, warned that the drought will leave scars that may last decades. The state may have to keep paying for expensive water pumping for years, and in the Central Valley some aquifers “might never recover to pre-drought levels”, he wrote in a blog post. “Drought damage to California’s forests could require decades to recover, or, if higher temperatures persist, the ecology of many forests might shift to new normal condition,” he added. “Native fish also will likely need years to recover – with impediments from already depleted numbers and highly disrupted and altered ecosystems.” Lund said that the state’s leaders need to accept that the drought is not permanent, but that California is “a dry place with permanent water shortages (except in unusual wet years)”. Over on Tumblr, we’ve been running a blog collecting young people’s experiences, hopes and fears on climate change. You can submit your own messages or artwork here. We’ll be highlighting some of the posts throughout the day. The end of the world is dry. That is not a prophesy of doom, but an increasingly evident fact as I learned during a recent trip to Patagonia. I visited in October, revelling in the immensity of the region (which is four times the area of the United Kingdom), zagging back and forth between its Chilean and Argentinian sides, delighting in spectacular mountain and grassland scenery, and taking a dark pleasure in the road signs telling me I was on the “Ruta del Fin del Mundo”, a geographic reference to this southernmost tip of the Americas rather than a reminder of imminent apocalypse. I also spent a lot of time skimming stones across lakes - a childhood pastime given a fresh boost by the incredible scenery, the glasslike surface of tarns in the Torres del Paine, warm weather and the discovery of a slow-mo feature on my cellphone video camera. Much as I enjoyed this activity, it also reminded me of the damage being done by rising temperatures and declining rainfall. Lakes formed by glacier melt were full. Many others had dried up completely, destroying fish habitats and drinking sources for jaguars, guanacos and ema. This wasn’t restricted to Torres del Paine. Five hundred miles further further south, I saw pink flamingos flapping their way across a half empty body of water and, then, another 15 minutes along the road, a fox crossing through the dust of a white alkaline lake bed that had been completely exposed to the wind. Over the course of the weeklong trip, I lost count of the lakes that had evaporated. After I returned home, I did a little research on whether this was merely seasonal or a sign of a longer-term climactic shift. Climate scientists believe the world’s extremities, the poles and mountains ranges, are warming faster than elsewhere, which means Patagonia is particularly vulnerable because both its latitude and altitude are high. Shin Sugiyama, a researcher at the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University, confirmed the region’s glaciers were declining faster than those in other mountain ranges. Andrés Rivera, a Senior Researcher of the Glaciology Laboratory at the Centre for Scientific Studies in Valdivia in Chile, noted how the recent dry period in the region has contributed to rising snow-lines and a loss of lake volumes. Eric Rignot, professor of Earth System Science at the University of California, said the glacier melt and lack of precipitation were likely to have been affected by the ebbing of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), a belt of Antarctic low pressure that normally brings snow and ice to Patagonia. Research from other scientists say SAM is at its weakest ebb in 1,000 years, due in part to to increasing greenhouse gas levels. The consequences are not sudden. Rather they are of steadily increasing severity. Chilean newspapers have reported the worst drought in Patagonia since records began, after seven consecutive years of unusually low snowfall, short winters and hot summers. In Argentina, this is blamed for the deaths of 1.8m sheep, or 12% of the national flock. The earlier stage of this prolonged drought has also left a black mark on the landscape in the form of thousands of charred stumps from the huge forest fire that tore through Torres del Paine In 2011. That was started by careless tourists and spread out of control because trees and brush were unusually dry. Despite it all, Patagonia is still one of the most beautiful places on earth. I would certainly love to go back, explore remote glaciers, marvel at the other worldly skyscapes and, of course, skim more stones. How many lakes, though, will be left? As Lauren Gambino reported earlier, mayors in US cities are making plans to fight climate change themselves if they have to. Later on we’ll also hear how the financial rewards – the money that can be made in renewables – also holds out hope for the future even if our political leaders fail us. We’re also going to hear about how drought is impacting California and Latin America. Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away New York City and the wider state are embracing renewable energy as the state’s leaders take steps to resist Donald Trump’s rollback of green initiatives. The Atelier Condo, a 47-story, 478-unit residential building in Hell’s Kitchen, for instance, installed about 3,000-square-feet of solar panelling in 2011. Daniel Neiditch, president of the Atelier and of real estate company River 2 River Realty, said that after rebates from the city and state, the investment cost $70,000. Nieditch said he earned that much back in savings after a year-and-a-half. He estimates currently provide almost 10% of the building’s energy. “There’s no way you can do solar and not save money over time,” Neiditch said. “It’s a no brainer.” New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city by 80% by 2050 and both local and state incentives can cut the cost of solar panel installation by 50%. Neiditch said some developers don’t realise how quickly they will make their money back, or what kind of rebates are available in their state. “There’s so much more that can be done,” Neiditch said. He said developers “need to be educated” on the benefits – possibly by the city or state. The Atelier will be fitted with another 6,000 sq-ft of solar panels this summer, Neiditch said, which could mean solar accounts for 25% of the buildings electricity, saving $200,000 a year. This morning the Guardian caught up with a couple of big city mayors to discuss their concerns about the incoming administration’s climate change agenda. The takeaway: who needs Washington? Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Boston mayor Marty Walsh said the real change is happening at the local level and federal action, er inaction, won’t change that. “Don’t get in our way,” Garcetti said, describing his message to an administration that is hostile to efforts to curb climate change at the federal level. Trump has threatened to pull out of the international Paris agreement and said he would dismantle Obama’s Clean Power Plan, as well as other initiatives taken by the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has nominated Kansas attorney general Scott Pruitt to head up the EPA, the agency he is currently suing. “We’re prepared, if we withdraw from Paris, to enact Paris at the local level,” Garcetti told a handful of journalists at the Hilton Continental Hotel in Washington. “Worst-case scenario, the federal government can probably take away 20% or 30% of our progress, and I’d rather have 100% than 70% or 80%, but I feel like that 70 to 80% of further progress is inevitable based on the leadership that we’ve already shown.” Much of the international fretting over the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the US presidency is focused on the real estate magnate’s pledge to “cancel” the Paris climate deal. Tearing up a central plank of Barack Obama’s climate legacy by removing America from the agreement would cause shockwaves that could badly damage the global climate effort. But will that actually happen? Currently, every functioning government in the world is signed up the Paris goal of limiting global warming to a 2C increase on pre-industrial times. Chinese president Xi Jingping, in a veiled jab at Trump this week, warned that “we must ensure this endeavor is not derailed.” Similar diplomatic pressure is likely to come from other nations once Trump is in the White House. Quitting the Paris accord would take a three-year notice period. A quicker way would be to exit the UN climate body itself, which would take just a year. Such a move would likely cause other countries to question why they should make the effort to cut emissions if the US, historically the world’s largest emitter, can’t be bothered. The latter option appears unlikely, for now at least. Shortly after his election win, Trump said that he in fact has an “open mind” to the Paris deal. And then Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, played down the prospect of complete US withdrawal last week: I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response. Perhaps the most likely outcome is ostensible US involvement in the UN climate process but with little effort to provide the climate funding or emissions reduction goals demanded by the Paris deal. Whether the Trump administration will be openly disruptive or sullen during talks remains to be seen. “It isn’t clear whether his ‘seat at the table’ will be a good dinner guest or the drunk uncle,” said Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. In partnership with the Guardian, Univision Noticias is highlighting the urgency of climate action around the world. Join Univision and Fusion environmental correspondent Nicolás Ibargüen as he discusses on Facebook Live. We’ve heard from Jonathan Watts how experts in Brazil are anxious at the indigenous territories and fears there around a government move to change how their land is demarcated. We’ll have more on this theme later. 15 things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Shortly we’ll have live video from our partners Univision in Miami. Before that, its worth reflecting that Trump has a home in Florida which he regularly spends time at. Mar-a-Lago mansion began as a cereal heiress’ dream of a presidential retreat on a south Florida beach. The children of its current occupant, President-elect Donald Trump, may live to see the ocean sweep over the tennis courts, up across the long, and up to the mansion’s front door. Whether the next president accepts science or not, climate change is on course to turn his beloved resort into something closer to Atlantis than the winter White House. By 2045, a relatively weak category-two hurricane would bring the ocean up to main building of the resort, a risk consulting firm found last year. Two other Trump properties, in Hollywood and Sunny Isles, could be cut off from roads and even made temporary islands by tidal floods. Just over an hour the south, Miami is already at war with the ocean, as tides floods increasingly sweep floods into the streets and homes, swamping condo lobbies and cutting off islands and bridges. The rate of sea-level rise has tripled over the last 10 years, according to a University of Miami study. City leaders have budgeted $400m to install dozens of water pumps around the city and to raise the height of roads and seawalls, but the state remains divided: real estate developers continue to build expensive condos, and the governor insists on skepticism toward science. The tides, meanwhile, continue to seep up through Florida’s porous limestone ground, threatening to destroy homes and seeping sewage into drinking water. By some researchers’ predictions, parts of south Florida appear already lost, and swaths of the state will be underwater by 2025. 2016 was the warmest year, globally, on record and the second warmest year on record in the US, following the long-term warming trend. As Trump assumes the presidency, there are signs that these numbers are starting to translate into tangible consequences for Americans: There are now Americans displaced due to climate change, from Louisiana to Alaska. Several Alaskan towns are set to be relocated – last year warmer than normal days outnumbered cooler than normal days in the state by a ratio of nine to one. Of the 10 global cities deemed by the World Bank at most risk from sea level rise, five are in the US – New York, Boston, New Orleans, Tampa and Miami. The north-east of the US is warming faster than the global average and the sea level is rising more quickly too. New research, published in Nature, shows that crop harvests in the US are likely to shrink by as much as a half due to rising temperatures. States such as California, already stricken by drought, are likely to face huge “megadroughts” in the future. Last year there were 15 climate-related disasters in the US that cost more than $1bn in damages. A total of 138 lives were lost. The severity of hurricanes and floods is likely to increase in parts of the US. There has been a four-fold increase in the number of large, lengthy forest fires in the American west over the past 30 years. While Trump may be unconcerned over the impact of climate change, the period of his presidency is likely to involve further signs that Americans are at risk. In response, Trump has so far promised to gut climate and clean energy spending, withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal and attempt to kickstart the ailing coal industry. Public realization of scientists’ warnings has been illustrated by the latest polling by Yale University. In November, Yale found that one in five Americans are “very worried” about climate change – the highest proportion yet recorded. 4) Where are the public on this issue? Is there is an ideological dividing line as in the US, or is there a broad consensus about the science? In 2015, 28% of Brazilian municipalities entered into emergency or calamity due to extreme weather – droughts, floods, storms, landslides. This affected millions of people so that are aware things are changing. We don’t face the same debate as the US about whether climate change is related to human activities. Last year, the Paris climate treaty was ratified easily despite our political crisis. Even the most conservative members on the political spectrum, the debate is more about what we do about climate change. Some say Brazil has already made the biggest contribution through deforestation reduction and renewables, which account for a little more than 70% of electricity generation and 40% of the total energy mix. The question is whether to do more. But unfortunately, climate change is not a priority for this government, as it wasn’t for the previous one. It is seen as an environmental issue, not a development issue. 5) What does this mean in concrete terms? The past two years have seen a 60% rise in deforestation. Considering what is going on now in congress, we could see a new era of deforestation in Brazil. It is very alarming. We could be returning to the bad days of more than 10,000 square km of clearance each year. 6) How might climate policy be affected by the 2018 presidential election? I don’t think Brazil can elect someone like Trump who denies climate change, but we could have someone with very conservative ideas who sees the environment as an obstacle for development. They might argue that if US is doing nothing on climate, why should we? But one of the candidates will be former environment minister Marina Silva, who will ensure that sustainable development and climate policy are part of the debate. It’s too early though to say who might win. We don’t know who will run and what will be the impact of the ongoing corruption investigation (intro bribery at the state oil firm Petrobras). But the result will be important. The next president is the one who will have to deliver results because after 2020 Brazil’s commitments become obligations. 7) Given the current trends, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future? I’m not too gloomy, but Brazil is a country of lost opportunities. Every year, there are more groups who see forests and the environment as obstacles to development. But there are good signs too. There is room in the private sector for discussing climate change as an opportunity for Brazil to benefit from our natural capital. We need a more efficient agriculture and more renewable energy – biofuels, bio energy, wind, solar and hydro. Why not make the most of these competitive advantages? The economic benefits of climate action are huge. We are trying to make this a priority for the next president. But it won’t be easy. If the world is to get emissions under control, Brazil will be a key player. Over the past decade, it has played a mostly positive role, both in taking domestic action to reduce the rate of deforestation of the Amazon, and also in constructive diplomacy in international climate talks. But economic recession and political turmoil have led many to fear this might change in the future. For an insight into what might come next, I approached Carlos Rittl, associate researcher of the Brazilian Climate Observator, an umbrella organisation that represents more than 40 environment NGOs. Here’s our Q&amp;A: 1) Yesterday, the Brazilian justice ministry changed the rules for demarcating indigenous land. What is your take on this? This is really, really bad. It is the most negative change made in environmental and climate policy since the government of (Michel) Temer took power last year. Indigenous territories are critical for Brazil’s climate resilience. This new move threatens even already demarcated lands, yet the justice ministry moved ahead without any public debate, any discussion with the people affected. It shows what a myopic view the new government has when it comes to land use. 2) How else has climate policy changed since the switch of government from the centre-left administration of Dilma Rousseff to the centre-right administration of Michel Temer? In terms of Brazil’s goals, there has been no change. But there has been a shift in attitude that could affect whether those targets are achieved. There are many proposals that are bad for the climate. The administration wants to soften environmental legislation and reduce protected areas. Before Temer came to power, he outlined his approach in a document called Bridge to the Future. It contained no reference to climate or renewables. The only reference to the environment was a promise to weaken the environmental licensing process. 3) One of the reasons for the political shift has been the rise of the agribusiness and evangelical lobbies in congress. What are their goals when it comes to climate policy? There is a danger that Brazil’s climate policy could shift backwards. Agribusiness presents itself as the solution to current economic crisis. They say they need more investment and more support and changes to land policy. The decision made by the ministry of justice yesterday is connected to that. They also want to prevent agribusinesses from having to do annual environmental licensing renewals. They want approval for mining in indigenous territories and protected areas. They are also pushing for more infrastructure to make their business easier. For example on the Tapajos river, they don’t just want more dams, but also waterways so soy can be shipped from central Brazil to Europe. All this will make it more difficult for Brazil to deliver on its 2020 climate goals. They are also trying to remove the environment minister from his post because he is trying to do his job. Over the next few hours we’ll also be hearing from our Latin American correspondent, Jonathan Watts. First up he’s been speaking to a key expert in Brazil, a key country. Later we’ll hear about his trip to Patagonia, and how climate change is affecting something a lot of people hold dear: coffee. Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is the outgoing chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant under investigation for possibly defrauding investors about what it knew and did about climate change. Shortly after Barack Obama’s election in 2009, Tillerson announced his support for a carbon tax – if only because he considers it preferable to cap and trade policies – but environmental groups have denounced Tillerson’s nomination. Tillerson does not deny that climate change is real, but in a hearing with Congress last week refused to answer a question about whether ExxonMobil had tried to sow doubt about the science. Tillerson told Senator Tim Kaine, “I’m in no position to speak” for his company’s executives, until the frustrated congressman asked, “Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or are you refusing to do so?” “A little of both,” Tillerson answered. Tillerson also rejected the Pentagon’s warning that climate change is a national security risk and would only say the US will “keep a seat at the table” in the international effort to curb global warming. Trump has previously promised to quit the Paris climate deal. As we’ve pointed out in the previous post, Obama’s legacy is far from perfect. But it’s fair to say there are greater fears around the Trump administration’s key cabinet posts relating to climate change. Alan Yuhas is about to post on the pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Also ahead we’ll have more video from New York’s rooftops. Highlights: 15 things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Barack Obama has banned drilling in the Arctic, fought to reduce pollution and power plant emissions, and preserved more marine territory than any previous president. Yet researchers at Columbia University say that his legacy is tarnished by the work of the US Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that has handed out nearly $34bn of taxpayer-funded loans to corporations and foreign governments for fossil-fuel projects. The team at Columbia collaborated with the Guardian last year on a report that showed how Obama’s the obscure agency within his own administration quietly spoiled his record by helping fund a steady outpouring of new overseas fossil fuel emissions – effectively erasing gains expected from his headline clean power plan or fuel efficiency standards. Since January 2009, the US Export-Import Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of low-interest loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad. Here’s a video we made about Obama’s climate change legacy. As Rick Perry’s rather polite confirmation hearing rolls on, it’s worth recalling the more combative hearing faced by Scott Pruitt yesterday. Pruitt is Trump’s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA was founded by a Republican administration with a mission to keep America’s water clean, its air free of toxic pollution, and help towns around the country keep their fields, roads and rivers safe. Pruitt has used his post as Oklahoma’s attorney general to sue the EPA 14 times in seven years, 13 in alliances with energy, agriculture and other large corporations. Pruitt, 48, is the first pick for EPA administrator opposed by the Environmental Defense Fund since Richard Nixon founded the federal agency in 1970, and has received more than $300,000 in campaign donations from executives at poultry and oil corporations. Other environmental groups have called Pruitt a “puppet” of oil and gas companies, noting that in 2014 he fought regulations with a letter written by Devon Energy. In another case unearthed by the New York Times, Pruitt stopped a legal fight between towns and poultry companies whose tons of chicken manure were poisoning water in north-eastern Oklahoma. If confirmed, Pruitt will likely try to dismantle Barack Obama’s work on climate change, with the Clean Power Plan his most obvious target. The plan is currently on hold in the courts, due to a suit brought by 27 Republican-led states to stop it. Pruitt has also doubted the evidence of climate change in general, claiming in May that – although 2016 proved to break yet more records for temperature and sea ice, and that nearly all scientists agree the world is warming dangerously – the “debate is far from settled”. In his home state of Oklahoma, where Pruitt has fought to keep hydraulic fracking as unregulated as possible, scientists have linked fracking to an extraordinary increase in earthquakes. Oklahomans are now as likely to feel an earthquake as Californians. One of the themes we are looking at is how the impact of climate change does not affect everyone equally. On Comment, we’ve just launched a piece from Elizabeth C Yeampierre, the executive director of Uprose, an organization that fights for environmental justice. She writes: “When things are bad for everyone, they are particularly bad for people of color. The Trump administration is about to legitimize injustice in all of our communities. People of color have endured the extraction of our land and labor – and its legacy – since the creation of these United States. Now, we are bracing ourselves for worse things to come.” Read the full comment piece here Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is currently facing questions from US senators in his confirmation hearing as Donald Trump’s secretary of energy. Perry rather sheepishly told the senators that he regrets calling for the department of energy to be scrapped. Famously, Perry ran for president in 2012 only to call for the abolition of three government departments in a televised debate. The problem was he couldn’t remember the name of the third agency – energy – leading him to flounder briefly and then mutter “oops”. Maria Cantwell, a Democratic senator on the energy committee, couldn’t resist: “I suspect now, having a chance to learn about the importance of this department, you have a very different opinion.” Perry conceded he may have been a little hasty. “After being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination,” he told the committee. The Department of Energy maintains America’s nuclear arsenal, cleans up nuclear waste and undertakes research in a number of areas, including climate change. The Trump transition team raised alarm by sending out a questionnaire that asked for names of scientists who have worked on climate research. Perry said he didn’t approve of the request and promised the committee that he wouldn’t target climate scientists or eviscerate their work. Perry did confirm, however, he supports Trump’s “America first” energy strategy (which means lots of drilling for oil and gas) and it doesn’t sound like he will be bending the president’s ear over the urgency of global warming. He told the committee: I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by manmade activity. The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy, or American jobs. This sort of equivocation has become familiar during these confirmation hearings. Both Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and Scott Pruitt, his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency, have said they accept the climate is changing but have voiced doubts over the extent of human culpability for this. Scientists, on the other hand, are pretty clear on this point – the world is warming due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. We’ve picked up the climate blog in the US, and have heard from outgoing EPA boss Gina McCarthy who says staff there are nervous about the incoming administration’s attitude to science and climate change. We’ve also published the first of our three videos from solar panel clad buildings in New York City. Coming up later we also have a live video from our partners Univision who are blogging live in Spanish today on climate change. At around 1pm ET (6pm GMT) we’ll host a live video report from them in Miami on the climate change threat. Miami is just one of the places on the US coast already being impacted by rising sea levels. Highlights of our blog so far include: 15 things you can do to make a difference George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Brooklyn Navy Yard, a huge industrial park located across the water from Manhattan in New York City, installed a 3,152 solar panel field on top of one of its buildings in September. The yard, which is home to 300 businesses with 7,000 employees, expects to generate 1.1m kilowatt hours of energy each year – which it says is the equivalent of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.4m pounds and saving 76,000 gallons of gasoline each year. The panels cover an area bigger than a football field on the top of a warehouse close to the East river, overlooking downtown Manhattan. “Sustainability has long been a core corporate value of ours,” said Clare Newman, chief of staff and executive vice-president of the Brooklyn Navy Yard corporation. “And our tenants and our businesses really care about and embody the same values.” The project was paid for by Con Ed solutions, a subsidiary of the larger Con Ed energy company. Con Ed solutions secured $625,863.83 in incentives from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which promotes energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. We’re looking at all of the issues around climate change – including the solutions. And both New York City – and the wider state – are among the trailblazers in the US when it comes to solar power. In New York City there are thousands of buildings which have been fitted with solar panels. During the US hours of our climate change blog, we’ll have three videos for you from Adam Gabbatt, who we sent to the top of skyscrapers and other buildings in the city to find out how they make that work. One of the big areas of concern around the incoming Trump administration is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We’ve published a story earlier Thursday on an interview with the agency’s outgoing administrator, Gina McCarthy. She told me that there is “nervousness” among EPA staff that Trump’s incoming administration will sideline science and reverse action on climate change. McCarthy told the Guardian that the Trump administration would face resistance from multiple fronts if it ran counter to a widespread shift to renewable energy, as well as scientific opinion, by rejecting climate science and attempting to bolster the fossil fuel industry. Trump has promised to reduce the EPA to “tidbits” and has nominated the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to run the agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times over its pollution regulations, has questioned established climate science and has been criticized by environment groups for his ties to oil and gas interests. “People at the EPA will be respectful of the new administration but they will continue to do their jobs,” said McCarthy, who was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 to head the regulator. “I would not be telling the truth if I said there was no sense of nervousness. There is a sense of nervousness that the new administration will take decisions not in line with the science. Read more of the interview with McCarthy here. Hello and welcome to the American portion of our climate blog, on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration. Oliver Milman in New York and Alan Yuhas in San Francisco will see you through. The new president will forever be reminded of his tweet that claimed that global warming “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. But that conspiracy theory was expounded four years ago now and Trump’s attitude to climate change, like much else, has wobbled in the wind. Where once climate science was apparently just an excuse for a “very, very expensive form of tax”, Trump conceded in November there may in fact be “some connectivity” between human activity and warming. On the campaign trail Trump promised to “cancel” the Paris climate deal but now Rex Tillerson, his choice for secretary of state, insists that the US will still have a “seat at the table” in climate talks. Climate change may be the defining challenge of our time, but the response of the world’s superpower remains clouded in doubt just a day before its new president takes power. Trump has been consistent, however, in his steadfast support for fossil fuels, even donning a miner’s helmet during a rally in West Virginia to promise – in the face of economic reality – that coal mining jobs will return. Environmental groups fear the worst – emissions reduction plans trashed, climate funding scrapped, scientists harassed or muzzled and a vacuum of international leadership that may encourage other countries to ease off their own efforts. Trump’s cabinet picks will be key and the signs are ominous. Incredibly, Tillerson, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant that actively suppressed its own knowledge of climate change for decades, may be the one most in line with mainstream science. Trump’s nominations for the Environmental Protection Agency and the department of interior, to name just two, have raised doubts over whether humans really are influencing the climate and have been showered in donations from polluters. We will look at each of these cabinet picks, as well as outline some of the key climate issues facing the Trump presidency. The next four years could well see havoc from severe storms, rising seas, scorching heatwaves and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Pertinently for Trump, these calamities could just as likely occur in the US as some far-flung country. Even his own resort at Mar-a-Lago in Florida could be at risk. A response beyond blaming the Chinese will be required. So that’s about it from this part of the world. We are off for a lie down in a dark room. Stay tuned though for much, much more from the Americas, hosted by Oliver Milman and Alan Yuhas. For anyone just tuning in, highlights of this blog so far today include: 15 things you can do to make a difference George Monbiot – ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away I leave you with this: A quick interruption with some breaking news: Scotland has just unveiled some of the world’s most ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions, aiming at a reduction of 66% within 15 years. It’s not quite Norway (which is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030), but it’s a laudable aim, reports our Scotland editor Severin Carrell, who has all the detail here. Hoesung Lee: ‘Climate change is a global problem, so individuals should encourage their governments to take action’ Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is up next, talking to Juliette. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? We are continuing to emit greenhouse gases and if unabated this will cause further warming and changes to the climate system. This increases the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Substantial and sustained reduction in emissions are needed to limit climate change.” What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Individuals can do many things, depending on their local and personal circumstances. One example is improving energy efficiency. Ultimately [though] tackling climate change is a global problem, so individuals should encourage their governments to take action. What is your message to President Donald Trump? I’d like to congratulate Mr Trump on his forthcoming inauguration as President of the United States. We look forward to continuing to work with the new administration, and with American scientists and institutions, on improving our understanding of climate change and how to tackle its impacts and risks, as we have done for nearly 30 years, since the inception of the IPCC.” Mark Campanale: Fossil fuel investors ‘will be left holding the baby whilst the world has moved on’ Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative thinktank and who conceived the idea that many fossil fuel reserves will be unburnable if the world beats climate change, talks to Damian now: What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? There is no doubt now that we’re in the middle of a major technological revolution in the transportation and power sectors. Electrification of the transport fleet and the rise of cheap solar isn’t going to be reversed, actually it will accelerate. The real question right now is whether technological leaps and cost reductions in renewables can accelerate adoption rates fast enough. The scale of the challenge is enormous – not helped by new investments in fossil fuels exceeding tens of trillions of dollars over the next few decades. For that reason, we may not be seeing the reductions in fossil fuel power generation capacity that we need. Instead of investors looking at fossil fuel companies as ‘ex growth’ stocks, they are too many that take a ‘business as usual’ growth approach to their investment. Time will tell, but our expectation is that investors [anticipating ‘business as usual’ growth from fossil fuel stocks] will be left holding the baby whilst the world has moved on. The real risk is that the precious years we’ve got to make the difference we need to the future will have been tied up trying to defend the past. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If you’re interested in quality, high paying and skilled jobs for the American middle classes, then renewable energy has to absolutely be the place to look. It’s a sector with more employees now than in the US coal industry and with a long way to grow. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Switch to a clean energy supplier like Good Energy, or maybe a community utility and project developer like Mongoose Energy. May Boeve: ‘The climate movement is more important than ever’ May Boeve, head of climate campaign group 350.org, is next up: What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? I think we’ve entered into a new chapter in the climate fight. Renewables have become cheap and widespread enough to represent a real threat to the fossil fuel industry, so they’re beginning to fight back. If we can make it beyond the political barriers coming up worldwide and elect governments who take climate change seriously, we have all the technology we need to make rapid progress and succeed in keeping global warming as close to 1.5C as possible. But it’s going to be a real fight. The work of the climate movement is more important than ever. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Organize. We can’t solve climate change alone. Get together with people and change your community, your country, and the world. What is your message to President Donald Trump? Quit. But if you have to stick around, realise that the clean energy economy is the greatest, biggest job creator in history. Ed Davey: ‘To fight Isis and make America great again, invest in solar’ Former climate secretary and Liberal Democrat MP now talks to Juliette Jowit What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The Paris agreement surpassed my expectations about what’s possible - although it’s still not enough, given where we are. We have had president Obama’s leadership, Xi Jinping’s (China’s) leadership, and president Modi’s (India’s) leadership. Then we had technological break-throughs, particularly solar.” What is your message to President Donald Trump? To fight Isis and make America great again, invest in solar. Where does Isis’ power come from? They are funded by oil and gas, particularly oil.” It would be wrong to think that Donald Trump’s views on climate change reflect those of the American people. While the incoming president is dismissive of the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is real, serious and driven by human activity, the US population is not. A survey in November for the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 70% of Americans think climate change is real, and just over half, 55%, believe humans are mostly to blame. The figures are encouraging. But they make clear that the US public, like those in other countries, lags far behind the scientific opinion. The fact is that many people still don’t accept that climate change is driven by human activities, and that it is serious enough to warrant action. In the Guardian’s Science Weekly podcast today, we explore why climate change risks can be hard for us to take on board. Debika Shome at the TCC Group co-authored a report for Columbia University on the psychology of climate change communication. She explains how the perception that global warming is a problem for people who live far away and far in the future, combines with scientific jargon and the inherent uncertainty around climate predictions to make climate change messages an exceptionally tough sell. But here, another field of science can help. Understand human psychology better, and the messages can be made to hit home, she says. During the US presidential re-election campaign in 2012, Matthew McGregor, now at Precision Strategies in New York, ran Barack Obama’s digital rapid response team. Matthew is not an expert on climate change, but he does know how to mobilise people to take action. We asked him how he would make people care more about climate change. Facts, he says, are not enough. Also lending advice is Tima Bansal, professor of sustainability at Ivey Business School in Ontario. The climate change problem cannot be solved without help - and sometimes radical changes in behaviour - from businesses, large and small. But with little incentive to change their ways, what can we as consumers do to force corporations to act in the world’s best interests? As Bansal explains, it could be easier than you think. Ben van Beurden: ‘We don’t have to sacrifice economic growth’ Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell plc, now: It’s good news for all of us that [the Paris climate agreement] came into force. The scenarios that we and others have done clearly show that a future of net-zero emissions is technically feasible near the end of the century. And not only can the world achieve it technically, but it also makes economic sense in a societal way. In other words, we don’t have to sacrifice economic growth. That’s the good part. The remaining challenge is: can it be done commercially? Economically is about the way society can bear it, commercially is about how to make sure the main actors – consumers and companies – can, and will, do the right thing. And if society, through government, doesn’t ensure it makes commercial sense to move to a net-zero emissions energy system, nobody will make the next step. The good thing is that the Paris agreement raised the bar for everyone. Everybody feels the obligation to act. So in that sense I’m actually very optimistic. The nature of the challenge of climate change is that it will require unprecedented levels of co-operation between government, industry and society. What often tends to happen in our industry is that you have either isolated advocacy, or people have a very adversarial approach: I’m for, you’re against. In the end this doesn’t resolve anything. It just creates noise for policymakers. We have to move beyond that and start real collective planning for how we are going to achieve the kind of energy transition the world needs. Craig Bennett: This is ‘decade zero’ Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, talks to Damian ... What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The climate impacts of global temperature rises of just 1C have already triggered melting ice-caps, unleashed killer storms and droughts, bleached the world’s coral reefs, choked our cities with pollution and displaced people from their homes. The case for urgent action is now universally accepted by governments, scientists, business and ordinary citizens around the world. Whilst trillions of dollars are being invested in the renewable energy sector and building a low carbon economy, this is still too little and too slow. This is ‘decade zero’: The decisions we make now on meeting our energy needs, producing our food and protecting our forests will determine if we can keep temperature rises well below 2C and prevent catastrophic climate change. We’re sitting in the last chance saloon but governments still seem unable to break their addiction to dirty energy – unless people power can make them. What is your message to President Donald Trump? Renewable energy and the low carbon economy is the world’s greatest job creator. Be smart, and lead from the front. Clean energy, owned by American citizens, acting in the interests of American citizens will not only make ‘America Great Again’, it will save lives and protect your nation too. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Be part of the movement to ‘keep fossil fuels in the ground’. It’s as simple as that. Divest your money from banks that fund it, switch energy suppliers to green energy, support communities saying no to fracking, demand our politicians act now before it’s too late. And join an environmental organisation like Friends of the Earth. Professor Dame Julia King: ‘Trump needs to build an economy for 2050, not 1950’ Prof Dame Julia King, an eminent engineer and one of the UK government’s official advisers at the Committee on Climate Change is next up, talking to Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? To have a good chance of keeping global temperature rise to below 2C the world will need to reverse the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero within the next 50 years or so. This involves switching to clean forms of electricity, transport, cooling and heating, and finding ways to avoid – or mop up – emissions from industry, agriculture, shipping and air travel. We are not currently on track to achieve this, but global momentum is building quickly. What is encouraging is that many companies, cities and citizens are now taking a leading role, alongside pledges and action from governments around the world. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950! What is the best action concerned citizens can take? The Committee on Climate Change recently looked at how to reduce UK emissions over the next 15 years. We found that some of the best things people can do to reduce their household-level carbon footprint are: Save money, by making your home energy efficient, and making choices on food and travel that lower costs and emissions. Take advantage of new technologies – if you drive, switch to a fully electric vehicle and look at a smart home energy system. Make your voice heard, by, for example, continuing to talk to your local politician and others to urge them to act, find out what companies your pension fund invests in and write to the trustees to encourage them to switch to ‘low carbon’ investments. Michael Liebreich: ‘Wind and solar now the cheapest new power sources in much of the world’ Now it’s Michael Liebreich, founder of analyst firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance and who has advised the UN and World Economic Forum on energy, speaking to Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The past decade gives us enormous cause for optimism. Relentless growth in global CO2 emissions has been brought to a halt much earlier than anyone thought possible. Wind and solar power have become the cheapest new power sources in much of the world; natural gas is outcompeting carbon-intensive coal; LEDs and other energy efficiency solutions are being installed at scale; and electric vehicles are starting to fly out of showrooms. But it’s not enough to stabilise emissions: to stay within a 2C carbon budget we have to see emissions cut dramatically and quickly, which remains a staggering challenge. The Paris agreement set out ambitious long-term aspirations, but its near-term commitments don’t add up to much. In particular, if Asian countries build all the coal-fired power stations currently in their plans, then kiss goodbye to the 2C warming target. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America Great Again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Focus on a few big things. If you are renovating, insist on lots of insulation, good windows, a good boiler and efficient appliances. You can cut your fuel bills by 75% – I know because I’ve done it. If you live in a city, get rid of your car: join a car club, walk or cycle more, use cabs and public transport. Again, I know because I haven’t owned a car in London for 22 years. And don’t fly short-haul, use trains – you’ll get there quicker too. John Schellnhuber: ‘We are now at a watershed in history’ Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and who has advised Angela Merkel, the Pope and the EU, now speaks to Damian Carrington. We are now at a watershed in history I think, because the traditional industrialised countries – US, UK, parts of Europe, Australia – are now more or less giving up being pioneers for climate action and it is emerging economies [like China and India] that are doing the bold steps. The world is upside down really. The old developed world has more or less lost faith in saving the planet and it is the new economies who seem to take the lead. This is the hope we have. Politicians can’t do it on their own. The political process is so slow and dysfunctional almost everywhere. There are two factors that can accelerate our transition to sustainability. One is clearly technological progress, which is often much faster than anybody expects. The other is civil society, you have to put pressure on your politicians. You have to raise the moral bar much higher. You have ask them ‘do we want to save this planet for our descendents or not? On the actions concerned individuals can take, Schellnhuber said three things stick out: Try to avoid using airplanes. Whenever you do a carbon balance sheet, you see flying is just the worst thing you can do regarding your carbon footprint and often it is more convenient to take a train these days. Second is to reduce your meat consumption, if you eat any, and that is also good for your health. The third one is follow the money: the fossil fuel divestment movement. Tell your bank manager you would like your money be invested into renewables instead of coal, oil and gas industry. At least become a pain in the neck. What companies fear like hell is loss of reputation, as that can break even the big companies’ necks. Nicholas Stern: ‘Destruction of the environment would reverse economic growth’ Leading climate change economist Lord Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, has also spoken to Damian Carrington for this blog. Stern said global action on climate change has made substantial progress, with the Paris agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals creating a global agenda for the first time since the end of the second world war. It was agreed by everybody and applies to everybody. That is extremely important and quite extraordinary when you think how difficult it is to put together a global agenda with 196 countries. But he said it was openly acknowledged that the Paris deal leaves a big gap between the current plans and what is needed to avoid 2C of global warming - the danger limit agreed by the world’s nations. The next very big question is how do we ramp up those ambitions. China, the biggest emitter, is ahead of the game. It said it would peak [its carbon emissions] by 2030, but my guess is it will peak not very long after 2020. That is the key example. I have been working in China for 30 years and the change over the last six to seven is quite remarkable. India is starting to get much more committed too. So if you look at the two countries with the biggest populations, you do see changes. But the US and Europe will matter greatly to this. It is very important Europe raises its game. Stern said Donald Trump needs to back the green economy to take advantage of the growing global demand for clean energy, which is being driven by the worldwide commitment to tackling global warming. If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth. Stern said concerned individuals should put pressure on governments and businesses: Demand explicitly and directly strong action from the politicians, particularly in cities where we know action can be extremely rapid. Do your shopping at firms that are responsible. It does need political, business and civil society push. The reason is that the urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood. We will double the world economy in the next 20 years or so. If we build this new world economy anything like the old one, then we are not going to get down to the [emissions] we have to be. There has to be radical change. Professor James Hansen Director of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, and ‘father of climate change awareness’ spoke to the Guardian after winning the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? “The global temperature has increased since 1970 at about 0.18C per decade, and it’s going to continue at approximately that rate, because the climate change is driven by environmental imbalance: there’s more energy going in from the sun than out into space, because of the climate change gases. “The climate impacts are extremely detrimental, and the worst one is seal level rise, because of the ice sheets going unstable, [and] the economic and humanitarian cost of that is devastating.” What is the best action concerned citizens can take? “The single most important thing [individuals] can do is to join Citizens Climate lobby: they [and] other organisations advocate a simple rising carbon fee. People that join are asked to write letters to the editor, op eds [comments in newspapers], write to representatives, legislators, and they do it in a respectful way. What is your message to President Donald Trump? “If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would: improving the situation of the common man, the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.” Photographs of the melting Greenland ice sheet by Timo Lieber are a beautiful but chilling reminder of the impact of climate change. All photographs use three colours. Each represents a symbolic value: pristine white is the ice sheet, blue is water and black is dirt. These colours form the chromatic point of view and are the clue to reading them. Beyond this simplicity, the pictures are scientific documents that reveal and link the two global phenomenons: global warming and atmospheric pollution. “The images are deliberately abstract.” says Timo Lieber in an interview by Tim Walker. “I didn’t want them to be documentary photographs. You have to get close to find the small, hidden details that help you to understand what you’re seeing. They’re beautiful, but what you’re looking at is climate change at its worst. My favourite is the one that looks like an eye. It’s a half-circle of concentric blues at the top of the image – it’s almost as if global warming is looking right back at you.” UN climate chief: ‘There is a lot all of us can do to bend the curve towards the world we want and need’ Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - the UN’s climate chief – today gives her views on climate change to our head of environment Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? There are very positive actions and signals from all areas of society post-Paris [climate agreement] including from governments and cities to business, investors and citizens. But the reality is also that greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere continue to rise and thus national and international ambition needs to rise even more. The world needs to peak global emissions urgently and trigger a steady but significant de-carbonisation of the global economy so that year on year and decade on decade the total achievement is in line with the science. We are on the way towards a better, climate-secure world, but it will be a long journey and only a sense of urgency will get us to the ‘well below 2C target’. What is your message to President Donald Trump? I look forward to working with your new administration to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere in this very special world. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? There is a lot all of us can do to bend the curve towards the world we want and need. Get informed and get involved. Be a conscious-consumer for example: there is wealth of information on the environmental footprint of goods and services. Think about how you travel, and try to choose a lower emissions form of transport while offsetting those emissions you cannot avoid right now. 2017 is the UN’s International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development – take time to do so research on the sustainability of your holiday and leisure activities. If you are lucky enough to have a pension or investments, find out how your money is being used – is it supporting environmentally-sustainable companies or not. Get more involved in your community and city — actively argue and support public transport policies; renewable energy; energy efficient initiatives and ones to back forests; wetlands and other nature-based ‘infrastructure’. Thanks Damian. I hope that hour answered lots of your questions. If not, keep them coming. New York will take over from us within the next hour, and our US environment correspondent Oliver Milman will be at the helm. Here’s another fact for you: Coming up: what are the best books and films about climate change? What animals are most at risk from climate change right now? Plus: a word with the experts, unfashionable as they may be in some quarters these days. We’ve spoken to a plethora of leading figures climate change debate and found a surprising amount of consensus about what needs to happen next to our climate. Last question I’m afraid, but it’s a good one, from ‏@takvera. Low. Although you are right that those ice caps are very vulnerable to global warming, it takes a long time to melt such big chunks of ice. But in coming centuries, the risk is very real. The last time the Earth had CO2 levels as high as this, sea level was many metres above what it is today. That would wipe out many of the world’s biggest cities. ‏@OisinMoriarty asks about electric car takeup. A long way is the truth, but the takeup is accelerating very fast. There were about 2m electric cars on the world’s roads at the end of 2016. That’s just 1% of the market in Europe and China. But as cheaper models with longer ranges arrive and cities crack down on air pollution, more and more will take to the roads. On Twitter, ‏@FourTwoThreeOne asks: Right here, right now is the answer. Scorching heatwaves are already five times more likely thanks to global warming and it’s not going to get better until carbon emissions start to fall. You can read more here. MercuryBen asks a political question. Why is it that climate change scepticism is so popular with those on the right-wing? I’d suggest two reasons. First is that tackling global warming requires communal action, which for those libertarians far to the right looks just like communism. Communism is evil, therefore climate change can’t exist. The second reason is that the fossil fuel lobby gives far more money to rightwing politicians, as they are seen to be more “pro-business” than those on the left. But as the Tory politician John Gummer, now Lord Deben, argues today: “Conservatives cannot properly be climate deniers. At the heart of their political stance is a desire to hand on something better to the future than they have received from the past.” ID5865653 asks an important question about whether aviation can be made greener. Does anyone know what, if any, progress is being made on making flights more carbon neutral? I know there was a successful round-the-world solar flight in 2016, but that doesn’t seem likely to bear fruit commercially any time time soon. Are the fuel requirements just too large for electric planes etc to be practical? Flying does have a heavy carbon footprint – about 1 tonne for every economy passenger from London to New York and back. But I don’t think electric planes – like Solar Impulse – will ever carry many passengers. Batteries are just too heavy and solar panels need too much area. More likely is the adoption of a sustainable biofuel for jets, perhaps from algae, jatropha or even tobacco. But progress has been slow. For freight at least, air ships are a possible future alternative. For now, using a good carbon offset scheme is the only solution. The livestock industry causes about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and CordTrousers asks: Any suggestions other than vegetarianism? Meat does have a heavy carbon (and methane) footprint, but not all meat is equal. Beef has by far the biggest footprint, so cutting out that alone makes a big difference. Reducing meat consumption, rather than going vegetarian, is also an option backed by many, dubbed climatarian or reducatarian. As it happens, lots of people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy, so cutting back would help lengthen many lives. Also, lots of new companies are starting to produce vegetable-based substitutes for meat and dairy products, aiming to make them as tasty, healthy and affordable as the originals. PeppermintSeal wants to know what the impact of ocean acidification might be. Much of the world’s CO2 emissions end up being absorbed by the oceans, which become more acidic as a result. Regarding the increased acidity in the oceans, what follows from this? More coastal erosion and threat to sea life I’m guessing, but are there other things happening? Does acidity affect salt levels? Ocean acidification is real but research is still ongoing. This is from a UK research programme: “Already ocean pH has decreased by about 30% and if we continue emitting CO2 at the same rate by 2100 ocean acidity will increase by about 150%, a rate that has not been experienced for at least 400,000 years. Such a monumental alteration in basic ocean chemistry is likely to have wide implications for ocean life, especially for those organisms that require calcium carbonate to build shells or skeletons.” I think acidification is unlikely to affect salinity or coastal erosion. But rising sea levels and fiercer storms will affect coastlines. Lots of commenters, for example greensocialist147, are arguing that overpopulation is the fundamental problem. The world’s population is set to rise to 9 or 10 billion by 2050, which definitely makes beating climate change tougher. But the critical thing is the size of their carbon footprints. If they all cause the same emissions as today’s Americans or Australians, we are doomed to catastrophic climate change. But if, as is difficult but possible, emissions from energy, transport and buildings are reduced to very low levels, then a large global population can live sustainably on the planet. In terms of curbing population growth, poverty reduction, education for girls and availability of contraception for those who want it are vital. Crucial question next from yourcomment. Is it compulsory for every article on global warming to feature a photo of a polar bear? Why? Well, no. But they are beautiful animals and the Arctic is warming far faster than the rest of the planet. But the research here suggests, among many things, that images of real people are effective ways to communicate the significance of climate change, too. Reader rokealy wants to know how climate change will affect the UK and Europe. This is such an important matter and delighted that you are covering this in such an excellent way. Really educational yet at the same time quite unsettling. With the rise in temperatures, and various reports coming to conclusions that Europe will get warmer or colder, can you give a clearer picture of what we (Ireland, UK, Europe) can expect to see in our climate in the near future? The short answer is: more extremes. With more heat in the atmosphere, there’s more energy to drive more extreme events, such as storms. In the UK, the main consequences are more severe flooding and more deadly heatwaves, which the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, say are high risks already. Summers are likely to get drier and hotter overall and winters warmer and wetter. But there will also be extreme cold snaps, probably driven by the fast-melting ice in the Arctic. Next up is a question from Clare Rudkin, on whether global warming can be blamed for specific events. I would like to know the percent of increase in likelihood of events that seem to be linked to climate change. Weather has a lot of natural variability, but climate changes increases the chances of many types of extreme weather – loading the dice, if you like. Scientists are getting better and faster at calculating how much the probability of heatwaves etc occurring are increased by global warming. In some cases, it’s a lot. Warm sea temperatures linked to severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef were made at least 175 times more likely, the extreme Russian heatwave of 2010 was made three times more likely, major floods in Paris in 2016 were made almost twice as likely. Hi! I’m Damian Carrington, head of environment at the Guardian, and I’ll be tackling your climate questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please post anything you’d like to ask in the comments below or tweet me @dpcarrington. Here’s the first one, from Sandie Elsom. Congratulations on deciding to focus on this most important of all issues. I’d like to see clear explanations of what the science is saying and just how serious the outcomes will be. I have difficulty convincing family members that climate change is a clear and present danger. These webpages by Nasa are very good: clear and striking. You could also take a look at the assessment of the world’s scientists produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It concludes that global warming is set to inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly. The assessment involved thousands of scientists – probably the biggest scientific review in human history – and was approved by 196 nations, making it as definitive as it gets. Journalism often tends to focus on the problems, and as such can often give a glum view of the world. But during this hour we’ve heard from: The Egyptian hydroponics farmer trying to beat the drought the team at the Thames Barrier in London, the kind of tech that might be needed elsewhere in the world the British Antarctic Survey, keeping tabs on climate change at the bottom of the earth some of the innovators offering 21st-century ideas to fix a 21st-century problem Soon we’re going to hand over to Damian Carrington, our head of environment, to answer your questions. But before we go, can I make a personal plea for you to consider joining us as a member? Journalism is a costly business, as I’m sure you can appreciate from the work that has gone into this product. But we do it because we believe things like this can make a difference, can help build the movement to roll back climate change. If everyone reading this blog gave just a small amount, we would be on a far firmer footing to keep producing work like this. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. Many thanks everyone. Here’s the hourly Twitter card: When it comes to green tech, the electricity sector has seen the biggest focus so far, with the cost of solar, wind, LED lighting and batteries plummeting in the last decade. The cost of conventional nuclear power has not, but so-called “small modular reactors” (SMR) are now attracting a lot of attention: smaller, cheaper and mass produced is the promise. An SMR design was recently submitted to regulators in the US, but Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, is not holding his breath. “I do laugh when people talk about SMRs being five years around the corner. The licensing conditions for nuclear – quite correctly – imply a very slow development process because you can’t mess around with it.” The great hope for nuclear for decades has been nuclear fusion, which carries the prospect of cleaner and limitless energy. However, even those building the biggest fusion experiment in the world – ITER in France – acknowledge that commercial nuclear fusion will not come before 2050, by which time global emissions will already have to be near zero. Much faster to deliver will be smart grids, which apply data and communication software to make far more efficient use of existing electricity, creating in effect “virtual power stations”. These, along with storage of intermittent renewable energy, are the most important technologies, say experts, allowing countries to move to 100% renewable energy on the grid. Big batteries are already replacing power plants in California. A breakthrough in battery chemistry to deliver cheaper, more powerful devices is being sought around the world but they are not the only way to store energy – a plant in the UK is already using air compressed into a liquid. New renewable technologies are also being investigated. Researchers are seeking breakthroughs in solar energy, a truly global energy source, aiming to make panels that capture even more of the sun by, for example, using perovskite crystals instead of silicon. I’ve been looking at all kinds of technology that promises to help us battle climate change in the decades to come. Of course, renewables have been a quiet success story over the past 20 years – but this is only half the picture. From solar air ships to lab-grown meat, algae jet fuel to nuclear fusion, technology innovations around the world hold the hope of slashing carbon emissions and giving a big boost to the battle against global warming. Mission Innovation, a collaboration involving 50 of the world’s biggest nations, is set to invest $30bn a year by 2020 on clean technology, and the UK’s special representative for climate change, Sir David King, played a leading role in its creation. One of his favourites is a huge new airship being developed by a British company, VariaLift, to provide low-carbon freight transport. The plan is to cover the airships with photovoltaics, then rise them to 50,000 feet where there is very little air resistance. Solar energy can then power the electrical engines and the airship could reach speeds of 340km/h. Also attracting attention is a German idea to store energy in regions without mountains, where pumped-water storage cannot be used. Heindl Energy’s solution is to raise a giant column of rock using the pumped water, which is then allowed to fall again when the energy is needed. The allure of new technology is strong, not only to speed up cuts in emissions, but also because of the colossal market it represents, offering good jobs and economic growth. The International Energy Agency estimates that $44tn will be invested in energy by 2040, with an ever bigger slice going to clean technologies. Of course, science is a vital part of our understanding of climate change, and down at the bottom of the earth, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are conducting a range of experiments and observations to keep tabs on any changes in conditions. The BAS collaborated with us to get exclusive video back from the Antarctic, and my colleague Irene Baqué put together this short package to show what’s going on. While flood defences are often criticised and the government is regularly accused of failing to account sufficiently for how much climate change is making it worse, the UK’s Thames barrier has been a real, unsung success story. Built in eight years, its six gates have never failed to protect London. In the early hours of last Saturday morning, Steve East made a judgment call to protect Londoners from the Thames. Faced with tidal and weather forecasts and other data, the engineering manager of the Thames Barrier decided to raise it for the second occasion in 2017 and the 178th time since it was finished in 1982. The result was a 3.3 metre differential – the height of the water level on the downstream side, which leads out to the North Sea, above the upstream side of central and west London, which the huge structure protects. “It’s an art, not a science because we are making decisions on forecasts,” he tells me, as we overlook the barrier where the rotating gates are raised in times of need. East started working as an administrator at the barrier 31 years ago. Over that he time, he’s not seen a linear line showing the barrier being closed more frequently, but a more jagged line with spikes in individual years. For example, in one recent year the barrier was closed on 50 occasions in just a three month period. Before that it had gone about two years without a closure. “It’s an easy decision to close it. The hard decision is not to close it,” he says. While closure protects Londoners and property from flooding, it also stops river traffic, wildlife such as seals, and puts a “strain on the asset”, as East puts it, wearing the barrier out. The barrier should last until about 2070. Climate change means a 20-90cm sea level rise in the Thames by 2100, according to the Met Office and Defra, and East is clear: “There’s an acknowledgment that sea level rise will require a new barrier.” Planning is just beginning on what location and size that barrier might take, but the project is anticipated to cost £10bn. Some of that money will go on raising and strengthening the tidal walls downstream of the barrier, and making space for water downstream to overflow into during tidal surges, such as car parks and playgrounds. East thinks that when the barrier starts having 50 closures a year regularly – at the moment the average is four annually – that’s when a new barrier will be needed. But for now – even with the two closures in less than a month this year – “we’re a long way from that”. Across the Middle East and north Africa, global warming means record temperatures, which in the summer can make life unbearable from Tehran to Tripoli. The knock-on impact on farming in the region has been severe – indeed some people have even blamed the Arab spring partly on the way climate change has depleted agriculture. But some enterprising farmers are finding ways to beat the drought, like this Egyptian extolling the virtues of hydroponic farming – that uses more than 95% less water by not planting in soil. A final three tips on positive individual action here from Chris Goodall: • For a decade, investors ignored the movement that advocated the divestment of holdings in fossil fuel companies. Large fuel companies and electricity generation businesses were able to raise the many billions of new finance they needed. Now, by contrast, money managers are increasingly wary of backing the investment plans of oil companies and switching to renewable projects. And universities and activist investors around the world are selling their holdings in fossil fuels, making it more difficult for these companies to raise new money. Vocal support for those backing out of oil, gas and coal helps keep up the pressure. • Politicians tend to do what their electorates want. The last major UK government survey showed that 82% of people supported the use of solar power, with only 4% opposed. A similar survey in the US showed an even larger percentage in favour. The levels of support for onshore wind aren’t much lower, either in the US or the UK. We need to actively communicate these high levels of approval to our representatives and point out that fossil fuel use is far less politically popular. • Buy gas and electricity from retailers who sell renewable power. This helps grow their businesses and improves their ability to provide cost-competitive fuels to us. Renewable natural gas is just coming on to the market in reasonable quantities in many countries and fossil-free electricity is widely available. Think about switching to a supplier that is working to provide 100% clean energy. Chris’s 15 things you can do to help stop manmade climate change is published in full here. Have we really been going five hours? We’re just getting warmed up. No pun intended. If you’re waking up in America, stay tuned: our New York office will be taking over this running article in a couple of hours, with the focus switching to the inauguration tomorrow. In the past hour, we’ve really only had time to skim the surface of some of the good things going on in this time zone: the Afghan hero trying to reforest an entire province the Israelis who turn salt water into drinkable stuff – and export the technology around the world the Swedes building a carbon sink in Stockholm Please do post your questions for our head of environment, Damian Carrington, to answer, or you can email him on damian.carrington@theguardian.com. He’ll be with us at 1pm GMT. And here’s another fact for you: Right then. We’ve not nearly finished with good news so we’re going to carry on past the hour with more inspiring people and technology, starting with the Egyptian farmer beating the drought with smart water-saving kit. This month sees the launch in Stockholm of the world’s first urban carbon sink. The project will trap carbon from garden waste and store it in the ground, thereby compensating for the emissions of around 700 cars. The idea is based on turning wood and other organic waste into “biochar”, produced like charcoal by heating it in the absence of oxygen. The first firings will make use of thousands of discarded Christmas trees. In the shadow of a large conventional power station in the southern suburbs, the new carbon sink will produce 300 tonnes of biochar a year, which will then be used to fertilise the city’s parks and green spaces. In turn, heat generated during the process will be used to heat local apartments. Simon Rea, of of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which is sponsoring the project, told me: This is the world’s first urban carbon sink. We want other cities to be inspired by Stockholm and start their own biochar production. Combatting “climate apathy” in this way is seen as an important aspect of the project, which wants to involve Stockholmers and make them feel that they themselves have a role to play in influencing the climate. The project organisers say that three more cities and a US federal state have already shown an interest: Melbourne in Australia, Mysore in India, Parma in Italy, and the state of California. Mattias Gustafsson of Stockholm Water, told me: It is just the beginning. This natural carbon sink will not save the world but we must begin to pay off our carbon debts. Israel has long experience of dealing with some of the pressing demands of climate change. Inside the high pressure hall at the world’s largest water desalination plant on the Israeli coast near Rishon Lezion, a forest of pressure vessels is humming with the sound of sea water being made drinkable at the equivalent of 65 atmospheres. The plant, completed just three years ago, is at the cutting edge of a desalination technology being exported around the world from China to India, to California and Australia, promising new sources of water in a warming world. The success of the Sorek plant and others like it in Israel – built by Israel Desalination Engineering [IDE] – is a testament to recent leaps made in desalination technology. One hundred years ago the British in Mandatory Palestine predicted that water would be an issue for a growing population, a challenge that has obsessed Israeli politicians over the decades. Today, Israel is a net exporter of water and its desalination plants provide almost 65% of the country’s potable and industrial water. Advances in reverse osmosis water purification technology have made it possible to build plants large and small, and increasingly environmentally friendly, allowing the production of drinkable water wherever there is access to the sea. The process is fast and relatively cheap. In the space of the Guardian’s visit to the plant, sea water extracted from the Mediterranean was cleaned once by being passed through large filtration tanks, cleaned a second time, then filtered in the high pressure hall before having traces of boron removed in a cascade and then treated to soften the water and make it drinkable. Udi Tirosh, of IDE, told me: There has long been an interest here in water recovery. Water shortages are a world issue. California has suffered six years of successive droughts. We are working on a new plant north of San Diego as well as a facility in Tienjiang south of Beijing in China which also has water shortage issues – a thermal extraction plant in this case. In India we are working on a plant for an industrial concern. Terry Macalister, formerly the Guardian’s energy editor and now on the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series steering committee, has just sent this blog post in to us: Terry writes: Global carbon emissions could be cut by one third within 12 months if affluent westerners changed their way of life, according at least to one leading climate change scientist. Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the UK’s Manchester University, says a major reduction in personal air travel is a key starting point. More than half of the Co2 pollution which causes global warming comes from the 10% best-off people on the planet, he argues. “Let’s be clear about this. If the top 10 high emitters – people like you and me and others – if we reduce our carbon footprint just to the level of the average European it would be a one-third cut in global emissions. “I genuinely think we could achieve it in one year but we would have to think that climate change is a very serious issue and that has big political implications.” Anderson, who already avoids flying where he can, made his comments in the run up to a talk he will give on 9 March at Cambridge University. This is part of a new town and gown initiative, the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series, designed to rekindle more debate on global warming. Anderson is convinced that wealthy westerners must act decisively and radically to change their lifestyles. “Those of us who are high emitters … need to rapidly curtail how often we fly. We should not be flying on any occasion business class or first class because that has far higher emissions. We need to find alternatives to flying. “But in addition, we need to make sure that we are not living in larger houses and have many houses, and drive larger cars. “Our high incomes allow us to have status in society and typically have larger carbon footprints. It is a real challenge for us in that position because we have to significantly change in the short-term our lives and find other ways of seeing value for hard work.” Anderson plans to use his talk to explain what kind of personal, societal and corporate changes need to be made in Britain to meet the UK government’s commitment under the Paris climate change agreement. Afghanistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change – but some people are trying to make a difference. An estimated 80% of Afghanistan’s natural resources have been destroyed over four decades of conflict, Ahmad Seyer, director of the Rural Green Environmental Organisation (RGEO) and one of the few Afghan charities working to mitigate the effects of climate change, has told me. Seyer, a civil engineer by training, worked to protect the environment since the mid-1990s, during the Taliban regime, when he worked with international agencies. But it was not until three years ago that he really became aware of the problems associated with climate change. Since then, climate change has been an integral part of the environment awareness training his organisation provides to mosques and schools. In most villages where I go, they actually understand. Climate change is visible to them now. There is not enough snow, and not enough rain. RGEO works across 90 villages in Badakhshan in Afghanistan’s remote northeast to protect biodiversity. Only three percent of Afghanistan’s surface is covered by forests. Loggers and people in need of wood to burn during winter threaten what is left. RGEO has reforested 200,000 trees to help absorb greenhouse gases and provide protection for communities during flash floods, which hit Badakhshan almost every year. Last year, following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake, a flood destroyed over 800 homes in the province. However, while a more sustainable environment would help boost livelihoods in the long term, for many families, economic concerns, compounded by war and unemployment, are more immediate. Farmers have had to sell livestock to survive. Many migrate to Iran to work as day labourers, and some choose to join the insurgency, Seyer said. “Compared to previous years, people have become so poor,” he said. In 2015, RGEO received the UN’s Equator Prize, which has helped boost funding for his organisation. It now runs on about $100,000 over the next couple of years, about half of which is provided by the United Nations Development Program. Faced with the task of convincing fellow Afghans, living in dire conditions, to care about the environment, Seyer said he was dismayed to see the incoming American president scoff at climate change. “This is not a joke. Please fight against climate change,” he said, addressing Donald Trump. “NGOs can’t do this alone. Hundreds of people can’t do it; thousands of people can’t do it. Everybody needs to come together.” Back to more positive actions that individuals can take. For obvious reasons most of these tips (again from Chris Goodall) focus on what wealthier citizens (which includes most westerners) can do. Here are three: • The CO2 impact of goods and services is often strikingly different from what you’d expect. Mike Berners-Lee’s book How Bad Are Bananas? takes an entertaining and well-informed look at what really matters. Bananas, for example, are fine because they are shipped by sea. But organic asparagus flown in from Peru is much more of a problem. • Invest in your own sources of renewable energy. Putting solar panels on the roof still usually makes financial sense, even after most countries have ceased to subsidise installation. Or buy shares in new cooperatively owned wind, solar or hydroelectric plants that are looking for finance. The financial returns won’t be huge – perhaps 5% a year in the UK, for example – but the income is far better than leaving your money in a bank. • Buy from companies that support the switch to a low-carbon future. An increasing number of businesses are committed to 100% renewable energy. Unilever, the global consumer goods business, says its operations will be better than carbon-neutral by 2030. Those of us concerned about climate change should buy from businesses acting most aggressively to reduce their climate impact. Over the next hour we’re going to try to focus on the positive. We’ll look more at what we can all do as individuals, and at inspirational work both locally and internationally to combat manmade climate change. It’s really easy to feel despairing and overwhelmed about climate change. Personally I found this piece by Chris Goodall today to be both inspiring and cheering. He writes about how he used to believe that only massive government subsidies would make clean energy a success, which basically meant it would be a failure. Now he admits he was “completely wrong” about that, and argues that the end of the fossil-fuel era is already in sight: In fact, optimism about successfully tackling climate change has never been more justified, because 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. The full article is here. So Europe might not be on the frontline of climate change but it’s already feeling the depradations of flooding, drought, and rising sea levels. Over the past hour we’ve reported on: •In Italy, questions as to whether climate change might transform wine making. •Insurers reporting a sharp increase in weather-related payouts. •And we are still trying to draw climate change. Finally, another fact for you: Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ Of course, different parts of Europe face different challenges. In Spain, Sam Jones reports that some forecasters believe that southern Spain will be reduced to desert by 2100 if the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked. Researchers looked at the consequences for vegetation in the Mediterranean basin under a variety of possible temperature rises. In the worst case scenario – which would see global temperatures rising by nearly 5C by the end of the century – deserts would expand northwards across southern Spain and Sicily, and deciduous forests would be replaced by Mediterranean vegetation. Roughly a third of Spain would find itself as arid by then as the Tabernas desert in Almería is today. As one ecologist has pointed out, a rise of nearly 5C would be “like bringing Casablanca to Madrid”. This warming has implications for the Alps too. The Guardian’s Stephanie Kirchgaessner, says that in the Italian resort of Obereggen, sometimes it has not been cold enough to give the town much time to crank up its snow production. Resident Thomas Ondertoller told her: Last year we had one week to make the snow. We use a lot of water, and a lot of technical expertise, to make as much snow as possible, because usually after that there is a warm period. For the passionate skier, the product is perfect. For the romantic skier, something is missing,” he says. Further north, it is the sea, not the snow that is the problem, Jennifer Rankin reports from Belgium. Authorities in Flanders, guardians of Belgium’s 73km strip of coastline, are spending €8m (£6.9m) to investigate whether they can build an island to keep the rising tide at bay. The newest bit of Belgium would be off the coast of Knokke, the genteel resort best known for its picturesque dunes and posh golf course. Under an early plan, the island would be 40 hectares big, but could be made 10 times larger over time. Across the border, the Dutch have built the world’s biggest storm barrier, near Rotterdam. The Maeslant barrier – two enormous steel gates almost as long as the Eiffel tower – is designed to protect the port city and the rest of southern Holland from a once in a 10,000-year storm. Peter Persoon, an engineer-turned-tour guide, said: What we tell the people here in the Netherlands is, if the country is flooded the damage will be at least €700bn. If you instead spend every year one billion euros, you spread the bill over 700 years. That is, I think, the Dutch way.” For years, the biggest problem facing vineyard owners in Tuscany’s Chianti region has been the prevalence of scavaging wild boars in the area, a relatively modern phenomenon in the ancient winemaking region. But the threat of climate change could soon eclipse the havoc that has been wrought by the swine, according to a local climatologist who said changes in temperature are already having an effect on wine production in Italy. Giampiero Maracchi, a professor at the University of Florence and expert in sustainability and agriculture, says rising temperatures have already increased the amount of sugar in wines from the north to the south of Italy, though the change might not yet be noticeable. “For the time being, there has been no real negative effect on quality. For the future, it is yet to be seen,” he said. There has been another change related to climate that is sure to have a bigger impact: harvests in Chianti are now happening earlier than in the past. The harvest period used to be around 1 October, he said, but now it is happening between 1-15 September, often because of heatwaves. These are occurring with greater frequency and intensity in the summer months, leading to a faster maturation of the grapes. It means that in the future, in a decade to three decades from now, grapes in the Chianti region may require irrigation, which is not required now. “If we look to the models, with the projected increases in temperature, there will be a water shortage and probably in the future – 10 or 20 or 30 years – we should require some irrigation for grapes. It means we should have some reservoirs of water,” he said. Maracchi said the issue is not necessarily at the top of farmers’ minds, though it should be. “You know, up until the time comes that they can see some effect from the economic point of view, they are not concerned,” he said. “They should be, in my opinion, because climate change is a general problem and we [will] have a lot of trouble.” It is not just an Italian phenomenon. In its 2016 global wine output estimate, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine last year said it expected global wine production to drop by about 5% due to “climatic events”, causing steep drops in production in Chile and Argentina. While the group did not point a finger of blame at climate change specifically, it suggested that global warming, coupled with natural climate variability, were causing a profound change in the wine business, and had made 2016 one of the worst wine production periods in the past two decades. The other issue that looms for Europe is that of climate refugees. War and persecution have forced more people to flee their homes than at any time since records began. But droughts, flooding and storms are also having a catastrophic effect. Almost 60 million people around the world fled their homes in 2014 due to conflict, according to the UN agency for refugees. In the same year, 19.3 million were forced to move because of natural disasters, a study by the Norwegian Refugee Council concluded. Only a small number came to Europe. The majority fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa go to neighbouring countries or regions; most victims of extreme weather live in Asia. Nevertheless, European Union policymakers, struggling to cope with large numbers of recently-arrived migrants, are aware that climate refugees could be on their doorstep. This week the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, told the Guardian: Europe is also surrounded by regions that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and we can definitely not afford to ignore the links between climate change and migration. He is careful about drawing links between climate change and migration, saying that climate change can multiply instability, conflict and state fragility, prompting people to leave their homes. Statistics are difficult to pin down, partly because of the role environmental degradation plays in fuelling conflict. Scientists have said a devastating drought in Syria between 2006-2010 – and the weak response of Bashar al-Assad’s government – was a contributory factor to the ongoing conflict. British economist, Nicholas Stern, has estimated that up to 200 million people could be displaced by climate change by 2050. But not all will end up in safer places. People leaving desertified villages can move to towns lying on a flood-plain. Some will not afford to be able to move: natural disasters that impoverish communities make it harder for people to start again somewhere else. This means climate change is also likely to put more pressure on the EU’s humanitarian aid budget, worth €1.27bn (£1.1bn) in 2014. Stylianides says the EU is spending more on reducing the risk of disasters. But only 13% of EU aid is spent on prevention, while the demand for urgent humanitarian help is growing. The Guardian has published a leader article on Trump and climate change today. It makes the point that while Trump may be able to wreak a lot of damage on the climate front, it’s not all going to be up to him: There’s no doubt the world will lose out if America decides to relinquish global leadership on battling climate change. But Mr Trump’s fossil fuel plans are likely to flounder without higher hydrocarbon prices. No one will frack for gas unless profits can be made. Coal mines won’t reopen while shale gas is cheap. Instead, self-interest will undergird the fight against global warming. China will decarbonise to ensure its citizens don’t choke to death in its cities. The costs of clean energy are tumbling too, keeping nations on the path towards decarbonisation. The price of electric vehicles is dropping; offshore wind power has become dramatically cheaper. For the first time, the costs of wind and solar power have dropped to match those of fossil fuels. Last year was the first in which renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s biggest source of power-generating capacity. Countries such as India have ambitious plans for renewable energy. You can read the full leader here. More on Europe in a minute, including Belgian flood defences, poor snow at ski resorts (boo hoo) and the grave threat to Chianti ... But first something completely different. We’re going over to Facebook live to watch people draw climate change. You may laugh. This might not work. You may get a better view of what’s going on by going here. If global warming has a canary in the mine, perhaps it’s the insurance industry. After all, they are the people who have to pay out when extreme weather events hit. And in Europe, they’ve been paying out more and more in recent years, as an extraordinary succession of flooding and storms sweep the continent. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, have shown me data indicating that the number of devastating floods requiring big payouts has more than doubled since 1980. The firm’s latest data shows there were 30 flood events requiring insurance payouts in Europe last year – up from just 12 in 1980. Globally, 2016 saw 384 flood disasters, compared with 58 in 1980, although the greater proportional increase probably reflects poorer flood protections and lower building standards in the developing world. Munich Re’s Ernst Rauch told me: In Europe, we’ve seen a steep increase in flood events related to severe convective [thunder] storms. The frequency of flash floods has increased much more than river floods since 1980. Here’s the full article. Now then, something a bit different. Yesterday, the world’s leading temperature authorities announced that yes, 2016 was the hottest year on record, and that the world was on average 1.1C warmer than in pre-industrial times. The idea of rising temperatures can be hard to visualise. So why not sit back and listen to it instead: So the UK is by no means immune to climate change, and in the next hour, we’ll discover that that goes for Europe too. Do keep your comments coming – there’s a really vibrant debate going on below the line. If you would prefer a Spanish version, have a look at what our partners Univision are doing here. And if you fancy contributing something more artistic or visual, then Tumblr is the place to go. Finally, our fact of the hour, on the hour, every hour. Well, five minutes late – sorry about that. The UK’s attempts to cut its CO2 emissions are in real danger of being undermined unless ministers tackle the continuing erosion of peatlands, which store several billion tonnes of carbon, Scottish environment campaigners have warned. Recent studies estimate that damaged peatlands – most frequently found in upland areas, already release about 16m tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year through erosion, burning for grouse shooting and overgrazing. Scientists expect that to worsen dramatically as rising temperatures dry out peatland in rain-starved areas, and extreme weather events increase, without concerted effort to protect and conserve them. That in turn will increase flash flooding of lowland towns and villages. Scientists estimate that Scottish peatlands, which cover about a quarter of Scotland’s landmass, lock up about 1.7 gigatonnes of CO2. Jonny Hughes, chief executive of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and chair of the UK’s International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) peatlands project said: Peatlands are just not in good enough health to withstand the effects of climate change in the coming decades. Watching peatland landscapes washed away due to climate change sounds like a dystopian nightmare. Yet climate modelling predicts it to be a very real threat, leading to the loss of millions of tonnes of carbon and the destruction of an entire living ecosystem.” Here are three more tips on individual action you can take to help, courtesy of Chris Goodall: LEDs (light-emitting diodes) have become cheap and effective. If you have any energy-guzzling halogen lights in your house – many people have them in kitchens and bathrooms – it makes good financial and carbon sense to replace as many as possible with their LED equivalents. They should last at least 10 years, meaning you avoid the hassle of buying new halogen bulbs every few months. Not only will your CO2 footprint fall, but because LEDs are so efficient, you will also help reduce the need for national grids to turn on the most expensive and polluting power stations at peak demand times on winter evenings. Frequent use of a tumble dryer will add to your energy bill to an extent that may surprise you. But when buying a new appliance, don’t assume you will benefit financially from buying the one with the lowest level of energy consumption. There’s often a surprising premium to really efficient fridges or washing machines. Consume less. Simply buying less stuff is a good route to lower emissions. A new woollen man’s suit may have a carbon impact equivalent to your home’s electricity use for a month. A single T-shirt may have caused emissions equal to two or three days’ typical power consumption. Buying fewer and better things has an important role to play. Turning our attention to the UK, climate change is already affecting parts of Britain, principally by increasing the risk of extreme flooding and heatwaves, and on Wednesday the government accepted almost all of the current and future risks set out by its official advisors, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The CCC’s report, published in July, concluded the UK was poorly prepared for global warming and set out six priority risk areas. The first two were rated as high risk now, with more action needed. Flooding already causes £1bn of damage every year on average but the risks will rise yet further as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger. The number of households at significant risk of flooding will more than double to 1.9m by 2050, if the global temperature rises by 4C. The deadly heatwave of 2003, which peaked at 38.5C in the UK, will be a normal summer by the 2040s, leading to heat-related deaths more than tripling. There are currently no policies to ensure homes, schools, hospitals and offices remain tolerable in high heat. Severe water shortages are expected as summers get drier and, by the 2050s, will extend across the UK. If temperatures are driven up significantly, many places in the UK will have a demand for water 2.5 times greater than that available. Climate change is likely to drive food prices up, with extreme weather leading to lost crops and price shocks. About 40% of UK food is imported, making the UK vulnerable to droughts and floods driven by climate change around the world. The proportion of prime farmland is expected to fall from 38% to 9% with significant warming, and crop growing in eastern England and Scotland could be ended by degraded soil and water shortages. Warming seas are pushing key species northwards, which may affect the entire marine food chain. New dangers may invade the UK as the climate gets warmer and requires urgent research. “The impacts are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants,” the report states. “Higher temperatures will lead to an increased risk of the Asian tiger mosquito, the vector of Chikungunya virus, dengue fever and Zika virus. The current risk remains low, but may increase in the future.” The CCC also warned that climate-stoked wars and migration around the world could have very significant consequences for the UK, through disrupted trade and more military intervention overseas. On Wednesday, environment minister Lord Gardiner said Our changing climate is one of the most serious environmental challenges that we face as a nation and that is why we are taking action, from improving flood defences across the country to securing our critical food and water supplies. Professor Hugh Montgomery, at University College London added: Acting on climate change can also boost people’s health. If we get it right, our efforts to tackle climate change avoid some of these risks, and directly benefit health: renewable power doesn’t generate health-damaging pollutants, for example, while walking or cycling improves health.” And with that in mind, here come some more tips: We’ve had some great comments below the line this morning. If you have any questions for our head of environment, Damian Carrington, please post them there. We’ll hold an answer session at 1pm. Herewith some intriguing comments. Stefana Broadbent wonders about a “spiral of silence” caused by people fearing to speak out: Another Guardian commenter discusses the importance of finding common ground, regardless of wider political stances: And this commenter wonders about personal responsibility. And finally LordInsect asked for a graphic on carbon emissions. I’m happy to say we have two: And this: Before we move on to Europe and the UK, this is a neat piece of work from my colleague Nick Evershed, the Guardian’s head of data and interactives in Australia. It shows how much carbon we are emitting right now – and how much we have “left to burn” if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. Nick’s calculated that in just the 24 hour lifespan of this blog, the world will pump out more than 112m tons. Hard to visualise? Well let’s let the doomsday clock do the work: So in summary, we’ve been focussed on Africa over the past hour: rising sea levels in Alexandria disappearing glaciers in Mt Kenya an insurgency partially caused by climate change in west Africa and hungry people in the south And here’s another fact for our post-truth world: Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ In South Africa meanwhile, an interesting distinction: while you might find plenty of climate change denial in western countries or oil powers, or even in the White House (from tomorrow), it’s not a common feature of local conversation here. Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, told me: In South Africa, there has been very little of the climate denialist narrative you still see in the US and elsewhere. The South African government has been vocal in its commitment to the fight against climate change for many years, and there is a genuine popular understanding of the problem and consequences of climate change. One reason for that is that ordinary people can already see the effects of climate change very clearly. The devastating drought that has plagued South Africa for the past two years, with ruinous knock-on effects on the rural economy and food prices, is a very real and tangible reminder of our vulnerability to climate change. We really are at the coalface of climate change, so to speak. I’ve been talking to Johannes Wedenig, country representative for Unicef in Malawi about the situation there. He says climate change is making the weather hotter and more variable. From 2000 to 2009 droughts effected 8.5 million people in Malawi, and floods affected 1.2 million. From 2010 to 2016 we have already reached 8.4 million people affected by drought and 875,000 by flooding. So we will see at least a third more over the decade if the trend continues. But I’ve seen from my own experience that it’s the variability of weather phenomena that poses the greatest challenges to farmers in Malawi, especially when combined with an already fragile situation. People are selling their last assets and so are going into the next cycle even poorer, and unpredictability makes it very hard to plan and adapt. Wedenig says these changes affect the poor disproportionately. I’ve travelled widely in Africa but when I got here last year I was really shocked by the amount of acutely malnourished children. You wouldn’t necessarily expect to see such a severe impact here but Malawi shows the impact of climate change compounded by other factors such as soil degradation, population pressure and an over-reliance on a single crop (food source) as a result of past policy decisions. My colleague John Vidal was in Malawi at the end of last year, and wrote movingly about the food shortages there. Here is his piece. In east Africa, concerns are growing that the continent’s second highest peak, Mt Kenya, could be totally ice free within decades. The United Nations Environmental Programme estimates that 80% of East Africa’s glaciers have been lost since 1900. Mt Kenya has lost 92% of its glacial clover over the last century. Scientists are divided over the precise causes of the steady retreat of the glaciers but many blame rising temperatures driven by climate change. The consequences have been dire for locals. Glacial melt is one of the contributors to river flow in the region and many rivers have been drying up in recent years. Seven million people depend on agriculture fed by the vital Mt Kenya water catchment area, which provides the bulk of the tea and coffee exports that are critical to Kenya’s economy. The area also hosts heavily visited national parks and reserves. Although Africa has made a negligible contribution to the greenhouse emissions that cause climate change, many parts of the continent are expected to bear a great burden from the results of climate change. Mathenge wa Iregi, who as a Gikuyu elder has spent many years offering prayers in the forests of Mt Kenya, says he does not need scientists to point out the dramatic changes upending people’s lives and considers the stance of climate-change skeptics like US president-elect Donald Trump baffling. You just need to open your eyes. Mt Kenya was once a striking and impressive site and we even named it in reference to the glacial cover. Everything has changed within our lifetime. And that is simply because we human beings do not respect nature. Guardian columnist George Monbiot is writing today on Trump and climate change. This is his stark take on things: Understandably, commentators have been seeking glimpses of light in Trump’s position. But there are none. You can read his full piece here. Here are three more tips on how to save the planet from author Chris Goodall of Carbon Commentary: Old gas and oil boilers can be hugely wasteful. Even if your current boiler is working well, it’s worth thinking about a replacement if it is more than 15 years old. Your fuel use may fall by a third or more, repaying the cost in lower fuel bills. The distance you drive matters. Reducing the mileage of the average new car from 15,000 to 10,000 miles a year will save more than a tonne of CO2, about 15% of the average person’s footprint. If car travel is vital, think about leasing an electric vehicle when your existing car comes to the end of its life. A battery car will save you money on fuel, particularly if you drive tens of thousands of miles a year. Even though the electricity to charge your car will be partly generated in a gas or coal power station, electric vehicles are so much more efficient that total CO2 emissions will fall. But bear in mind that the manufacture of an electric car may produce more emissions than the vehicle produces in its lifetime. Rather than buying a new electric vehicle, it may be better to keep your old car on the road by maintaining it properly and using it sparingly. The same is true for many other desirable items; the energy needed to make a new computer or phone is many times the amount used to power it over its lifetime. Apple says 80% of the carbon footprint of a new laptop comes from manufacturing and distribution, not use in the home. Further west, the contraction of Lake Chad over the past four decades has created a very different set of problems for surrounding countries, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Some experts even blame the rise of Boko Haram on the disruption to traditional ways of life that the changing landscape has brought about. These maps show just how the lake has diminished over the decades: Patrick Kingsley visited the region for the Guardian at the end of last year, and found locals blaming the climate as much as the insurgents for the catastrophe that had befallen them. If the Lake Chad water was normal all these problems [with Boko Haram] would be eliminated economically, because nobody would have time to do all these things,” said Modu Amsami, a displaced person from northeast Nigeria You can read Patrick’s piece here. Our Egypt correspondent Ruth Michaelson has been to Alexandria to investigate the impact of rising sea levels on the city. Ruth writes: On the southern tip of the Mediterranean, the coastal waters are inching closer to buildings and flooded ancient structures, including the Greco-Roman tombs at Anfushi. Seawater seeping into the groundwater has also made the fragile ground more unstable, resulting in the alarming collapse of some of the city’s buildings. The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050, and say that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable – by 2080, up to 120,000 people living near the sea could be affected by rising waters if no action is taken to protect them. Rising sea levels and seawater temperatures will also increase the salinity of the Nile, Egypt’s primary water source, and increasingly salty water sources could destroy farmland across the Nile Delta. In 2007, the World Bank estimated that 10.5% of Egypt’s population could be displaced by rising waters caused by climate change. She visited the small town of Rosetta – famous for the stone – and found locals struggling to adapt to the unignorable advances of the sea. You have to do what you have to do, and don’t think about the bad weather – the good weather comes from God,” a local fisherman, Ahmed Mohamed Gowayed, told her. “Last year the storm destroyed palm trees, buildings, cars – older people in their seventies said they’d never seen anything like it in their lives. If the weather continues like this I will build a stronger kiosk. You can read Ruth’s piece full piece here. We’re delighted to be working with both Tumblr and Univision today. For a version of this blog in Spanish, check out Univision’s work here. And to contribute to Tumblr’s unique exercise in creating a sort of “climate change quilt”, follow this link. We’re also on Twitter, using #globalwarning as a hashtag ... Right, that’s the introductions done. Later we’ll focus on climate change in the UK and Europe, but before that we’ll turn the focus to a part of the world where climate change is having one of the greatest impacts: Africa. Before we go any further, let’s look at how climate change is actually impacting parts of the world. Run the slider across to see how Arctic temperatures have changed over the past 40 years This one shows the dramatic decline of Lake Chad in west Africa, which has been blamed for large scale migration. And finally, the gradual melt of the ice sheet in Greenland. Carbon expert Chris Goodall says individual actions DO make a difference. Here are three of his suggestions for individual action that will cumulatively make a real impact on humankind’s carbon emissions: 1 Air travel is usually the largest component of the carbon footprint of frequent flyers. A single return flight from London to New York – including the complicated effects on the high atmosphere – contributes to almost a quarter of the average person’s annual emissions. The easiest way to make a big difference is to go by train or not take as many flights. 2 The second most important lifestyle change is to eat less meat, with particular emphasis on meals containing beef and lamb. Cow and sheep emit large quantities of methane, a powerful global warming gas. A vegan diet might make as much as a 20% difference to your overall carbon impact but simply cutting out beef will deliver a significant benefit on its own. 3 Home heating is next. Poorly insulated housing requires large quantities of energy to heat. If you have properly insulated the loft and filled the cavity wall, the most important action you can take is to draft-proof the house, something you can do yourself. Those with solid brick or stone walls will also benefit from adding insulation, but the financial benefits are unlikely to cover the cost of doing the work, over time. First things first – the facts. I know this is the post-fact era, and it’s become rather unfashionable to grub around looking for the truth. But here goes anyway: 1) Warming is happening fast. No doubt about it. For most of the 20th century, average global temperatures bimbled around the 13.5C mark. Now they are closer to 15C. The UK’s Met Office has produced a nice visual of this which really brings home how static temperatures were for a long period, before the past 20 years or so: 2) Scientists agree we are doing this to ourselves. Often good journalism involves balancing arguments. If you quote a Democrat, you need a Republican for balance. If you quote someone in favour of chocolate biscuits, you want a counter view. This has leached into climate journalism, but the vast majority of scientists support the hypothesis that manmade action is contributing to climate change. As this chart makes clear, if we want to strike a fair balance of voices in reporting climate change, we need to speak to more than 30 people who believe in manmade climate change before we give a platform to a sceptic. So we will do that today. We will hear from 30 or so people in the former camp. And we will remind you of what the world’s most famous climate sceptic, Donald Trump, has said. 3) BUT … THERE IS HOPE. There are many great things going on. We’re going to hear lots about these too: what is happening right now, and what you can do to join the global movement. Carbon emissions are flatlining (but need to start falling). Renewable capacity has increased exponentially around the world. In an article we have just published, climate expert Chris Goodall writes: 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. Humanity stands at a fork in the road, with one route descending towards disaster and the other climbing towards a brighter future. The route taken depends on whether the world can tame global warming, which threatens a violent end to the mild and stable climate the world has enjoyed since the start of civilisation. Many fear the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US president on Friday threatens to push us down the dark path. That’s understandable: he has called global warming a hoax and appointed climate-change deniers and oil barons to key posts. But the unpredictable Trump and his team have already stepped back from a threat to abandon the global climate deal agreed in Paris in 2015. Hope remains – just – that with the right advice and pressure, Trump may see the challenge of climate change as the great opportunity it also represents. Beating climate change requires nothing less than rewiring the global economy to run on zero-carbon energy – work that must start now but will take decades. As the climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern tells the Guardian: “The urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood.” But this titanic challenge also offers extraordinary opportunities: trillion dollar markets for green technology and the prospect of a clean, sustainable and fair world. The US is the most vibrant crucible for new technology the world has seen and embracing the transformation to a green economy would deliver jobs and prosperity to many Americans. Will Trump the dealmaker grasp the opportunity before Trump the climate-change denier throws it on a fossil fuel bonfire? Grabbing the chance would be a great way to “make America great again”, as many US cities, states and US businesses already realise. In contrast, not doing so will help make China great again, as its extraordinary transformation into a climate leader accelerates. Indeed the rest of the world’s nations have shown they remain resolute in pushing on, with or without the US. Even Saudi Arabia, which for years frustrated global climate talks, is now backing the renewables revolution with billions. The prize of beating climate change is a glittering one and still just within reach. Global carbon emissions have levelled off. But that only means we are no longer accelerating towards the climate cliff edge – just speeding along at a steady 100mph towards the “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” projected by the world’s scientists. A foretaste of those severe weather impacts has already arrived in many places, via scorching heatwaves and floods made far more likely by the overheating planet. To avoid climate breakdown, emissions must fall to zero in a few decades at most and that means ramping up action right now. Given the scale of the challenge, people can feel powerless to make a difference. But ask the key players around the world what individuals can do and one answer recurs more than cutting down on flying, giving up meat and saving energy: demand action from your elected representatives today. Hello and welcome to this live climate change special, in which we will be reporting from all seven continents on the climate change already underway – and the promise of solutions – in one 24-hour period. The plan is this: starting in London, we will generally follow the sun as daybreak falls around the world. We’ll be in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for the next few hours before crossing the Atlantic to look at the Americas during their morning. And finally we’ll move down to Sydney to hear about Asia-Pacific as that part of the world wakes up on Friday morning. All building towards Donald Trump’s big moment in Washington later in the day. We’re teaming up with social network Tumblr and Spanish-language US broadcaster Univision to cast the conversational net far and wide. Of course, Trump is on record as questioning the science behind climate change, and the link between the warming planet and the transformation of our weather patterns. But we’ll hear from people who, unlike Trump, live on the front line of climate change –in Bangladesh, Egypt, Canada, Bolivia, Malawi, the South Pacific – parts of the world where climate sceptics (or doubters, if you prefer that word) are few and far between. Already today we have heard from more than a dozen top global warming experts who pinpoint why Trump’s revisionism is not just dangerous but a self-inflicted wound. And we have heard Xi Jinping, China’s president, wax lyrical about the urgency of the moment: There is only one Earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland ... It’s not all gloom though. There’s a tremendous amount of work – science, innovation, activism and diplomacy – that should give readers hope. We’ll be highlighting the saviour technology that can yet make a big difference and the little things you can do in your life to join the climate movement. Other highlights will include a quiz, a doomsday carbon countdown clock, a Facebook live attempt to sketch climate change, and a film from the bottom of the earth. Our icons will indicate what each post is about, whether it’s drought, heat, oceans, flooding, food or ice melt – or just advice or commentary. So drop in from time to time, and see how we’re getting on. After all, in the time it’s taken you to read this, we’ve churned out another 100,000 tons of carbon. Next up will be Damian Carrington our head of environment, on why this is such a critical juncture for our species, and indeed every species on this planet. We’ll be reading all comments below the line, please do join the conversation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/02/australian-quantum-theory-climate-denial","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-02T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"The Australian quantum theory of climate denial | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/02/australian-quantum-theory-climate-denial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/02/australian-quantum-theory-climate-denial","fields":{"headline":"The Australian quantum theory of climate denial","bodyText":"I've previously written about the five stages of climate denial. Climate contrarians were exhibiting all five stages leading up to the release of the latest IPCC report in ideologically biased media outlets like Rupert Murdoch's The Australian. Recently, John Cook (himself an Australian, at the University of Queensland) proposed the Quantum Theory of Climate Denial. \"There are various states of climate denial, with some states contradicting others. For example, some believe global warming is not happening. Others believe global warming is happening but is not caused by humans. Others believe humans are causing global warming but that the impacts won't be bad. Now, it's perfectly understandable for a community of people to hold mutually inconsistent beliefs. But can one person hold three inconsistent beliefs at the same time? Can a person argue that global warming is not happening, then smoothly transition to arguing that global warming is happening but is caused by something else? They can, and they do ... It can be explained by the \"quantum theory of climate denial.\" This theory holds that climate deniers exist in a fuzzy quantum state of denial, simultaneously rejecting many or all aspects of climate science.\" Psychologically this can be easily explained, because climate denial is based not on science, but rather on ideology. This denial is caused by a desire to maintain the status quo and/or an opposition to the policies needed to solve the climate problem. Pseudoscientific arguments are only needed as a means to justify those ideological positions. If the problem doesn't exist, or if it's not our fault, or if it's nothing to worry about, then we can maintain the status quo. Any of these arguments will suffice to justify opposition to climate solutions, so even though they're contradictory, those who deny climate realities for ideological reasons can deploy any of these positions at any time. Murdoch's The Australian is a prime example, having in recent months run stories claiming that global warming isn't happening, is happening but isn't due to carbon dioxide emissions, and is happening, is due to carbon dioxide, but isn't anything to worry about. Two of those articles were written by Bjorn Lomborg, a favorite of The Australian. Just a few days ago, the newspaper published another Lomborg piece, this one blaming virtually all of the world's problems on renewable energy. Fossil fuels are lovely – status quo it is! The editorial was full of misleading, unsubstantiated arguments. In essence, 'renewable energy is too expensive and receives too many subsidies, whereas fossil fuels are great for the poor because they're cheap.' Just look at China, suggests Lomborg – if you can see it through the smog-filled air that's causing 1.2 million premature deaths per year. The editorial complained about the billions of dollars in wind and solar energy subsidies, neglecting the approximately $1.5 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies. It claimed that high energy prices are worse for people in poor countries than global warming impacts. Yet a report from Lomborg's own organization found that climate change has already been hurting the economies of poorer nations for many decades. Those countries happen to be the most vulnerable to climate damages. The editorial also complained that Australia's carbon tax has caused energy prices to rise, making it difficult for low-income households to pay their energy bills. The solution to that problem is a simple one – make the tax revenue neutral. While energy prices will still rise in that scenario, the costs to households will be offset when the resulting revenue is returned to the taxpayers. In its state of quantum climate denial, The Australian is happy to swallow Lomborg's flawed economics arguments, or take any other position that justifies the status quo. The quantum theory of climate denial extends far beyond Australia of course. Media outlets, politicians, and others in the US and UK can also often be found to inhabit multiple seemingly contradictory climate positions at the same time. However, given that an ideological opposition to climate solutions seems to be the basis for this denial, it would be nice if we could all move beyond arguing about well-established science and instead debate about climate policies. After all, if we're all honest with ourselves, the climate 'debate' isn't about science at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/small-world/2013/sep/17/nanotech-ultimate-solar-panel","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-17T10:18:51Z","webTitle":"Mother Nature talks nanotech: the ultimate solar panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/small-world/2013/sep/17/nanotech-ultimate-solar-panel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/small-world/2013/sep/17/nanotech-ultimate-solar-panel","fields":{"headline":"Mother Nature talks nanotech: the ultimate solar panel","bodyText":"Scientist: Black metals with a nanostructured surface could be the key to creating better, more effective solar panels, trapping more light than ever before. Mother Nature: So, clever clogs, how does the nanotechnology bit come into this? I'm glad you asked! Black metals are made by treating their surface – roughening them at the nanoscale level to create dips and ridges just billionths of a metre apart. It actually makes them blacker. This gives them lower reflectivity and makes them able to absorb more wavelengths of light. You need all the help you can get with solar energy harvesting – not going so well really, is it? The team at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US have been able to make nanostructures in black metals so that the material is actually tuneable: they can make them as black as they want and can then increase on demand the amount of solar energy the surface absorbs. Making solar cells out of them is next. How grand. But you've only managed to achieve a 10-20% efficiency rate for typical solar cells, haven't you? Not a great statistic in anyone's book. Oh do be quiet for once! I'm trying to educate you a little here, you Luddite. All that I've done for you and you just turn around and bite me on the bottom. There is very little I need educating on, thank you very much. Oh really? You're deluded if you think your precious green plants are better at converting sunlight into energy. Most plants only manage to turn a meagre 1-2% of sunlight into glucose. So there! But they're rather more sophisticated than a photovoltaic panel, aren't they? Plus, I think it's tricky to compare the two: plants convert the sun's energy into chemical energy, whereas solar cells produce electricity. Quite different. Fine, have it your way. I just thought you'd be interested in how we're trying to improve greener forms of energy generation. \"Green\" or not; I don't much like any of it, to be honest with you. None of my other species need to manufacture extra energy. They make do with what they've got and so should you. You're not being reasonable now, are you? There's no way the human race is going to go back to living in caves. I doubt there are enough of them. Caves, that is. There's a vast surplus of you lot. Well, quite. Perhaps I'd have been better off telling you about using nanotechnology to clean up nuclear waste. Hmmm … undoing ills is a little more up my alley.

It survived the 1906 earthquake, endured decades of vandalism and neglect. Recently renovated, it is beautiful, useful, ready for yet another turn on this graceful city’s architectural stage. A phoenix. That’s right, up from the ashes. On the other hand, maybe it’s not that great of an idea to pump up a few hundred supporters in an 1892 relic with terrible acoustics. The building is old. An historic landmark. Its glowing, stained glass dome and intricate gilt moldings shout … antique, dated, of an earlier era, long, long ago. Which is an image the former first lady must shake to appeal to the millennials who have flocked to Bernie Sanders’ camp. The1990s nostalgia for her husband’s administration, critics say, must give way to an image and campaign of her very own. On Thursday, she mixed a yearning for America of a generation ago – “We can just go back 25 years….Everybody prospered together.” – with a dose of anti-Trump fisticuffs. What happened to that vibrant economy, she asked? “Then came the Republicans with their failed economic policies,” she continued. “Trickle down economics. It didn’t work then. It won’t work now. That’s all Donald Trump is offering.” And she finished with a catalogue of promises for the future that brought down the lovely, landmark house, one pledge at a time. “I will defend a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions,” Clinton cried, and the crowd cheered. “And I will defend planned parenthood.” Ditto. “I will defend marriage equality.” See above. “I will defend voter rights...appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn Citizens United... fight for the right of unions to organize... for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship... for criminal justice reform. “And,” she said, rounding out the list, “I will stand up against the gun lobby.” Thanks to some unpledged delegates boarding the Trump Train, Donald Trump now has 1,238 delegates – one more than he needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. “We had a very productive phone call, I’ll leave it at that,” House speaker Paul Ryan told reporters at a news conference after the news, when asked about a phone chat with Trump following Ryan’s denial yesterday that he was preparing to endorse Trump. In response to a later question, Ryan returned to a distinction he has made repeatedly – between “real party unity” and fake unity: “The point is I want real party unity, and that’s what I’m most concerned about.” Politico reports the Republican party is spending $750,000 on a convention after-party that will feature none other than rock band Journey. The event, slated to take place at Cleveland’s State Theatre, will be the capstone of the four-day Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in mid-July, when Donald Trump is expected to emerge as the party’s nominee. The Bernie Sanders campaign has issued a statement saying it is satisfied with the primary result in Kentucky, where it had called for a recanvassing. “We accept the results in Kentucky. We are very pleased that we split the delegates in a state with a closed primary in which independents cannot vote and where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 35 points in 2008. In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Florida senator and former presidential candidate Marco Rubio backed away from possibly serving as his party’s vice presidential nominee this cycle, although he all but guaranteed that he will run for office again in the future. “It’s a safe assumption,” Rubio said of his chances of seeking office, although he ruled out running for reelection in this cycle. “If there’s an opportunity to serve again in a way I feel passionate about it, I’ll certainly explore it.” Two US senators have warned that a new bill would vastly expand the FBI’s warrantless access to Americans’ online records. Although the text of the 2017 intelligence authorization bill is not yet available to the public, two members of the Senate intelligence committee have said the bill could expand the remit of a nonjudicial subpoena called a National Security Letter (NSLs) to acquire Americans’ email records, chat or messaging accounts, account login records, browser histories and social-media service usage. While NSLs typically apply to phone or banking records and email addresses, the bill, which cleared the Senate intelligence panel on Tuesday by a 14-1 vote, appears to change the scope of the longstanding term “electronic communications transaction records”. Senator Ron Wyden criticized the change as a sweeping expansion of warrantless surveillance. “While this bill does not clearly define ‘electronic communication transaction records’, this term could easily be read to encompass records of whom individuals exchange emails with and when, as well as their login history, IP addresses, and internet browsing history,” Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who voted against the bill, told the Guardian. Wyden’s colleague on the panel, Democrat Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, said in a Thursday statement that the measure represents “a massive expansion of government surveillance that lacks independent oversight and potentially gives the FBI access to Americans’ email and browser histories with little more than the approval of a manager in the field”. Donald Trump, on monuments: “I don’t want a wall named after me, but that’s okay. I want a statue in Washington, D.C. Maybe share it with Jefferson. Greta Van Susteren’s “Meet the Trumps” special on Fox News has drawn sharp criticism from media figures: For his first major energy policy remarks, Donald Trump would quote, almost verbatim at times, from an op-ed published in the Grand Forks Herald earlier that morning. But Trump was not the author. The byline belonged to local congressman Kevin Cramer, the longtime champion of his state’s oil and gas industries. North Dakota has boomed and busted right along with the price of gas. Trump would start his speech by telling the state’s oil executives that they were standing at the “forefront of a new energy revolution” powered by Trumpian deregulation and protectionism. As if it had been dredged from the Bakken Formation still dripping with crude, this was a speech both from and of North Dakota. Before the newly confirmed Republican nominee took to the stage in Bismarck, Cramer, a self-professed climate sceptic, had been invited up in front of the press and praised by Trump as a “talented person” bound for a role in his administration. “You’ve changed my life,” Cramer said. “I appreciate your comments on energy, and I’m looking forward to hearing the rest of it.” But of course, Cramer had heard it all before. Saying he was “very excited” to debate Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders told a Ventura College rally this evening that he looked forward to asking the presumptive Republican presidential nominee “why he thinks wages for American workers are too high.” “We’re going to ask him why he thinks climate change is a hoax when the scientific community is almost unanimous that climate change is causing devastating problems,” Sanders said. He also said he looked forward to asking the presumptive Republican presidential candidate “why he thinks that in a nation where our diversity is our strength he thinks it is appropriate to be insulting Mexicans and Latinos.” “We are holding rallies just like this up and down this state,” Sanders continued. “By the end of this campaign here in California I am confident we will have personally met and spoken to over 200,000 Californians. This is a grassroots campaign of the people, by the people and for the people.” Donald Trump pledged to cancel the Paris climate agreement, endorsed drilling off the Atlantic coast and said he would allow the Keystone XL pipeline to be built in return for “a big piece of the profits” for the American people. At an oil and natural gas conference in North Dakota on Thursday, just minutes after he had celebrated hitting the 1,237 delegate mark needed to formally clinch the party’s nomination, Trump gave a speech on energy policy that was largely shaped by advice from Kevin Cramer, a US representative from the state. In a press conference before the event, Trump praised the advice of oil tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm and Cramer then introduced him onstage. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club environmentalist group, was taken aback by Trump’s address. “I have never heard more contradiction in one hour than I heard in the speech,” he told the Guardian. “There are pools of oil industry waste water that are deeper than Trump’s grasp of energy.” Trump gave the speech – which Brune also called “a jumbled collection of oil industry talking points that are devoid from reality in the market place” – in a packed arena that generated an atmosphere more like that of a campaign rally than a staid industry conference. As he hit a number of familiar talking points, a crowd filled with his supporters raised chants of “build the wall”. He did not directly address manmade climate change, which he has in the past called a hoax invented by the Chinese, but he took veiled shots at those who are concerned about global warming. In addition to his pledge to pull out of the Paris climate deal, Trump promised to only work with “environmentalists whose only agenda is protecting nature” and to “focus on real environmental challenges, not the phony ones”. He contrasted this approach with that of Hillary Clinton, whose plan to combat climate change he called “a poverty expansion agenda”. Trump also attacked renewable energy sources, claiming that solar energy was too expensive and attacking wind turbines for “killing eagles”. Without outlining any policy specifics, Trump argued for a focus on clean water and clean air. In January, asked by the Guardian about the Flint water contamination crisis, he said: “A thing like that shouldn’t happen but, again, I don’t want to comment on that.” On Thursday, Trump also made a unique argument about the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would pump shale oil from Canada into the US. Republicans have long supported the pipeline, which was opposed by environmentalists and cancelled by the Obama administration. In exchange for his approval of the pipeline, Trump said, the US would need a “significant piece” of its profits. Shortly after that statement, though, Trump said: “The government should not pick winners and losers.” Trump also seemed unsure whether high oil prices were good or bad. Although at one point in his speech he took credit for oil hitting $50 a barrel, he later enthused about the need for cheap energy. The crowd in Bismarck did not seem confused, though. Cheering wildly, they gave Trump a spontaneous standing ovation. “I will give you everything,” he promised them, adding: “I am the only one who will deliver.” They seemed to believe it. Well, there’s one person who isn’t taking the idea of a pre-primary bipartisan debate between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders seriously - former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. “Oh, Wolf! This doesn’t sound like a serious discussion!” Clinton eyerolled at CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, when he asked the Democratic frontrunner about the current public negotiation over the possibility of a “charity debate” between the two candidates. “I don’t think it’s serious,” she continued via telephone. “It’s not going to happen.” On more important matters, Clinton addressed fallout from an inspector general’s report that she violated rules by using a personal email address for work communication during her tenure as secretary of state. “This report makes clear that personal email use was the practice under other secretaries of state, and the rules were not clarified until after I had left,” Clinton said. “I hope voters look at the full picture of everything that I’ve done, and the full threat posed by a Donald Trump presidency, and if they do, I have faith that they’ll make the right choice.” Writing in the Washington Post, the sister of late White House associate counsel Vince Foster says that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump should be ashamed about using her brother’s death as a pretext for attacking Hillary Clinton, writing in the newspaper that Trump’s comments are “beyond contempt.” “It is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy, but such is the character of Donald Trump displayed in his recent comments to The Washington Post,” Sheila Foster Anthony writes. “In this interview, Trump cynically, crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother, Vincent W. Foster Jr., may have been murdered because ‘he had intimate knowledge of what was going on’ and that Hillary Clinton may have somehow played a role in Vince’s death.” “How wrong. How irresponsible. How cruel.” Calling Trump’s accusations “craven,” Foster Anthony details her brother’s years-long struggle with depression, which ultimately led him to take his own life in 1993 - as confirmed by the results of five investigations. “These outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain because this issue went on for so long and these reports were so painful to read,” she writes. “For years, our family had to wage a court fight to prevent release of photographs of Vince’s dead body. My heartbroken mother was plagued by harassing phone calls from a reporter.” “Through all this time I have not spoken publicly about this matter, out of an effort to maintain our family’s privacy,” Foster Anthony concludes. “I am now, because The Post sought my reaction. I have donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign but have not had contact with anyone at the campaign about my decision to go public.” When Donald Trump declared that “You have to be wealthy in order to be great,” who was he talking about? Let us know in the comments. Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager told MSNBC this afternoon that “backchannel conversations” are already happening between the Vermont senator’s team and that of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, regarding a possible bipartisan debate between the two candidates before the California primaries on June 7. “I think it would benefit voters from across the country and I have to believe it would be one of the most-watched debates in presidential politics,” said Jeff Weaver. “Let’s see if he has the courage to go one-on-one with Bernie Sanders.” The possibility of an unprecedented two-party primary debate first arose last night, when Trump joked on Jimmy Kimmel’s show that he would be willing to debate Sanders. The Trump campaign has since gone back and claimed that the comment was only in jest, although Trump himself later claimed that he was totally serious about the possibility. Sanders, for his part, is more than interested: In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Florida senator and former presidential candidate Marco Rubio backed away from possibly serving as his party’s vice presidential nominee this cycle, although he all but guaranteed that he will run for office again in the future. “It’s a safe assumption,” Rubio said of his chances of seeking office, although he ruled out running for reelection in this cycle. “If there’s an opportunity to serve again in a way I feel passionate about it, I’ll certainly explore it.” Rubio also said that he plans to attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, this summer, although it’s not a sure thing. “My sense is that I’ll go to the convention,” Rubio said. He’d even be willing to speak on DOnald Trump’s behalf, telling Tapper “Yes, I’d certainly - yes,” when asked. “I want to be helpful - I don’t want to be harmful.” Before losing his home state’s primary and dropping out of the race, Rubio told the Guardian that Trump’s nomination would mean the Republican party would “pay a big price in November and beyond.” “I think he’s already an embarrassment,” Rubio said at the time. “People around the world are watching this debate and this campaign and wondering what’s happening here, because the things he says are nonsensical. “When you’re the most powerful and important nation on earth, you’re not always going to be popular,” he added. “But the question is, are you respected? And I don’t think Donald Trump is going to be respected.” Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wants to face off against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in the biggest venue the unlikely duo can find. Trump said earlier today that he would “love” to debate Sanders, telling reporters in Bismarck, North Dakota, that the candidate is “a dream.” “If we can raise for maybe women’s health issues or something - if we can raise $10 or $15 million for charity, which would be a very appropriate amount - I understand the television business very well,” Trump said. Later, an aide to Trump confirmed to the Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui he would not, in fact, debate Sanders – despite the Vermont senator’s willingness to do so. Then, Trump himself walked back that aide’s walkback, which that the possibility of an unprecedented cross-party debate is now ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Speaking this afternoon to a labor union conference in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump an “urgent threat to our rights and our country,” and thanked Bernie Sanders supporters for “challenging us” and laid out proposals to help working families. “Donald Trump likes to say I’m playing the ‘woman card,’ ” Clinton said. “Well, here we are in Las Vegas, right? If fighting for equal pay, paid family leave and affordable childcare is playing the woman card, then deal me in.” The audience included about 300 organizers from the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the country’s largest private sector labor group representing 1.3 million US grocery store and retail chain employees. They offered scathing boos when Clinton mentioned a union-busting effort inside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas. “I was proud to join those workers on the picket line last fall,” she said, drawing raucous applause. “I’m even prouder because they overcame Trump’s intimidation campaign.” “So to everyone who has faced hostile management, a hostile legislature, a union busting governor or all three, help is on the way.” There was also an interesting response to Trump’s old remarks about profiting on the housing crisis. “He was rooting for the housing crisis,” Clinton said. “He said profiting while working families get kicked out of their homes and lose their jobs would be a ‘good result’.... Our country is full of honorable men and women who run businesses and don’t take pleasure in other people’s misery, but not Donald Trump.” UFCW members voted to endorse Clinton before the nation’s first caucuses in January. And before today’s speech, Barb Caruso, an union administrator from Cleveland, said she supported Clinton because she “understands the issues that surround working mothers.” Caruso also expressed dismay over anti-union momentum from Republican legislators. “I’ve been in the labor movement for 41 years,” she said. “So I’ve experienced the drastic change in the political environment towards unions. It’s in every major city and suburb in the country.” Clinton’s speech followed a private meeting with UFCW members who have experienced workplace intimidation and unpredictable scheduling at corporate chains like Macy’s and Albertson’s. She closed her remarks with a conciliatory nod to Sanders, whose waning campaign continues to bruise Clinton from the left, while Trump consolidates support among Republicans. “The only thing standing between Donald Trump and the Oval Office is all of us. And I mean all of us,” said Clinton. “We’re coming to the end of the Democratic primaries. I applaud Senator Sanders and his supporters for challenging us to get unaccountable money out of politics and take on the crisis of income inequality and I look forward to coming together to unify our party to stop Donald Trump and move our country forward.” The appearance included no mention of the yesterday’s state department report acknowledging that Clinton broke agency protocol by using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. The report revealed that Clinton expressed concern about her email accounts potentially being hacked in November 2010, telling a top aid at the time that they needed to discuss shifting onto the state department’s email system. Trump’s Bismarck, North Dakota, press conference was intended to be a victory lap, where the presumptive nominee was preceded on to the podium by over a dozen unbound North Dakota delegates who had pledged their support to Trump in Cleveland. While waiting for Trump in the windowless conference room under bleachers in an arena, several delegates jokingly bickered over which one was the 1237th before Trump made his entrance. But the presumptive nominee spent surprisingly little time taking a victory lap. Instead, he started pivoting towards a general election, hedging on previous positions like a ban on Muslims entering the United States and his support for ethanol. Trump also flip-flopped yet again on a potential debate with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, now saying that he would consider doing so before the California primary but if only the Sanders campaign promised to raise $10 million. The Sanders campaign has issued a statement saying it is satisfied with the primary result in Kentucky, where it had called for a recanvassing. “We accept the results in Kentucky. We are very pleased that we split the delegates in a state with a closed primary in which independents cannot vote and where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 35 points in 2008. “I thank the people of Kentucky very much for their support.” It’s true. Politico reports the Republican party is spending $750,000 on a convention after-party that will feature none other than rock band Journey. Politico: The event, slated to take place at Cleveland’s State Theatre, will be the capstone of the four-day Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in mid-July, when Donald Trump is expected to emerge as the party’s nominee. Will Clinton staffers sneak in? Here they are celebrating her 15 March wins: The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs reports from the room in Bismarck: Context: Further: Trump is asked about attacks on him by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who most recently went after Trump for rooting for the 2008 housing market crash. Trump likes to refer to prior claims by Warren, who was touted as having Native American roots when she was on the Harvard Law faculty, to have Cherokee or Delaware heritage. “Pocahontas? Or is that offensive? I’m sorry about that? Pocahontas. Elizabeth Warren,” Trump says. “She is a senator that is highly overrated. She has passed little legislation,” he says. But he would debate her: “I’ll debate anybody. I don’t care. I’d debate her. And she has done very little for Massachusetts... she said she was Native American but she wasn’t able to document it... she then, I don’t know if you’d call it a fraud... “I think she’s as Native American as I am, that I will tell you. But she’s a woman that’s been very ineffective, other than she’s got a big mouth.” Trump is challenged for having, several days ago, repeated claims that the death of Vincent Foster was a “murder,” despite conclusive evidence that Foster, deputy White House counsel to Bill Clinton, was a suicide. Trump says he was asked about Foster, but didn’t know anything about it, so he decided to repeat what he heard. I really know nothing about the Vince Foster situation. Haven’t known anything about it. A lot of people have been very skeptical... I know nothing about it... I don’t think it’s something that should be part of the campaign. But again if you people reveal something to me, I’ll answer it the appropriate way. How does it feel to cross 1,237 delegates? “I’m so honored. I’m so honored by these people, they had such great sense. Trump’s asked what he’ll do in his first 100 days. “We’ll have many things to do. Number one, I’ll be unwinding various executive orders.” Pertaining to “the border”. “We’re going to start rebuilding our military. ... nobody’s going to mess with us, very simple.... we’re gonna have a lot of fun that first 100 days. We’re going to start the process of making America great again.” Trump says he would build the Keystone XL pipeline and “make our country rich again.” Yes we will absolutely build it... but I want a piece of the profits for the United States. That’s how we’re going to make our country rich again, just one way out of thousands. A lot of times pipelines are so much better... instead of going on trains.... I want it approved for jobs, and the concept for pipelines is OK. Trump once again is asked whether he still supports a ban on Muslims – but he will not answer: “As of this moment, I am very unhappy, when I look at the world of radical Islam... we’re going to find a solution... Obama could never find a solution... I have many Muslim friends, they said to me, thank you, thank you. “We have to have turn-ins,” Trump says, of people who would report terrorism suspects. Trump said he had “a very good conversation” with House speaker Paul Ryan. “That’s moving along, he’s a good man,” Trump said of a prospective Ryan endorsement. Trump is asked about Manafort’s assertion that his proposed Muslim ban was merely a conversation starter. Trump says Manafort was misquoted by the Huffington Post. “I don’t read the Huffington Post... I’m sure he was misquoted. I didn’t think they covered politics?” But Trump won’t repeat his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. “We’re going to look at a lot of different things. But we have a big problem... and we have to find a solution. And we have to be vigilant...” Trump reverses his campaign statement that said he was joking when he said he would debate Bernie Sanders. “I’d love to debate Bernie, he’s a dream. I said, and I said last night ... I’d love to debate him but I want a lot of money to be put up for charity, women’s health issues. If we can raise $10 or 15m for charities. “The problem with debating Bernie is, he’s going to lose. His system is rigged ... it’s so unfair. The biggest problem I have is that Bernie’s not going to win, but I’d debate him anyway. We’ve actually had a couple of calls from the networks already. “I’d love to debate Bernie, but they’d have to pay a lot of money for it. I’d love to debate him. Every single poll, on every single debate – I’ve won every single debate.” Here’s Trump last night on Jimmy Kimmel: Trump predicts that he will win Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, Indiana – “so we’re gonna have tremendous successes. “We were supposed to be going into July... and here I am watching Hillary fight, and she can’t close the deal. And that should be such an easy deal to close. And she cannot close the deal. And we’ll see what happens.” Trump says he’s been audited for 15 years. “The IRS has been very professional.” Trump says he’s willing to release tax returns after his audit is done. “Hopefully it’s going to be before the election, I’m fine with that.” “Probably illegal, we’ll have to find out what the FBI says about it. But bad judgment. It’s devastating... it’s a very, very harsh report... it’s shocking to see, it’s shocking to see what she did.” Trump thanks the crowd. He says he won’t forget North Dakota. Behind him is a group of Republican party officials whom Trump says “got me over the top”. Trump opens it for questions. He’s asked about Obama’s remarks at the G7 that the world was “rattled” and surprised by Trump’s nomination. “He’s a president who’s done a horrible job,” Trump replies. “Everybody understands that. It’s unusual that every time he gets a press conference, he’s talking about me. “He shouldn’t be airing his own [politics] where he is right now.” Trump shot down a contention in a Huffington Post interview by his “convention manager,” Paul Manafort, that he would not consider a woman or minority as a running mate because that would be “pandering.” Trump says he was likely to consider a woman or person of color. “We’re looking for absolute competence,” Trump said. As for Manafort: “He’s been misquoted a lot.” Trump enters the room and approaches the lectern. Live stream here. Donald Trump was joking when he offered on late-night TV Wednesday to debate Bernie Sanders, reports Guardian politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui: An aide to Trump said he would not, in fact, debate Sanders – despite the Vermont senator’s willingness to do so in the absence of Hillary Clinton, who has declined to participate in a final Democratic debate. Each Memorial Day weekend, hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists converge in Washington DC for a downtown procession to honor military veterans. Donald Trump is going, his campaign has announced. “I am doing it in honor of the great bikers who have been totally supportive of my campaign and now I want to be supportive of them,” Trump said in a statement to Bloomberg Politics. “I look forward to it!” Trump is due to speak any moment in Bismarck, North Dakota – in his first remarks since he clinched the Republican presidential nomination. A live video stream is below. The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs is at the scene. Clinton cues a fundraising callout to Trump clinching. When it became clear that Donald Trump would claim the Republican presidential nomination, party chair Reince Priebus had two choices: resign or get behind the nominee. Bloomberg Politics’ Joshua Green gets inside that decision and much more in a newly published profile titled How to Get Trump Elected When He’s Wrecking Everything You Built. The piece is tidbit-rich. In an interview with Trump, Green asks what Trump thinks the Republican party would look like in five years. “Love the question,” he replied: Five, 10 years from now—different party. You’re going to have a worker’s party. A party of people that haven’t had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry. What I want to do, I think cutting Social Security is a big mistake for the Republican Party. And I know it’s a big part of the budget. Cutting it the wrong way is a big mistake, and even cutting it [at all].” The piece continues: He explained the genesis of his heterodox views. “I’m not sure I got there through deep analysis,” he said. “My views are what everybody else’s views are. When I give speeches, sometimes I’ll sign autographs and I’ll get to talk to people and learn a lot about the party.” He says he learned that voters were disgusted with Republican leaders and channeled their outrage. I asked, given how immigration drove his initial surge of popularity, whether he, like [Alabama senator Jeff] Sessions, had considered the RNC’s call for immigration reform to be a kick in the teeth. To my surprise, he candidly admitted that he hadn’t known about it or even followed the issue until recently. “When I made my [announcement] speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech,” he said, “I didn’t know about the Gang of Eight. … I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess.” Read the full piece here. Well that’s an unfortunate choice of stock photo. “We had a very productive phone call, I’ll leave it at that,” House speaker Paul Ryan tells reporters at a news conference, when asked about a phone chat with Donald Trump following Ryan’s denial yesterday that he was preparing to endorse Trump. In response to a later question, Ryan returns to a distinction he has made repeatedly – between “real party unity” and fake unity: “The point is I want real party unity, and that’s what I’m most concerned about.” In the same Huffington Post interview in which he said that his boss Donald Trump’s call for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States was merely a conversation-starter and not an actual policy proposal, Paul Manafort, Trump’s convention manager, said that Trump would not choose a woman or a member of a minority group. “In fact, that would be viewed as pandering, I think,” Manafort told the Huffington Post. Manafort said that Trump’s running mate search is active. “He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn’t want to do. He seems himself more as the chairman of the board, than even the CEO, let alone the COO.” “There is a long list of who that person could be,” Manafort added, “and every one of them has major problems.” Read the full interview here. A press release from William Hill explains that the bookmaker, who had quoted Trump at 33/1 to win the Republican nomination, and at 150/1 to win the race to the White House, “now make him just 7/4 (36% chance) to become the next President of the USA”: ‘Mr Trump’s progress towards the nomination has been an astonishing transformation from complete outsider in the betting to red hot favourite’ said Hill’s spokesman Graham Sharpe. ‘Once he is confirmed as the Republican candidate we can begin paying out to those who were shrewd enough to bet on him – and there are plenty of them.’ Donald Trump has announced plans to hold a victory news conference in just over an hour in Bismarck, North Dakota (it’s the capital), where Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs is laying in wait. DT Jr celebrates victory: Others register disbelief: Thanks to some unpledged delegates boarding the Trump Train, Donald Trump now has 1,238 delegates – one more than he needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination – and – confetti. The AP reports: Trump was put over the top in the Associated Press delegate count by a small number of the party’s unbound delegates who told the AP they would support him at the convention. Among them is Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard. “I think he has touched a part of our electorate that doesn’t like where our country is,” Pollard said. “I have no problem supporting Mr. Trump.” A state department inspector general’s report on Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email address and secret home server during her time as secretary of state reveals that Clinton, who along with top aides declined to be interviewed for the probe, maintained the server as a secret from all but her inner circle for months after the clintonemail.com domain was first registered. The report also reveals that state department staffers raised concerns about Clinton’s private server when they found out about it, on the grounds that emails handled by the server might not be preserved for the public record, as required by federal regulations. But those concerns were dismissed by a senior official. The Associated Press reports: In one meeting with [John A. Bentel, then director of the Office of Information Resources Management], a staff member worried that messages sent or received using the private server could contain documents that needed to be preserved under federal regulations. Bentel told the staff member that State Department legal staff had “reviewed and approved” the server— though the inspector general’s review found no evidence such a review had ever occurred. In that meeting and another that Bentel had with a different staff member who raised concerns, Bentel directed the staff members to “never to speak of the secretary’s personal email system again.” In January 2011, a Bill Clinton aide wrote to a Hillary Clinton aide saying that the server had been the target of a hack attack: “Someone was trying to hack us,” the aide told [top Clinton aide Huma] Abedin. Later the same day, it happened again. “We were attacked again so I shut (the server) down for a few min,” he said. The next day, Abedin warned [Cheryl] Mills and [Jake] Sullivan not to send Clinton “anything sensitive” in their emails. The AP has further: The State Department inspector general’s release of the 83-page report provides new insights into the server: Who knew about it, its vulnerabilities and the bureaucratic mismanagement that allowed the secret system to operate outside normal channels throughout Clinton’s tenure. The findings — more than a year in the making — also show how the use of private emails by Clinton and other top aides caused internal headaches for the few State Department officials who knew of its existence and for an agency that has long struggled to comply with federal cybersecurity and record-keeping requirements. Read AP’s latest report on Clinton’s emails here. The Washington Post this morning has published a scathing assessment of the state department probe findings: HILLARY CLINTON’S use of a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 has been justifiably criticized as an error of judgment. What the new report from the State Department inspector general makes clear is that it also was not a casual oversight. Ms. Clinton had plenty of warnings to use official government communications methods, so as to make sure that her records were properly preserved and to minimize cybersecurity risks. She ignored them. “There is no excuse for the way Ms. Clinton breezed through all the warnings and notifications,” the Post concludes. “While not illegal behavior, it was disturbingly unmindful of the rules.” An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll of the American public last October found that 47% of respondents thought Clinton’s use of a private email server was “important”. Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Bernie Sanders has responded in the enthusiastic affirmative to an offer of unclear seriousness from Donald Trump to debate him before the 7 June California primary. Appearing on late night funnyman Jimmy Kimmel’s show on Wednesday, Trump said he would be glad to debate Sanders mano a mano – for charity. At which Sanders, whose supporters routinely cheer his stump speech attacks on Trump, and who has failed to lure Hillary Clinton into a similar California showdown, tweeted that he was game: Meanwhile Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, told the Huffington Post that the candidate’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States was just a conversation-starter: He’s already started moderating on that. He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he’ll soften it some more. He’ll still end up outside of the norm, but in line with what the American people are thinking. Barack Obama, speaking at the G7 summit, said that the world was “surprised” by the prospect of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president: They are rattled by it and for good reason. Because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines. Trump is to speak today in Bismarck, North Dakota, with the Guardian’s Ben Jacobs at the scene. Later Trump will travel to Montana. Hillary Clinton is to speak in Las Vegas this morning – with the Guardian’s Dan Hernandez reporting – and San Jose and San Francisco, California, where our reporter Sam Levin will be in attendance, this afternoon. Bernie Sanders will speak in Ventura, California.

Growing faster than almost any other segment of the tech industry, global investment in the sector reached nearly $3bn last year. As well as bumper profits for investors, fintech innovations hold out hope for major social returns too. We look at innovative ideas in areas where opportunity for impact is ripe. Banking the unbanked Africa is home to the largest unbanked population on the planet. Four in five adult Africans do not use formal banking services. In Ethiopia, the rate is even lower, with as many as 90% of people unbanked. Addis Ababa-based financial technology firm Kifiya is working to change that. Established in 2010, the start-up has worked with the government to set up a unified billing system called Lehulu. The system automatically collates electricity, water and landline phone charges into one single bill. Householders in Addis Ababa can pay their primary utility bills altogether in one of 31 centres that Kifiya operates across the capital city. Kifiya also offers a branchless banking service enabling unbanked customers to conduct basic transactions. The system, which is accessed via a registered card or biometric data, relies on itinerant agents visiting communities with a specially tailored internet-enabled hardware device. A Little World's Zero platform and FINO PayTech offer similar branchless banking services in rural India. Mobile payments Mobile phone-based paying is where a lot of the action is at these days. Mobile phone ownership is high in countries such as Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania, where Vodafone's national subsidiaries operate the hugely successful M-Pesa mobile payments service. Wizzit in South Africa and GCash in the Philippines demonstrate how fast the mobile money market is developing. Mobile payments are sparking associated innovations too. Take the M-ledger app, for example. The brainchild of two amateur programmers from Kenya, the app scans SMS messages sent by M-Pesa to confirm transfers and then collates these on an onscreen dashboard. The service enables M-Pesa users to manage their payments more fully, checking them by date, amount and recipient. Payment problems aren't just a developing world phenomenon, 23% of US transactions by value are made in cash. Some use cash because of concerns about digital security and online fraud. Others simply can't afford the charges associated with banks and credit cards. Alternatively, they may well lack the documentation or credit history necessary to open a bank account. California-based PayNearMe enables consumers to pay their rent remotely, make purchases online and make other transactions that have typically become electronic. Equipped with a PayNearMe Card or PaySlip, cash users simply need to enter one of the 17,000 participating 7-Eleven, Family Dollar and ACE Cash Express stores and make their payment. Using a proprietary embedded barcode technology, the cash is transferred automatically to the biller's account. The approach avoids the need for costly and complex money orders, as well as reducing the labour costs and fraud risks associated with collecting cash on-site. Disability and financial services Lack of banking infrastructure prevents many from accessing banking services, but it's not the only barrier. Disability can act as an obstacle to financial inclusion too. Blindness is the most obvious case in point. Blind or partially sighted customers face difficulties reading the screens on cash machines. Back in 2012, UK bank Barclays responded by equipping more than 3,500 of its ATMs with audio instructions, which individuals with sight difficulties can listen to via a set of headphones. The bank also issues high visibility bankcards to facilitate their use at ATMs and with chip and pin devices. In rural regions of India, the barriers are more educational than physical. Many are either entirely illiterate or unable to read Hindi or English, the country's primary administrative languages. Chennai-based Vortex Engineering has designed an ATM that seeks to overcome these problems by using fingerprint authentication and multi-language screens in regional languages. The system is widely used by the State Bank of India. To increase its suitability to rural conditions even further, Vortex's Gramteller Duo cashpoint is also designed to be energy efficient (requiring less than 100 watts) and heat tolerant (operating in temperature up to 50C). Vortex has a second design – the Ecoteller – that can be powered by solar energy. Aggregating aids Online trading platforms have made us all (potential) stockbrokers now. That said, we still need to do the laborious work of identifying the right stocks to buy. For sustainability-minded private investors, the challenge is more taxing still as the relevant data is often hard to find or tricky to decipher. Motif Investing runs a low-cost trading platform that promises to take the hassle out of stock selection. The California firm has compiled over 100 ready-made, professionally built portfolios (or 'motifs) linked around specific themes or ideas. Most are fairly conventional. If you want to know what stocks will benefit from trends in private equity or the boom in online gaming then Motif offers a list to pick from. But sustainability gets a look in too. Among the options on offer are portfolios linked around the smart grid, water shortage, 'fossil free' and income inequality. The latest monthly return on Motif's socially responsible portfolio is 4.3% - half a percentage point above the company's Seven Deadly Sins selection. Technology is helping pool donor cash, not just investor finance. Yimby provides an illustrative example. The brainchild of UK employee-giving advocate JustGiving, the service provides a platform for communities to crowdfund for local projects. Over 700 projects have so far been funded through Yimby, which charges a 5% fee for successful projects. The finance hub is funded by EY.

The aero engine maker announced after the market closed on Friday that it was buying out the stake held by Daimler, the German carmaker, in the Rolls-Royce Power Systems partnership. Daimler has exercised its right to sell its shareholding to Rolls, which will pay for the stake, said to be worth around £1.9bn, with a mixture of cash and debt. Rolls has jumped 27p to £10.53, but Finnish engine maker Wartsila has fallen back as analysts said Rolls was now less likely to bid for the business. In a buy note Liberum analysts said: Rolls has ample liquidity to fund [the deal] from existing facilities. Our 2015 earnings per share will increase by around 7% to 77p but our sum of the parts valuation falls by 75p to account for the reduction in cash offset by an increase in value for 100% control. Questions will be raised on timing but an equity raise for another industrial like Wartsila now seems more unlikely. Overall markets have shaken off a slide in Asian markets following poor export data from China over the weekend and continuing concerns about the situation in Ukraine. So despite the worries, the FTSE 100 is currently 31.29 points higher at 6743.96. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, said: You might have expected more of a negative reaction from European markets this morning given the weekend's events, but equities remain defiant despite rising concerns in both China and the Ukraine. Chinese stocks were down 3% overnight after suffering on more than one front from the weekend's news. Exports sank 18% in February against average estimates of a near 7.5% rise, casting further doubts over China's ability to hit the 7.5% growth target set by Premier Li. However the greater concern may well be debt, with Friday marking the first default in China's corporate bond market from Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy. Bulls will hope that the decision to allow the failure shows a hard stance from Beijing that might curb reckless lending, but \"debt crisis\" is a term that still strikes fear into the majority of investors and in the short term Chinese markets seem more that a little concerned of what is still to come. Mining stocks have been hit by the concerns about a slowdown in China, a key consumer of commodities. Fresnillo has fallen 29p to £13.76, while BHP Billiton is down 27p at 1821.5p and Antofagasta has lost 12p to 865p. Elsewhere Vodafone is 3.7p lower at 234.95p after reports it had offered €7bn for Spanish cable company Ono. Back with the risers, paper maker Mondi is up 27p at £11.18 after Citigroup moved from neutral to buy and raised its price target from £11 to £12.60. Citi said: Mondi continues to deliver rising returns (return on capital employed of 17% forecast for 2014), strong earnings growth (18% year on year underlying earnings per share growth and 7% EBITDA growth in 2014) and rising dividends at an attractive valuation, on our estimates. Pharmaceuticals group Shire is 64p higher at £33.20 following news that Barclays had lifted its price target from £32.75 to £36."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-wyke-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-15T09:46:15Z","webTitle":"Wyke Farms cheddar goes green – in a good way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-wyke-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-wyke-farms","fields":{"headline":"Wyke Farms cheddar goes green – in a good way","bodyText":"There are some very special cows in Somerset – not only are they producing milk to make award-winning cheese, but their poo is helping to power the dairy where that cheese is made. This is no small artisan operation. Wyke Farms is the largest independent cheese maker in the country. And with a range of innovative energy-saving technologies, including a biogas plant fired by dung and other farm waste, the company is making huge savings on its annual power bill – £1m, which will be trebled to £3 m in the next 12 months. Thanks to the investment, Wyke Farms is the first national cheddar brand to be 100% self-sufficient in green electrical energy. By installing a biogas plant, the company has not only saved on energy, but is also reducing its haulage costs, as pig and cow manure is no longer treated as waste, but as a precious fuel to be used on site. In addition, the spent material from the plant will be used as fertiliser, saving on the cost of artificial nitrogen for Wyke and neighbouring farms. Before commissioning the biogas plant, the company met a range of stakeholders including local people and financiers, to explain why it was committed to renewable energy. It took five years to plan and build the plant, which consists of three digester vessels, each measuring 4,600 cubic metres. The facility can convert up to 75,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste materials from the farm and dairy, including pig and cow manure, into energy every year. The first phase of the biogas plant is now complete and the energy generated is running a combined heat and power plant to power the cheese dairy. In the second phase of the project, to be completed by September this year, the company expects to save up to a further £2m, as it will no longer need to buy gas from the grid. The company argues that the biogas project goes above and beyond standard environmental practice, as many manufacturers are yet to take steps to move to 100% sustainable waste management practices. Wyke Farms has also installed a number of solar arrays to help to manage peak daytime electrical loads that are not covered by the biogas plant. The result is that the firm will be able to get its entire electricity and gas supply from both solar and biogas, and will export power back to the grid. Altogether, there will be a saving more than 5 million kilos of CO2 a year. The cheese and butter are made by milk produced by cows grazing the lush pastures of the Mendip Hills in Somerset. The Wyke Farms dairy has been sited here for well over a century and there is a deep commitment within the family-run business to minimise its impact on this beautiful environment, and to operate in a more sustainable way. Richard Clothier, managing director and third-generation family member at Wyke Farms, says: \"We aim to operate our business in a way that has minimal impact on the Somerset environment and to create a truly symbiotic relationship with the countryside. We're committed to energy efficiency and we're proud to be one of the first national food brands to be self-sufficient.\" He adds: \"Sustainability and environmental issues are increasing in importance to each and every consumer in the UK and green energy makes both emotional and practical sense. It simply closes a cycle. We can now take the cow waste, which has inherently been a problem, and turn it into pure, clean energy to drive all our own needs and more. This in turn leaves a natural fertiliser that we can plough back into the land to invest in the future health and wellbeing of our cattle – and so that cycle starts again.\" The biogas plant is part of a comprehensive sustainability strategy that permeates throughout the organisation. This includes minimising waste not only by reducing packaging, but also by reusing 85% of the farm's water. The company has also encouraged wildlife within the Brue Valley in Somerset, by leaving conservation areas on riverbanks for nesting birds, deer and other animals. The company has three electric vehicles, which it charges from its own solar energy and uses for local cheese deliveries. As part of this commitment to spreading the sustainability message, the company has also opened an on-site green energy visitor centre. Tenacity, enthusiasm and passion for the environment have been the key drivers in keeping Wyke ahead of the game when it comes to sustainability.

For most progressives, it's like hearing \"the liberal case for the death penalty\". A contradiction in terms, surely? Well, readers of this paper will already know about the new ideas being ventilated on this issue from George Monbiot's writings. This documentary, from Robert Stone, sets out to think the unthinkable and ask the unaskable: should we learn to stop worrying and love nuclear energy? Stone's case is that it has been massively misunderstood and misrepresented by a 60s generation of environmentalists: he argues that nuclear is a hugely efficient and relatively clean energy source that is now vitally needed as billions of people in emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil are hungry for power. Wind turbines and solar panels, he says, are failing to meet even a fraction of urgent needs. But the film has been criticised for deriding wind and solar energy unduly. Perhaps the film could have spent longer on safety – and it is a little glib in its dismissal of the issue. Holding up the Geiger counter at a disaster site and showing the surprisingly low number is a bit obtuse and smug, and doesn't address people's fears about an explosion. The anti-nuclear protesters are compared to climate-change deniers because of their dismissal of science: actually, some of the smooth pro-nuclear rhetoric sounded like that of the climate sceptics. This film certainly chops up a few sacred cows. Could it be that the anti-wind brigade will have to make common cause with climate change scientists?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2014/may/14/clean-energy-and-conservation-cuts-in-budget-broken-promises-say-agencies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-14T04:52:31Z","webTitle":"Clean energy and conservation cuts in budget broken promises, say agencies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/14/clean-energy-and-conservation-cuts-in-budget-broken-promises-say-agencies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/may/14/clean-energy-and-conservation-cuts-in-budget-broken-promises-say-agencies","fields":{"headline":"Clean energy and conservation cuts in budget broken promises, say agencies","bodyText":"The government has been accused of breaking its word by cutting key clean energy and conservation programs in the budget, amid fears that renewable energy projects will be forced to go overseas for funding or perish. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), which helps drive research and investment in clean energy, is to be wound up and merged into the Department of Industry, saving $1.3bn. The Coalition had pledged its support for Arena before the election. Arena’s chief executive, Ivor Frischknecht, said he wasn’t surprised by the decision of treasurer Joe Hockey, who recently labeled a wind farm “utterly offensive”. “Arena accelerates our transition to cheap, clean energy, but that acceleration won’t happen now,” he told Guardian Australia. “I’m disappointed by this and so are our stakeholders, who want to invest in renewables but now can’t do so. “We don’t have long-term bipartisan agreement on what to do in this [renewables] space yet, unlike in Europe. The unfortunate reality is that the government needs the funding for other areas.” Frischknecht said the clean energy sector “can’t be faulted” for thinking the government is ideologically opposed to it. The government’s alternative climate policies would not properly replace Arena, he said. A total of 181 Arena-funded projects, worth close to $1bn, will continue. But Frischknecht said a further 190 proposed projects, worth about $7.7bn, probably would not. The deputy chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, Kane Thornton, said axing Arena would force clean energy firms to look overseas for funding. “There are a bunch of companies who rely on the support given by Arena and there is now no future for them in Australia,” he told Guardian Australia. “This decision is disappointing, particularly given the Coalition’s long-standing support for Arena.” The budget had no funding for a Coalition election pledge to provide solar energy to an additional 1m households. The apparent antipathy towards anything deemed clean, green or renewable was further highlighted by the decision to change the name of the Clean Energy Supplement to the Energy Supplement. The Landcare program has also been radically pared back, despite a commitment from the Coalition before the election not to cut its funding. The scheme, which works on regeneration of landscapes, will be merged with the Caring for our Country initiative to create the National Landcare Program. This will result in a $483.8m funding cut over five years. Some of the duties of Landcare will be taken up by the $525m “Green Army”, which will put 15,000 mostly young people to work on regeneration projects by 2018. The initiative has been criticised for paying participants as little as half the minimum wage. The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said the broken Landcare promise was a “slap in the face for conservation heroes in the bush, in cities and on the coast”. “The Green Army initiative is a useful land restoration program that ACF welcomes, but it is in no way an answer to the massive problem of climate change and its impact on Australia,” she said. The budget confirmed the $2.55bn funding to establish the emissions reduction fund, which will be the centrepiece of the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy, to replace carbon pricing. However, the money will be spread out over 10 years, instead of the four years as previously promised, casting further doubt on whether it will be enough to achieve the goal of a 5% emissions cut by on 2000 levels by 2020. Other cuts include $2.8m stripped from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority over four years, while the Bureau of Meteorology will have its budget slashed by $10m over this period. CSIRO’s budget has been reduced by $111m. A merger of environment and climate change research programs into the new National Environmental Science Program will save $21.7m, while funding for biofuels and algal technology – an innovation often promoted by environment minister Greg Hunt – has been cut by $5m. Offsetting this, $40m will go towards tackling the threats faced by the Great Barrier Reef and $300,000 will be given to Melbourne Zoo to facilitate the release of 60 orangutans back into the wild in Indonesia. The BoM will get a new “supercomputer” and the government will buy a new icebreaking ship to support Australia’s Antarctic research stations. “A new icebreaker is long overdue and the previous government had been negligent in failing to put aside the required funding,” Hunt said. Hunt said the budget showed the protection of the Great Barrier Reef was a “top priority” of the government and predicted the Green Army would make a “real difference to the environment and local communities” through its projects, which will be announced soon. Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, said: “Tony Abbott’s destruction of Australia’s environment protection system ruins any chance Australia has to prepare for the environmental challenges of the future. “This budget takes the Abbott government’s assault on the environment and climate to a new level, and shows a disdain for science and research that threatens decades of investment and innovation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/24/why-geoengineering-suits-russias-carbon-agenda","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-24T10:59:53Z","webTitle":"Why geoengineering suits Russia's carbon agenda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/24/why-geoengineering-suits-russias-carbon-agenda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/24/why-geoengineering-suits-russias-carbon-agenda","fields":{"headline":"Why geoengineering suits Russia's carbon agenda","bodyText":"News that Russia is calling for geoengineering be considered by the IPCC as a possible response to global warming makes a perverse kind of sense. No government, not even those of Canada and Australia, has been more eager to open up new sources of fossil energy than Russia’s. By offsetting the effects of global warming – by, for example, coating the Earth with a layer of sulphate particles to reduce the amount of sunlight – geoengineering promises to allow the world to have its carbon cake and eat it. The contradictions of geoengineering appear most starkly in the Arctic. Melting summer sea ice has made the Arctic global warming’s canary in the coal-mine, the place that most keeps climate scientists awake at night. Yet the Arctic, a large portion of which is controlled or claimed by Russia, is a new carbon El Dorado, holding up to a quarter of the globe’s undiscovered oil and gas reserves. According to one energy industry insider: \"Climate change is opening up one of the last frontiers for hydrocarbons on our planet. The Arctic … could be set for rapid change and development as exploration, production and infrastructure will have an inevitable, irreversible impact.\" In a provocative move, in 2007 a Russian submarine managed to plant the national flag on the seabed under the North Pole, and a year later the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, declared: \"Our first and main task is to turn the Arctic into Russia’s resource base of the 21st century.\" He was not talking about solar collectors. The Russian government’s determination to prevent obstacles to get in the way of Arctic exploitation was demonstrated last week when commandos boarded a Greenpeace ship and pointed guns at the activists’ heads. Russia’s control over exports of gas and oil to Europe is its biggest strategic bargaining chip. Its bullying of former Soviet satellite states is well known, but even Germany’s dependence on Russia for over a third of its oil and gas supplies is enough to lead a military-linked thinktank to urge the Merkel government to soft-pedal in its diplomatic dealings with its eastern neighbour. Global efforts to reverse the world’s dependence on fossil fuels threaten Russia’s plans for its economic and strategic future. Challenging IPCC science would marginalise it from the global negotiations, so carrying the torch for geoengineering – it would be the first nation to do so – has a kind of logic to it. In 2010, Russia joined with Japan in an attempt to water down a resolution to restrict research into geoengineering at a meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In pursuing the climate engineering agenda, a Russian government is likely to face fewer domestic constraints than more developed democracies. Pro-geoengineering analysts writing for a US conservative thinktank have argued that nations with weak environmental lobbies (meaning China and Russia) will be able to deploy \"solar radiation management\" with muted internal opposition. This, they wrote, is one of its advantages. If true, solar radiation management is the dictator’s technology of choice. China, increasingly fearful of environmental catastrophe, has recently included geoengineering among its earth sciences research priorities. There is a long history of attempted weather modification in Russia, especially as part of the cold war arms race. In 1960, in a book titled Man versus Climate, two Russian meteorologists matched American technological hubris when they wrote: \"Today we are merely on the threshold of the conquest of nature. But if … the reader is convinced that man can really be the master of this planet and that the future is in his hands, then the authors will consider that they have fulfilled their purpose.\" The world’s most vigorous proponent of geoengineering is the Russian scientist Yuri Izrael. As director of the Research Institute of Global Climate and Ecology at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, he was the first to carry out tests of aerosol spraying, albeit at low altitudes from helicopters, to gather data on the optical characteristics of various particles. Izrael is said to have been close to President Putin. Although an IPCC vice-chair until 2008, Izrael at times gives the impression of being a climate science denier. He invited the guru of American deniers, Richard Lindzen, to a conference of the Russian Academy of Science in 2004 and himself featured at a 2008 conference of the Heartland Institute, which was excoriated last year after it compared climate scientists to the Unabomber. Izrael has variously claimed that warming will not be harmful, that the Kyoto protocol has ‘no scientific basis’, and that it would be cheaper to resettle Bangladeshis threatened by sea-level rise. And he argues for geoengineering instead of emission cuts. Other scientists in Russia seem embarrassed by his antics and describe him as a \"fossil communist\", but he remains influential. Izrael has frequently collaborated with Andrei Illarionov, once President Putin’s top economic adviser. Invoking nationalist resentments Illarionov described the Kyoto protocol as war against Russia. In the Moscow Times he wrote that it was killing off the world economy like an \"international Auschwitz\". There are some more reasonable Russian voices talking about geoengineering, including a handful of scientists modeling the impacts of sulphate aerosol spraying. However, they argue that geoengineering is inevitable because carbon emissions are growing by more than the IPCC’s most pessimistic projections: \"Therefore, humankind will be forced to apply geoengineering to counter the unwanted consequences of global warming.\" It’s an argument echoed in the text now being put forward by Russia to modify the summary of the latest IPCC report. In 2009 I met a Siberian meteorologist at a conference. She told me that many people in Siberia would welcome a couple of degrees of warming. She knew enough about how the Earth system works to understand that any benefits from warming would be fleeting, as the Earth is unlikely to call a convenient halt once it reaches that threshold, and certainly not once the Arctic has thawed. But that is a piece of science many have yet to learn. • Clive Hamilton is the author of Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Age of Climate Engineering (Yale University Press 2013)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/microsoft-walmart-google-renewable-energy-wind-farm-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-04T22:05:37Z","webTitle":"Why corporations like Microsoft are investing in renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/microsoft-walmart-google-renewable-energy-wind-farm-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/microsoft-walmart-google-renewable-energy-wind-farm-solar","fields":{"headline":"Why corporations like Microsoft are investing in renewable energy","bodyText":"In a move that underlines the growing appeal of corporate investment in renewable energy, Microsoft announced Monday that it will power one of its data centers with electricity from a Texas wind farm. The software giant has agreed to buy all of the output from the 110MW wind farm for 20 years. The project, to be built by RES Americas, will send electricity into a local grid that serves a Microsoft data center in San Antonio. Construction is set to start next year and be completed in 2015. For businesses that want to cut their carbon emissions, renewable energy might sound like a natural choice. But for years, the more popular option has been for businesses to buy renewable-energy credits associated with renewable-energy-generation projects rather than investing in those projects directly. Buying credits seems easier: it doesn't require a business to sign long-term power contracts or commit the hefty capital – and time – required to build its own wind or solar-power projects. But as the wind and solar markets grow, thanks in large part to federal and state tax breaks and other subsidies, the cost of building and owning renewable-energy projects – along with the price of renewable energy – has steeply declined. The average long-term price for wind power to US utilities plummeted to $40 per megawatt-hour, in 2012 contracts, from $70 per megawatt-hour in 2009, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report. Meanwhile, the marketing benefit of investing in renewables remains strong. Buying wind power or owning wind farms, for example, represents a deeper commitment to fighting climate change than simply buying credits. Both approaches provide the crucial, long-term capital for growing the renewable energy market. In many cases, they also help companies reduce their utility bills and could even generate profits in the long run. Google, Walmart and others Microsoft, of course, is hardly the first corporation to invest in renewables. Google has been a trend setter, both signing long-term wind-power contracts and investing in building wind and solar farms. The company buys renewable energy that flows into grids where its data centers are located. It also co-owns renewable energy power plants that sell electricity to utilities, and Google expects to make good returns on those investments. Overall, the company has invested – or agreed to invest – in more than $1bn worth of wind and solar power projects than collectively exceed 2GW of generation capacity. Aside from signing power purchase agreements, a growing number of businesses also have installed renewable-energy equipment on their own properties to generate power on site. Solar panels' smaller footprint – they sit atop unused space on roofs instead of requiring a dedicated piece of land like most wind turbines – makes solar appealing for onsite generation and use. Corporate investment in solar energy, whether via solar-electricity purchases or onsite installations, also is growing: the top 25 corporate solar-electricity users have enabled the installation of more than 445MW of capacity in the US to date, a 48% jump from a year ago, the Solar Energy Industries Association reported last month. Walmart took the top spot on the list, followed by Costco, Kohl's, Apple and Ikea. Overall, commercial solar-power projects nationwide reached 3,380MW in the second quarter of this year, up 40% from a year ago, according to the solar industry trade group. Challenges remain But while renewable-energy costs have declined, it still remains more expensive than power from coal or natural-gas power plants in many parts of the country – at least during times of lower demand. (Utilities tend to charge higher rates when demand is high, such as at the hottest times of day during hot summer months.) That means an investment in renewable energy would only make financial sense – meaning companies would make up the cost in energy savings over a decent payback period – for companies that use a lot of energy and have to pay a premium for it. Asking companies to commit money long-term to buy renewable power or own renewable-energy projects remains a tough sell when they could use that capital for growing their core businesses. But as more businesses, particularly well-known brands such as Microsoft, invest in renewable energy, they help to nurture the young renewable-energy industry, lower the price of wind and solar and promote the use of clean power. And that will ultimately benefit both the public and the companies themselves. Ucilia Wang is a California-based freelance journalist who writes about renewable energy.

But then he never really meant to establish it in the first place. A self-professed \"wandering hippy\", the one-time furniture maker ended up in Martha's Vineyard, where he built a house in 1975. He stayed and set about building more. It was only when someone noted that he was effectively \"subsidising buildings for the rich\" that he thought a more formal, profit-making approach would make sense. Hence Abrams found himself the owner of a small but successful design and construction firm. Then, some time later, two of his longest-standing employees came to see him. He expected they wanted to leave and set up on their own, as is the custom in the building trade. In fact, they wanted to stay – only with a bigger stake in the business than just a worker's wage. \"It occurred to me that if we were successful in doing what we were doing, this situation would come up over and over again,\" Abrams reflects. \"So why not devise a structure that would invite people in and give them a full voice?\" Giving workers a stake He decided to sell them a share of the company. And in 1987, South Mountain Company was born as a democratically managed worker cooperative – one of more than 100 such enterprises now registered with the US Federation of Worker Cooperatives. Still based in Martha's Vineyard, it boasts 32 employees today – 21 of whom are owners, with the remainder on track to gain shares too. For inspiration, South Mountain drew heavily on the principles of the Mondragon Cooperative movement in Spain's Basque region. Joint ownership lies at its core. After five years' service, any employee is given a buy-in option. The current price is around $13,000, which Abrams calls significant but not too high for the average worker to \"scrape together\" (the company's initial benchmark was the cost of a used car). \"We thought we were just institutionalizing what we were already doing,\" says Abrams, who describes the atmosphere in the company as always being \"pretty familial\". \"Yet they (owner-employees) become invested [and] committed in a different way.\" That's because, as owners, everyone has a stake in the company's success – as well as its possible failure, of course. Just over one third (35%) of profits are divvied up equally among all employees. Half of the remainder is split between the owners, and payable when they leave or retire. All major decisions are made collectively. If a consensus can't be reached, then resolutions are passed by a 75% majority vote (a measure that Abrams and his co-owners have only had to resort to twice in 25 years). If it all sounds completely unmanageable, it's not. As Abrams, who serves as the chief executive, puts it: \"You don't want people drawing straws for who designs the stairway. You want the best person at designing stairways to do that.\" The trick is distinguishing between policy and management decisions. He gives the example of workforce expansion: It's the owners' role to decide if new employees are needed; it's management's job to go out and actually hire them. Selling on, not selling out The one-time hippy has few regrets about effectively letting his company go – albeit with preferred stock options. Staff retention is one of the main upsides, he says. Many of South Mountain's employee-owners end up staying their entire careers. Such longevity creates levels of shared vision, mutual support and institutional memory that would be the envy of most firms. Employee ownership isn't without its downsides, mind you. Anyone who has created a business from scratch will encounter understandable trepidation at letting go. \"It felt like control was slipping away, that I was tugging on the reins of a runaway horse,\" Abrams recalls. Of late, the bigger challenge has been trying to keep the business from growing stale. \"As the group of owners grows older and more secure … we've felt that we were becoming less nimble, less innovative and more risk averse,\" he says. To stave off the threat of staidness, South Mountain intentionally hires young recruits. The tactic appears to be paying off. From its design and building roots, South Mountain has developed a successful line in solar energy services over recent years. Bringing younger people on board addresses 64-year-old Abrams' other big concern: the future of the business he started. \"Baby boomers like me, who have started two million businesses and have put heart and soul in them for 30 years, are trying to work out … what they are going to do with them,\" he notes. Retirement is often the time business owners opt to sell out and cash in. But what hope is there for the values on which they have built up their companies? Employee ownership provides the likes of Abrams with a guarantee of continuity. Abrams may have started out his business with no real game plan, but he has no doubt now. \"We are building the human infrastructure to take this company through the next 40 years,\" he says.

Their mission? To close a huge investment gap. More specifically, the 500 investors and policymakers examined how to make a four-fold jump in current investment levels – an additional trillion dollars is needed annually to finance the low-carbon technologies that will help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. In a report by Ceres, the non-profit focused on sustainable business practices, $1tn is needed above current levels to invest in renewable energy such as wind and solar, energy efficiency and energy smart technologies such as power storage, fuel cells, and carbon capture. So why does the UN care what large institutional investors do with their money? Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, urged businesses and investors to finance clean energy solutions on a massive scale because low carbon technology is critical to limit climate change, she said. Investors are failing to do their part. Financing of clean energy and efficiency projects lagged for the second year in a row. Last year, investors spent $254bn globally on clean energy, a 12% drop from 2012, according to new research data released by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. According to the International Energy Association, $36tn in additional investment is needed by 2050 to limit global warming. \"Smart policies, creative incentives, and innovative financial instruments by governments are already catalysing a shift; it is time to scale these up world wide,\" said Figueres. \"Meanwhile investors need certainty, a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies in order to level the playing field and full disclosure of companies carbon footprints in order to make informed decisions.\" On a practical level, investors will need to be persuaded to put money in clean energy. \"Cost competitive renewable technologies and attractive investment opportunities exist right now, but we're still not seeing clean energy deployment at the scale we need to put a dent in climate change,\" said Ceres president Mindy Lubber. To get the money flowing, Ceres recommends bringing capital costs down for clean energy projects, according to Mark Fulton, senior fellow for Ceres who authored Investing in the Clean Trillion. To start, Fulton said that companies must set a goal to boost clean energy investments, such as a commitment – or even aspiration – of 5%, which he believes would send a powerful signal to markets to help scale investments. In addition, Fulton's analysis recommends better pricing of fossil fuel capital costs, which are artificially low. Fossil fuel companies fail to account for carbon asset risks, such as stranded assets of coal and oil, a long-term portfolio risk due to consumer demand with the increase in other energy sources such as gas, solar and wind.

Di Carlo, who co-directs the Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (Chose), thinks there's a real prospect of this happening in the not so distant future. \"The basic research is already there,\" he says, \"and we are working to liberate it from the lab and turn it into viable solutions for the market.\" \"Organic solar cells\" use biological molecules to mimic the light-capturing component of photosynthesis, incorporated into ultrathin, flexible panels. This year Chose presented a prototype of an emergency tent with integrated organic solar panels. These are currently visible as patches on the fabric, but according to Di Carlo, soon enough we won't see them at all. Hiding solar cells in a fabric's weave is just one of many possibilities for an invisible energy revolution. One day they could be built into car roofs, cellphone cases, windows and building materials, for example. Chose was established at Tor Vergata University in 2006, but organic solar cells were first developed in the early 1990s by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne as part of the family of \"thin film solar cells\" – layers of photovoltaic materials just one micron (one-thousandth of a millimetre) thick. The cells usually comprise a photo-active layer sandwiched between two conductive electrodes. Scientists all over the world study photosynthesis with a view to reproducing its mechanism to generate electricity or biofuels. By contrast, researchers working on organic solar cells aim to reproduce just the first, light-capturing step of photosynthesis using natural pigments, for example from wild berries or aubergine skin. The pigment molecules absorb photons and transfer their energy to an electrically conducting layer made of titanium dioxide. Despite being developed two decades ago, organic solar cell technology is not yet mature enough to be competitive in most parts of the world. Some countries have now made photovoltatic-generated energy competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels, known as \"grid parity\" – at least for specific markets. For example, Italy has achieved grid parity in its residential power generation and Cyprus in its industrial sector. But for now, grid parity can only be achieved through a combination of government subsidies, good solar conditions and high fossil fuel prices. According to Di Carlo, to reach grid parity and make solar energy stand alone without subsidies would require what he calls a \"pervasive photovoltaic system\" – in which solar cells are built into the very fabric of cities. At the moment, photovoltaic technology is not efficient enough to produce a significant amount of energy from a small surface. And if conventional solar cells are still well behind fossil fuels in terms of efficiency, thin film solar cells are even less productive. The solution proposed by Di Carlo is to exploit the advantages of thin film cells to hide solar panels everywhere: \"in the structure of a building, in a cellphone case, in a tent's fabric, on a car roof\". These cells are cheaper and can be produced easily using a technique similar to printing. They are also very light and flexible, and can be as transparent as glass. \"I see a future in which every window will be photo-active. By engineering solar cells to capture infrared light, invisible to the human eye, we can obtain completely transparent solar cells that can be integrated in glass without shielding the visible light.\" Di Carlo and his team are looking at pervasive solar energy as one of a group of applications that will revolutionise our energy supply without changing the shape of our cities. \"Energy will be produced and consumed locally,\" he says. \"The whole idea of electricity supply will get closer to the concept of an information technology network. Now we generate and transport energy in a well-defined hierarchical way, but in the future we will see it as a nontangible flow that is generated and utilised locally.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/chinas-choice/2013/aug/14/china-investment-energy-saving-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-14T12:55:00Z","webTitle":"China to invest in energy saving industries to tackle pollution | Jennifer Duggan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2013/aug/14/china-investment-energy-saving-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/chinas-choice/2013/aug/14/china-investment-energy-saving-pollution","fields":{"headline":"China to invest in energy saving industries to tackle pollution","bodyText":"China is to fast-track expansion and investment in energy saving technologies in an attempt to tackle its worsening pollution problems.

Under the plan, environmental protection industries will receive funding from the government in an effort to stimulate technological innovation. The funding will cover a wide range of technologies that address air, water and soil pollution including energy saving products, waste disposal, electric vehicles and pollution monitoring. Many analysts welcomed the plan and some were quoted in the Chinese media as saying that it will create opportunities for investors and will give direction to the industry. \"It's good to see this and it's an indication that development of environmental protection and energy saving industry is a priority, since it's coming from the State Council,\" said Alvin Lin, China Climate and Energy Policy Director with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Beijing. The plan also includes policies, standards, pilot programmes, financing mechanisms and incentives, emissions and carbon trading said Lin. However Lin believes that the plan is \"vulnerable to being so broad as to be lacking focus and hard to implement. \"I think it could discuss more on the importance of implementing standards and policies in order to create the demand for the energy saving and environmental protection market, and the importance of accurate measurement and public reporting to ensure standards are met,\" he said. Ailun Yang, a senior associate with the World Resources Institute, said the initiative is \"encouraging\". \"It shows the ambition of the Chinese government to tackle its growing environmental problems while making the country the world's biggest manufacturer of the environmental protection technologies.\" She added however that more details need to be known before it is possible to assess the effectiveness of the new plan. Tackling pollution has been a priority of the new administration under Xi Jinping, especially as pollution has become a major concern among Chinese citizens and is one of the main causes of social unrest. In an effort to tackle the problem, China has also committed to reducing its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45% by 2020 from 2005 levels and is aiming to increase renewable energy to 15% of its total energy consumption. \"Going forward, I think it would be important to develop a yearly inventory of various energy saving and emissions reduction products and services to get a more accurate idea of the growing size of the industry and the economic value and green jobs created, to demonstrate the economic benefits of improving the environment,\" said Lin. The announcement that funding will be available to environmental protection industries may help China's ailing solar industry. In recent years the Chinese solar industry has been struggling with overcapacity, international trade disputes and slowing global demand. \"The problem with the solar industry is that China didn't have a strong domestic market while the manufacturing capacity of the Chinese solar industry was overwhelming,\" said Yang. The new plan should prioritise creating an \"enabling environment and support the development of domestic market,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/08/mobile-banking-digital-finance-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-08T16:13:00Z","webTitle":"Cashing in: why mobile banking is good for people and profit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/08/mobile-banking-digital-finance-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/08/mobile-banking-digital-finance-companies","fields":{"headline":"Cashing in: why mobile banking is good for people and profit","bodyText":"Whether it is lack of access to water, energy or education, development professionals are well versed in the plethora of challenges facing billions of people. The traditional approach to solving these problems has been to think big – in terms of the millennium development goals, government aid programmes, or huge fundraising campaigns. But there are dozens of startups and larger companies with innovative ideas who are approaching these challenges in new ways using digital finance. The success of M-Pesa, which reaches 18.2m registered users in Kenya alone, shows (pdf) how digital finance can become rooted in a country's economy, but success stories aren't limited to Kenya. Digital finance has taken off in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, where BKash [development] serves 8m registered users with payments and remittances through a network of 76,000 agents, and Pakistan, where EasyPaisa, the third largest mobile money deployment in the world, reaches 7.4m users. Chidi Okpala, director and head of Airtel Money – Africa, a mobile money service with an active base of 5m customers, sees mobile financial services \"tapping in\" to other areas like healthcare, agriculture, and education. Bridge International Academies is one company that's already ventured into the education space in Kenya. Its \"academy in a box\" relies heavily on technology to deliver quality, affordable education to children whose families live on less than $2 a day. So far, the for-profit education company has enrolled over 80,000 students in the programme, which equips teachers with a tablet to deliver standardised instruction. Parents use mobile money accounts to pay the approximately $6 monthly fee, 40% cheaper than other low-cost private schools in the company's communities. Bridge makes the financially complicated process of paying for school easier for families by digitising it (94% of Bridge's families have mobile phones) and making it more affordable. The success of M-Pesa and Bridge International illustrates that well-defined needs can be addressed with creative applications of digital finance – what CGap refers to as 'digital finance plus companies' and the Washington-based partnership has identified more than 50 in 12 countries who are taking new and exciting approaches to increasing access to clean water, energy, education, health and agriculture. Whether it's Sarjaval building affordable access to safe drinking water in India, EcoEnergy Finance providing solar energy to communities in rural Pakistan, or others, all these companies share two common characteristics: they aim to solve a fundamental access problem and they rely on digital finance to make their model work. It can be expected that some of these businesses will disrupt traditional models of providing basic services to communities at the base of the economic pyramid. Still, enthusiasm surrounding digital finance must be tempered with caution. The industry is young, and many of these businesses have yet to prove whether or not they can scale in order to make an impact. Technology is certainly not a silver bullet to ending global poverty, and there have been obvious challenges in using it to reach the unbanked. These include, for example, low uptake of mobile offerings – as shown in Nigeria and Ghana, the preference for in-person transactions in countries like Pakistan, the manner in which illiteracy nearly guarantees that mobile banking will leave some people – especially women – behind, and inactive registered customers. These aren't challenges with obvious solutions, but each scenario offers lessons for future projects. What gives digital finance plus companies an advantage is that they set out to tackle problems that are central to the lives of poor people. And ultimately, these companies recognise the high-growth opportunity associated with powering their innovations with mobile financial services – 50% of people in the developing world now have access to a mobile phone even if they don't own one. As GSMA, the association of mobile phone operators, has pointed out, more people have access to the mobile network than energy or water. In this way, we see a potential win-win scenario: not only could digital finance be a game-changer, bringing poor people into the formal financial system, but it also stands to directly benefit companies who can take their ideas to scale and reach millions of under-served people.

Premier Li Keqiang told lenders to China's private sector factories they should expect debt defaults as the world's second largest economy encounters \"serious challenges\" in the year ahead. Speaking after the annual session of the national people's congress, Li Keqiang said: \"We are going to confront serious challenges this year and some challenges may be even more complex.\" He told lenders to China's private sector factories they should expect debt defaults. Li said China must \"ensure steady growth, ensure employment, avert inflation and defuse risks\" while also fighting pollution, among other tasks. \"So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives,\" he added. \"This is not going to be easy,\" he said. Li's warning followed the failure of Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy to make a payment on a 1bn yuan (£118m) bond last week. The default was the first of its kind for China and widely seen as pointing to the end of 11th-hour government bailouts for troubled enterprises. Some analysts said the decision to let some indebted firms collapse was a sign the authorities had learned from the Japanese boom and bust experience of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tokyo was plunged into two \"lost\" decades of stagnation after it prevented zombie companies from declaring bankruptcy – even blocking petitions from bondholders in the courts - when a property collapse exposed debts many times the value of their businesses. However, figures this week revealed that Beijing is copying the Japanese tactic of ramping up public infrastructure spending to replace the steep slowdown in private sector investment. Fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 17.9% during the first two months of 2014, the National Bureau of Statistics said. China's industrial production rose at its slowest pace in five years with surveys showing a faster slowdown than expected. Industrial output, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, rose 8.6% in January and February year on year, which is the lowest pace of growth since the 7.3% annual growth figure recorded in April 2009. The figures covered a two-month period owing to China's lunar new year holiday week, which fell in both months. Retail sales gained 11.8% in the two months from the year before, the lowest since an 11.6% increase in February 2011. The pessimistic data surprised economists but followed indicators for manufacturing, trade and inflation that also suggested weakness in China's economy. China's GDP grew 7.7% in 2013, unchanged from the year before, the slowest growth since 1999. Li said this month that Beijing was targeting economic growth of about 7.5% in 2014, the same target as last year. Société Générale said in a research note that the results were a confirmation of \"fast deterioration of China's economic growth\". But Julian Evans-Pritchard, Asia economist for Capital Economics, said officials were unlikely to intervene. \"Limited and seasonally distorted data over the last few weeks have made it difficult to make sense of what's really happening in China's economy,\" he said in a note. \"Despite this broad evidence of a slowdown, we don't think policymakers will necessarily step in to support growth,\" he said, adding that officials were \"comfortable with a moderate slowdown\". The figures come as China's leadership says it wants to transform the growth model away from an over-reliance on often wasteful investment, making private demand the driver for the country's development. A reliance on public sector investment while the private sector rebalances away from low margin manufacturing relies for its success on the economy maintaining the government's growth target. Li said: \"Last year, without taking any additional short-term stimulus measures, we succeeded in meeting our target. Why can't we do this this year?\" He emphasised the target was approximate. \"This 'about' shows that there is a level of flexibility here.\" At any rate, he said authorities were not focused on the figure itself, but how it contributes to improving livelihoods, saying growth \"needs to ensure fairly full employment and needs to help increase people's income\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/oct/10/low-carbon-world-sceptics-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-10T10:48:29Z","webTitle":"Memo to sceptics of a low-carbon world – 'It's happening'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/oct/10/low-carbon-world-sceptics-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/oct/10/low-carbon-world-sceptics-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Memo to sceptics of a low-carbon world – 'it's happening'","bodyText":"This year, the US is on track to install one solar energy system every four minutes. Not bad you might think, especially in a country where powerful oil and gas interests are keen to block progress on clean energy. But there is a country that knocks the baseballing nation for a cricketing six – Bangladesh. Late last year, the award-winning renewable energy scheme Grameen Shakti celebrated the installation of its 1 millionth home solar energy system – and that in one of the world's poorest counties. That's one every 90 seconds. Individual examples of this sort of practical, grassroots climate action are impressive and inspiring, but rarely reported. So this year, we're publishing our second annual \"it's happening\" gallery designed to inspire, excite and counter the insidious narrative from the climate sceptics and go-slowers, that the UK is engaged in some kind of unique and isolated climate folly. It's not an exhaustive survey of global climate action, we make no claims for its comprehensiveness. It is a ticker tape of examples from around the world of individuals, communities, businesses and yes even other countries putting in place the building blocks of a low-carbon world. Some are on a grand scale – such as Spain's concentrated solar power stations which, by super-heating molten salts that hold their heat for many hours, can generate clean power from the sun at night. In France, the next generation of the TGV will use 20% less energy and carry 25% more passengers. Some examples are simply charming: the rhinos at Whipsnade zoo now wallow in a renewably heated pool. Of course these collectively are nowhere near the carbon cuts we need. While some are significant, others are pinpricks. The point here though is not the combined clean kilowatt hours generated or the total CO2 saved. There are plenty of sobering presentations by eminent academics which will show you the forbidding scale of the cuts we must make. Alongside this sort of serious assessment of the task at hand, and the recent sobering IPCC report, we need a positive vision of what a low-carbon world might look like. Campaigners are great at policy roadmaps for the low-carbon transitions of this or that sector (I've written a few myself). This is not one of those. Instead it offers a glimpse of the world as it can be, showing that those mountainous IPCC graphs can be climbed and that people are setting off on their own journey to scale them. They are not waiting for Nigel Lawson and Peter Lilley to see scientific sense or for the Treasury to decide it's cost effective. Humanity has the ability to tackle climate change – it just lacks the inclination. Alongside a fear of the consequences of inaction must come an optimistic sense that \"doing it low-carbon\" is not just possible but often better; and far from treading a lonely path, we are part of a global community taking practical action. Climate sceptics seek not only to cast doubt on the science but also to convince us we are alone in our endeavour. These examples show communities taking action to tackle climate change whether or not the world's governments get their act together and come up with a global agreement (though it would make things easier if they did). Perhaps we could call this climate optimism – a full appreciation of the gravity of the science, combined with faith in the ability of humanity to come up with a solution, and a willingness to get stuck in to make it happen. A few years ago the only signs that we were moving to a low-carbon future were compact florescent lightbulbs and the odd hydrid car. Now the world around us is (all too slowly) learning how to go low-carbon. From the transformation of much loved icons of the community – Middlesbrough FC will soon be powered by wind – to other invisible but no less important changes, such as Bath converting its streetlights to highly efficient LEDs. Or Chicago, which is doing the same to its traffic lights. Then there's Portugal, which now gets 70% of its power from renewable sources. And 10:10's own Solar Schools programme is making a difference too. \"It's happening\" is nothing more or less than a collection of carbon cutting actions that get us out of bed in the morning, or that we email round the office. They are collected together so that carbon cutters everywhere can share their favourites with friends, colleagues and family. • Dave Timms is acting executive director of 10:10"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/jul/25/the-inconvenient-truth-in-the-push-to-scrap-the-renewable-energy-target","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-25T09:30:21Z","webTitle":"The inconvenient truth in the push to scrap the renewable energy target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/the-inconvenient-truth-in-the-push-to-scrap-the-renewable-energy-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jul/25/the-inconvenient-truth-in-the-push-to-scrap-the-renewable-energy-target","fields":{"headline":"The inconvenient truth in the push to scrap the renewable energy target","bodyText":"When it comes to the Abbott government’s determination to scrap or wind back the renewable energy target (RET), numbers don’t always count. The prime minister, who after the election took control of a RET “review” and appointed businessman Dick Warburton – a self-professed climate sceptic – to head it, says the RET needs to change because it is pushing up power prices. “We have to accept that in the changed circumstances of today, the renewable energy target is causing pretty significant price pressure in the system and we ought to be an affordable energy superpower … cheap energy ought to be one of our comparative advantages,” Tony Abbott said last year. Inconveniently, the idea that the RET is significantly pushing up prices has now been challenged by several sets of modelling. ACIL Allen modelling done for Abbott’s own review shows the current target will increase the average household bill by an average of $54 a year between now and 2020, but will reduce bills by a similar annual amount over the following decade compared with what they would be if the RET were repealed. That modelling used assumptions highly unfavourable to renewable energy, including that coal and gas prices would remain almost unchanged until 2040. Separate modelling for the Clean Energy Council by Roam Consulting – with different assumptions about gas prices – found that bills would be $50 a year lower by 2020 if the RET were retained. Another modelling exercise, commissioned by three business groups from Deloitte, found household bills would rise by at most about $50 a year. None of those numbers – those saying the RET leaves householders better off, or the ones that say it will cost, at the very worst, less than $1 per week – swayed the prevailing opinion within the Coalition that the policy, which requires 41,000 gigawatt hours of power to be sourced from renewables by 2020, must change. Supporters of the RET, including the environment minister, Greg Hunt, were arguing the 2020 target should be pared back to maybe 25,000 or 30,000 gigawatt hours, which would allow a few new investments to proceed, but not many. There would, perhaps, be another longer term target for 2025 or 2030. Others, believed to include the prime minister, wanted to see it shut down for any new investment, with incentives only for existing generators. But then another set of numbers came into play, the same ones playing havoc with so many of the government’s plans in the Senate. Any change would have to get through the upper house. When Clive Palmer stood beside Al Gore and said he would countenance no change to the RET until after the next election, because the government had gone to the last election promising not to change it, those Senate numbers became extremely difficult, unless Labor could be persuaded to strike a deal, which appears unlikely. But as the government awaits the Warburton review, due in a few weeks, it has been dawning on everyone involved that the goal of stopping new investments in renewables could also be achieved by simply doing nothing. As Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported last week, the abolition of the carbon tax and the total uncertainty over the future of the RET has completely stalled investment in renewables already. No new projects have been financed since the end of 2012, and only a tiny amount has been spent in the first six months of this year. That leaves the renewables industry – especially the solar providers – turning to a third set of numbers – the kind that politicians often find hard to ignore. Opinion poll after opinion poll has found Australians support renewable energy, and are in fact prepared to pay even more than $1 a week to back it. Polling for the Climate Institute released last month showed 72% of Australians wanted to keep or expand the RET. Even when respondents were told “opponents of the scheme say the RET is a subsidy that drives up electricity bills, while supporters say it has helped create jobs and has tripled Australia’s wind and solar energy since 2009”, 71% still thought it should remain at its current level, or be increased. Those kind of numbers have inspired the Australian Solar Council to begin a marginal seats campaign, asking voters to demand that their sitting Coalition MP lobby for a clear statement from the government that the RET will not be changed in any way. They are starting in the Coalition’s second most marginal seat of Petrie, in Brisbane, where party leaders are being invited to a community forum and sitting MP Luke Howarth is being asked to take a stand. He told Guardian Australia he was a big supporter of solar power and renewable energy. “There are obviously mixed feelings about it, but I think renewable energy is a good thing,” he said. Next stop is the Victorian marginal of Corangamite, where the new Liberal MP Sarah Henderson was quick to issue a statement saying she wanted to “ensure that we have a strong, operative RET which continues to drive the uptake of renewable energy and returns certainty to this industry”. But other backbenchers, such as Angus Taylor, who has been a longtime and fierce opponent of the RET, say the business-commissioned modelling shows “the RET is creating a huge and unnecessary cost burden for businesses and households”. Opposition to the RET within the Coalition is driven by a potent mix of a deep hostility to wind turbines, as evidenced by treasurer Joe Hockey’s comment to the (anti-wind) Alan Jones that he found them “utterly offensive”, a barely disguised climate scepticism (as evidenced by agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce, Ian Macdonald and Craig Kelly all suggesting that the fact the carbon tax repeal occurred on a cold winter’s day proved it had been unnecessary), and a belief that indefinite fossil fuel use is not a threat to the planet, but rather is crucial to human advancement. Abbott’s top business adviser, Maurice Newman, wants the RET scrapped altogether and has said that persisting with government subsidies for renewable energy represented a “crime against the people” because higher energy costs hit poorer households the hardest and there was no longer any logical reason for them. Many Coalition MPs see the world that way. Ian Macdonald spoke during the carbon tax repeal debate wearing an “Australians for Coal” hi-vis jumpsuit. The new Queensland senator Matthew Canavan used his maiden speech to say: “I want to put on the record my admiration and support for our fossil fuel industry and the thousands of jobs it supports … Fossil fuels have made more contribution than almost any other product or invention towards humanity's long ascent from lives that were nasty, brutish and short to ones of comparative luxury and leisure. The only form of energy that I want to promote is cheap energy”. And Taylor told parliament “religious belief is based on faith not facts. The new climate religion, recruiting disciples every day, has little basis on fact and everything to do with blind faith.” It is an improbable basis for a coherent renewable energy policy, especially when the renewable energy target was intended as a supplementary policy to the carbon tax – which the Coalition has abolished – and when the entire energy market is in turmoil because billions of dollars in investment were made on the basis of wildly incorrect forecasts about electricity demand. A properly functioning policy process would rethink the way the electricity market operates and the best market incentives to reduce the emissions it produces. But we don’t have a properly functioning policy process, and the government isn’t even entirely clear it accepts the climate change problem the renewable energy target is designed to solve. In the meantime, the industry is reaching for the only set of numbers that gives it some clout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/shift-circular-economy-crop-waste-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-25T13:01:15Z","webTitle":"Shift to a circular economy is under way, from crop waste to solar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/shift-circular-economy-crop-waste-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/shift-circular-economy-crop-waste-solar","fields":{"headline":"Shift to a circular economy is under way, from crop waste to solar","bodyText":"We are currently in a linear economy. We find and extract raw materials, including agricultural products, we process and consume these and then throw our goods away, even calling them \"waste\". Today, members of the Circular Economy 100 along with business and academic leaders meet in London for the annual Circular Economy 100 summit to explore systemic issues surrounding the move towards a circular system, where all kinds of – intermediate – forms of waste will be the input for the next round(s) of producing products. With a circular approach we can address the big challenges regarding the world food problem, the uneven distribution and consumption of raw materials, waste, climate change and developing new (bio-) renewable alternative energy sources. From a linear to circular world When you look to the world, to nature, to the universe, everything is circular. Everything in the universe turns and processes in circles. Life itself is circular. Nature has already discovered that you can only keep a process going when it is circular. We often talk about the scarcity of raw materials, including agricultural crops. This is true and untrue at the same time, since in reality there are no scarce resources; we just make them scarce. When you think about it, there are no atoms leaving our planet, except perhaps for some helium. Almost all atoms stay on earth, but often at a different location or blended and mixed in a different way. For instance, a lot of carbon that used to be underground in the form of coal, oil and gas is now, after being used (burnt) in the air, bounded with oxygen and we call it carbon dioxide or CO2. Metals dug up from mines in Africa are back in Africa, but this time as part of a large e-waste-dump. These atoms or metals are difficult to re-use, since they are mixed with others, but they haven't left our planet. In order to continue using raw materials and providing for all people in the world, we should change and reorganise our world around four main elements: (1) redesign supply chains; (2) innovation and technology development; (3) change in consumer behavior; (4) policies and regulations that enable such changes. Some of this is already being put into practice. Here are some examples: Make more from crop waste Agricultural crops are mostly used for their carbohydrate components. The rest is often called waste and is, for example, used as animal feed, finally being consumed by humans as meat. Or worse, it's used as landfill or, worst of all, we pile it up and set it on fire, creating CO2. This is what is happening with the corn production in the US. After harvest, 30% of corn crop residue (pdf) (the waste, the corn-stover) needs to be moved from the land otherwise the soil will suffocate. The other part needs to remain as a kind of fertilizer. Instead of landfilling or burning this waste, corn crop residue, through converting the cellulose contained in it, is being upgraded into useful products, starting with advanced biofuels (ethanol). The same is possible with the other components, such as proteins: why not upgrade it for human consumption? This is not just a supply chain change (using the \"waste\"), but also a change induced by enormous, complicated technological innovations, supported by hopefully consistent US policies and regulations. After thousands of years of agriculture, we still have so many parts we call waste, or parts we waste. All this while the petro-chemical industry manages to recover every tiny fraction of the fossil sources after being in business for just 150 years. Use CO2 as a resource A second example is carbon dioxide, carbon atoms that were under the ground, now located in the air, can also be used. Carbon atoms are essential for life and materials. We need carbon atoms for many things, like materials, fuels, organic compounds and food. It's already possible to use these carbon atoms from the air, but the current status of the technology, combined with the low prices of emitting CO2 and the subsidies on using fossil resources, means it is still an expensive process. However, since it is proven to be possible, we can look at doing more in the future. Technology will develop further and hopefully policies will too because we can't continue the current track with fossil resources. All this will allow us to transition more rapidly from the fossil-age into the (bio-) renewable-age. Get more from the sun Another example of moving towards a circular economy: coatings for solar energy. New films that trap sunlight can be be applied to already existing solar panels, increasing yields by around 10%. But what will happen to the panels at end-of-life? By retaining ownership of the panels and not selling them, by remaining responsible and providing the coatings for free, applying them and taking the panels back after the product life is over, business can jointly share the benefits of the 10% increase in electricity output with the solar panel operator. This is a different business model, triggered by the circular economy and mode of consumption where you don't sell the product itself but the functionality of the product. This will allow us to transition from consumers to users. A new world from the same sources To successfully change our economy from linear to circular, we as consumers need to change our behavior as well. We are quick to talk about responsible behaviour and circular economy, but the moment we change from a citizen or voter into a consumer we often behave differently. However, we are still the same person. As a consumer, we should change, we should walk the talk and become a user instead of a consumer. Our linear economy can't continue without endangering next generations. We need to make it circular. It is possible!

In one press release, Andreas Nauen, chief executive of Senvion Australia, a windfarm builder, said any change to the RET would compromise the company’s existing investments and “damage Australia’s international reputation as a safe place to invest”. “Once the trust has gone, once the knowledge has gone, once the jobs have gone, then restarting the clean energy industry takes a lot of effort,” the release said. Nauen has good reason to be irritated. In February, Senvion Australia received development permission to begin work on a new windfarm project in the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. That project should end up being worth $1.5bn and create 500 construction jobs, with 50 more sustained over the 25-year life of the project. But now the company says investment in windfarm projects has stalled, making it impossible to know when the project will be completed and come online. In economic jargon, this is called “sovereign risk” and occurs when a government’s decisions make business investment unreliable. Richard Inwood, the managing director of Tindo Solar, the country’s only domestic solar panel manufacturer, says the uncertainty created by the RET review has effectively “kneecapped” the industry and will force his company to revise its plans for growth, which is a tragedy for the renewable energy industry that once seemed to be doing everything right. Already well-established in countries such as Spain, Germany and China, clean energy offered a way to tackle climate change while setting up a new industry at a time when the manufacturing sector had been declining due to a high Australian dollar and structural changes within the economy. The Renewable Energy Target (RET) was the core mechanism in making this happen. Initiated in 2001 under the Howard government to help build Australia’s clean energy industry, the program was expanded under Labor. Under the RET, Australia is required to ensure that 41,000 gigawatt hours of the country’s energy comes from renewable sources by 2020. With a largely unexpected drop in electricity demand, that figure is likely to be nearer 26% of the country’s energy by 2020 than the 20% that was initially envisaged. The lesson from this is that the RET has largely been a huge success. When Warburton, a self-professed climate sceptic, calling for the program to be either closed to new entrants or scrapped entirely, it spelled chaos for the $20bn renewables industry – and the South Australian economy in particular. The state is expected to struggle after 2017 with the closure of the local car industry, which will shut the Elizabeth Holden factory and cause the loss of 1,700 jobs. Most of the factory’s 33 direct Australian suppliers are also expected to go, along with a good chunk of the 700-800 companies in the wider supply chain. The bad news doesn’t end there. Another recent report from the Department of Defence threw up questions about the future of the state’s defence manufacturing industry and reports that the federal government was considering buying “off the shelf” submarines from Japan instead of sourcing them locally from the Australian Submarine Corporation, which built the Collins Class submarines, have added to the state’s fears. Doing so would effectively gut the last major manufacturing industry in South Australia, potentially putting thousands out of work and increasing the risk that the state will shed its skillbase. This has prompted criticism from industry figures such as Goran Roos, chairman of the Advanced Manufacturing Council who says that the decision to let manufacturing slide is a mistake. “The statement from the prime minister about defence policy and industrial policy, and you can quote me on this, is completely ludicrous,” Roos says. “You can’t run a defence operation without industry. Who’s going to make your ammunition? Who’s going to repair your vehicles?” “Part of it is this erroneous idea about becoming a service economy. Two-thirds of all services that generate value are linked to manufacturing. You can see in Adelaide the link to Holden has an effect on lawyers, accountants and so on.” “[Adelaide] is just ahead of the curve.” Clean energy had offered a source of hope, as its expansion requires exactly the kind of “advanced manufacturing” the premier had been promising to bring to the state to fill the gap created by the end of Holden. Inwood, of Tindo Solar, says: “We were the fourth largest investor in renewables. In six months we’ve fallen to ninth.” He says when Warburton and his team visited Tindo’s factory, they treated it like a “box-ticking exercise”. The company’s factory sits on the outer edge of Technology Park in Mawson Lakes, about a 40-minute drive north of Adelaide. From here, Tindo builds, sells and delivers each system under a contract similar to those widely used across the US and EU. This creates an arrangement where a solar panel system is installed free, in return for a 15-year commitment from the client to buy power from the company. Inside, the place doesn’t look like much. Everything is compact. The entire production line fits into a room not much bigger than the average residential house. Every four minutes a brand new panel slides off the line. It takes 40 minutes for a panel to go from start to finish, overseen by a handful of workers in high-vis clothing who keep everything moving. “I’d been here three weeks when the [former] PM decided to open the company,” says Gavin Warwick who has worked for the company since October 2012. He smiles as he remembers being the one to show Julia Gillard the ropes. “Some of the guys thought it would be funny to throw me in the deep end to see how I went,” he says. Of the 18 jobs Warwick had applied for that month, he says, Tindo was the one he wanted the most. As a baby company in a new industry, Tindo promised exactly the kind of stability he had been looking for. And Tindo Solar has plans to expand, which would create more positions for people like Warwick. The company employs 30 people across one shift, but wants to put on a second and third shift, which would create 100 jobs. That number might have been even higher, Inwood says, had the rules of the game not changed so suddenly, forcing the company to rethink when and how it may be able to achieve its goal of cornering 20% of the Australian solar panel market. “We’re not going to go bankrupt,” Inwood says, but “this would have translated to 600 new jobs, five minutes down the road from Holden.” The fallout doesn’t stop there. Across town, Rhys Jacobs is in his office at the University of South Australia’s Sustainable Energy Centre. There, the 23-year-old PhD student is working on a project for use in the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) industry. CSP represents the other half of the solar energy industry from the photovoltaic solar cells made by Tindo. CSP works much the same way as traditional coal-fire power stations, but instead of burning coal to generate electricity, concentrated sunlight is used to heat a fluid, make steam and produce electricity. Jacob says his research project is on “encapsulated phase-change materials for use in thermal-energy storage”. In a word, batteries. Big ones. Jacob says initial design would halve the cost of storing electricity for the CSP industry, though it has yet to undergo a feasibility study. “In terms of cost, current ones go for around $30/kWh, which is horrible,” he says. “We’re aiming for $15/kWh.” Jacob is blunt about the state of the Australian renewable energy industry. “Australia’s a complete joke in renewable energy policy. We really are the worst country for renewable energy projects. We’re dead last. There will be a huge market, unless we call off the RET.” Asked whether he will move away to find work, Jacob is just as forthright. “South Australia doesn’t have a lot of the industry I’m looking at,” he says. “A lot of it is based in Sydney and Victoria. That’s where a lot of the work gets done. South Australia has a lot of experts in the field, but we’re very far behind when it comes to putting money in the project. “There’s a huge market overseas. Europe’s still fantastic at it. China, not so much. Dubai, surprisingly has a huge CSP industry. Which is very surprising that they are more up-to-date than we are.” And so long as the renewable energy industry is left to wonder about what comes next for the RET, the fear is investors will stay away, meaning the country will miss out on opportunities for growth. Inwood says this is the great tragedy behind the review. “We’ve directly put in $6m under a set of goal posts that were set in concrete,” he says. “All I’m saying is get out of our way and let us do it. Don’t change the goal posts when we’re just ramping up. “Let us grow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2014/mar/20/george-osborne-budget-kill-renewable-energy-revolution-tax-break","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-20T14:17:00Z","webTitle":"George Osborne is preparing to kill off Britain's renewable energy revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/mar/20/george-osborne-budget-kill-renewable-energy-revolution-tax-break","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2014/mar/20/george-osborne-budget-kill-renewable-energy-revolution-tax-break","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne is preparing to kill off Britain's renewable energy revolution","bodyText":"George Osborne quietly moved to kill off Britain's renewable revolution in Wednesday's budget as he stealthily enacted David Cameron's rumoured call to his cabinet to kill off the \"green crap\". With such stealth that it went almost entirely unspotted by environmentalists and journalists, who were busy focusing on his move to reduce fossil-fuel energy costs for big business, Osborne at a stroke abolished a key tax break that has attracted hundreds of millions of pounds of private money to help build Britain's green energy future. Tucked away in the budget's red book is an innocuous-looking line that Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) tax breaks will no longer be available for companies benefiting from the renewables obligation certificate (ROC) scheme or the renewable heat incentive (RHI). Of these, the ROC scheme is the big one. It underlies all the big wind, solar and other renewable technologies in the UK. The EIS tax breaks are available to investors who put money into all sorts of start-up companies. Until now that has also included firms building wind and solar farms. Now, after royal assent to the legislation in July, it will not be. One City fund manager on Wednesday predicted that many funds would simply have to hand back money to investors that they could not deploy into solar or wind projects by then. This will mean a big slowdown in the deployment of renewables in Britain, a crying shame because renewable investment and deployment have picked up sharply in recent years, after a decade of delay, as Britain finally seemed to be taking European renewable energy targets seriously. The point about the chopping and changing of support for renewables is that it creates uncertainty among investors, as countries such as Spain and Italy have found to their cost. They made retroactive changes to laws that left many investors high and dry, so they will not consider other investments there. Energy expert Dan Lewis of thinktank Future Energy Strategies puts it thus: \"No wonder some utility analysts are starting to call the UK energy sector \"uninvestable\".The paradox is that any simplification or benefit cut to Britain's deep, multi-layered and overly complex energy policy framework means that even a small adjustment has major yes or no investment implications right across the board.\" Before you decry \"subsidies\" to renewables, remember that much bigger subsidies have gone to North Sea oil and gas, coal and every other dirty fuel for decades, to say nothing of the ruinously expensive decision to build the new £16bn Hinkley Point nuclear reactor which, if built, will burden future generations with expensive electricity until nearly 2060. Renewable energy, with the exception of offshore wind power, is now cheap, getting cheaper all the time and is well below what consumers pay for their electricity. It is also much cheaper than nuclear, and safer. It soon will require no support – in many countries it has already reached \"grid parity\". This is what the economist Bjørn Lomborg, has completely failed to grasp. The systems of \"feed-in tariffs\" used by many countries, especially Germany, have built in big annual cuts, thus rapidly forcing down costs, something subsidies in the usual sense do not do. The company I run, for example, built its first solar project only four years ago, at a cost of close to €4,000 (£3,300) per kilowatt installed. We now build at about €1,000 per kW. We can produce solar power in the UK at about 8p per kW hour – not far above the wholesale price of 5p and about half the level consumers pay for their power. In sunnier countries, that 8p price can be halved. You would think, especially given how the Russian crisis has exposed the danger of being reliant on unstable regions for our energy supplies, that politicians would have woken up to the fact that producing our own energy cuts our import bill, improves our trade balance and improves our energy independence. And yet the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, is running round tearing up planning approvals for wind and solar farms. No wonder he could afford to doze off during the budget speech – he knows how effective the government's job in killing off renewables has been. These guys are being heavily lobbied by the traditional dirty and dangerous energy companies, who know full well the existential threat that renewables represent to them. They fail to realise that decentralised energy, where individuals or communities can produce their own energy, should be a natural Tory theme, not something to be feared. • Ashley Seager is a former Guardian economics correspondent and now director of solar energy firm Sun4net Ltd"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/saudi-arabia-green-construction-oil-sustainability-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-12T15:46:00Z","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia's green decree brings hopes of sustainability","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/saudi-arabia-green-construction-oil-sustainability-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/saudi-arabia-green-construction-oil-sustainability-environment","fields":{"headline":"Saudi Arabia's green decree brings hopes of sustainability","bodyText":"Happy days are here for Saudi Arabia's environmentalists. In early March, the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME) announced a decree giving all companies five years to meet new air, water and noise pollution standards. All projects must fit into Saudi's plan for international development, and must meet international benchmarks standards as part of the PME's environmental plan to protect Saudi's health and natural resources. The new regulations align with rules approved by Saudi's Council of Ministers in 2008. Given the kingdom's considerable construction projects, this is big news. A Middle East Macro Monthly report just issued by Citi Research tracks $2.5tn in construction projects that are underway in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates accounting for 60% of the work. Most is real estate community development ($450m), followed by oil and gas ($194m) and infrastructure, such as railways ($174m). Companies refusing to comply with Saudi Arabia's new standards within five years will see their projects shut down and suspended for three months, PME general manager Abdul Aziz Al-Jasser states in a news release. The new regulations are wide-reaching, addressing soil and land preservation, noise pollution from operating machinery, hazardous and radioactive waste that enters Saudi Arabia's coastal waters and other harmful pollutants. Global collaboration Secretary-general of the Saudi Green Building Forum (SGBF), Faisal Alfadl, says that the decree is \"an excellent move\" and shows a formal commitment to the SGBF's own initiatives. The SGBF oversees 170 construction projects, covering 14m square meters. Several large companies including Saudi Aramco and the Middle East's largest construction firm, the Saudi Binladin Group, are involved. The biggest megaproject, the King Abdullah Economic City, is valued at $93bn, Alfadl says. \"These will all become green building projects, help lower the region's carbon emissions and improve public safety and health.\" This month, the SGBF formally offered to help the PME meet its environmental goals. Alfadl says that their success depends on partnerships with the ministries of municipality, water and electricity. \"As Saudi Arabia grapples with constant growth, government and industry support is needed to ensure building developments adhere to USGBC Leed certifications and other global rating systems. We need national policies to ensure companies store and sort their construction waste responsibly,\" he says. \"To complete their projects, all contractors, construction companies and suppliers must adhere to these global green standards.\" Responding to the decree Experts wonder how multinational developers will respond to Saudi Arabia's new restrictions. Ioannis Ioannou, assistant professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the London Business School, suspects that the companies that are least \"green\" will incur the biggest costs and therefore will most likely exit existing projects. \"But notice that if that's the case, then the regulation achieves its goals,\" he adds. Iannou says that large global companies with developments outside of Saudi Arabia will likely have long-since adapted to the new Saudi standard, and should have no major obstacles adjusting to the decree. \"The best of companies are willing to be transparent regarding their environmental performance for their global activities,\" Ioannou says. \"Sometimes, the standards they adopt might even be more stringent than what is required by law.\" Others are more cautious. Nathan Field worked on Saudi environmental projects with a major US engineering firm from 2009 to 2011 before co-launching Industry Arabic, a translation business for the engineering and legal sectors. While Field applauds Saudi Arabia for tackling its environmental issues, he describes their problems as \"significant\". \"Saudi Arabia is a fairly new country. Therefore, its environmental standards are behind the western world, as they were in the UK and the US, 50 years ago,\" he says. While working in the kingdom, Field saw construction workers operating without any protection and waste dumped into the sea. \"Just like other rapidly developing countries, there is little societal awareness of worker safety and basic environmental solutions,\" he says. Moreover, he points out, \"Bedouin societies moving to the cities further strain resources.\" Field also sees Saudi Arabia as lacking the regulatory bodies necessary for enforcing the new regulations. \"There will be eventual, but initially slow progress and change,\" he predicts. Growing sensitivity: a good thing David Ottaway, senior scholar at the Middle East Program of the Wilson Center, a prominent US thinktank, points out that the PME decree shows that Saudi Arabia's government recognizes that environmental issues exist. He sees big environmental changes ahead for Saudi Arabia, including reserving their oil for exports versus domestic use. This would be another positive for Saudi's environment, given that oil is more polluting than gas. Saudi Arabia also has big plans for solar energy technology: in February, California-based SunEdison Inc. announced it would help establish a solar power facility complex in Saudi Arabia. However, Ottaway sees large environmental challenges ahead, such as growing commuter congestion and massive sandstorms, which could cause environmental damage to roads and buildings in and around Riyadh. \"All of this makes a five year deadline for the green decree optimistic,\" he suspects. The SGBF's Alfadl still sees big changes ahead. Among its construction projects, Saudi Arabian developers are retrofitting over 90,000 mosques in the kingdom using advanced green building techniques to reduce lighting and energy consumption by 40 to 80% and water usage by 30 to 40%. Increased electric vehicle usage will lower pollution further, he adds. \"We welcome the PME's move and we have the right support in place.\" Debbi McCullough is a writer, editor and owner of Hanging Rock Media in Cary, North Carolina The social impact hub is funded by Anglo American.

The Horizon 2020 research fund, which runs from 2014-2020, is intended to help identify potential environmental impacts and risks from shale gas exploitation by using satellite observation, developing models and establishing scientific recommendations for best practices. But the monies will go to gas companies, who would otherwise have had to pay for such research themselves, and campaigners were quick to slam the new awards for contradicting bloc policy on decarbonisation. ''The commission says that it ensures a high level of environmental protection and that it is serious about combating climate change, but at the same time it funds research for the shale gas industry. This conflict of interest cannot be ignored,'' Antoine Simon a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe told EurActiv. “It's particularly cynical as it involves handing out public money to an industry dominated by some of the richest companies in the world where there are many more important energy efficiency and renewable energy research priorities,” he added. The EU’s research and innovation directorate would not reveal which companies had applied for revenues, but said that a €33m pot had been set aside for funding awards this year. “Of the initial 23 eligible applications, seven will be invited to submit final proposals by the call deadline of 23 September,” an official said. “We cannot say yet how many projects will be retained, nor who is asking for money because it is a competitive tender.” While the commission would prefer to limit the awards to €3m each, it will consider requests for higher amounts, the official added. A European council decision last December allowed Horizon 2020 funding to be given to unconventional gas and oil resource exploration and production where this was considered appropriate. The funding call was published a few days later. Shale gas was deemed to be low carbon in the programme because it “may help in the transition towards a low-carbon economy provided its air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, are adequately mitigated,” an EU official said. The new funding might help to do this, he implied. But a report by the UK government’s chief scientific adviser David MacKay last year concluded that carbon emissions from shale gas were similar to those from liquefied natural gas imports from Qatar. It found that \"the principal effect of UK shale gas production and use will be that it displaces imported LNG, or possibly piped gas from outside Europe. The net effect on total UK [greenhouse gas] emissions rates is likely to be small.\" While lifecycle CO2 emissions from gas are roughly half as much as from coal or oil, they are still exponentially more than from renewable energies such as wind and solar energy, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Marcus Pepperell, a spokesman for Shale Gas Europe pointed out that IPCC reports had also identified unconventional gas as a potential bridging fuel on the way to a renewables-based power system. “Europe is facing particular energy security issues and yet we have no commercial shale gas operations in Europe,” he told EurActiv. “It is logical that the commission should look at all opportunities to diversify Europe’s energy mix.” “Given the significant amounts of investments we are looking at in other energy sources such as renewables, it is appropriate to see where Europe can help develop a shale gas industry within an environmentally sustainable framework,” he said. Isaac Valero, the spokesman for the EU’s climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said shale could be a bridge towards renewables and energy efficiency, “but shale gas alone will not solve the climate problem\", he cautioned. Hedegaard has previously called for European development banks to take a lead in eliminating public support for fossil fuels. Key to the debate over the potential contribution that gas can make to tackling climate change, is the question of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a shorter 100-year period, and 72 times greater over 20 years. Scientists believe that it could be a particularly dangerous trigger for global warming feedback loops. When methane emissions were considered, a 2011 Cornell University study by Professor Robert Howarth found that the climate-warming impacts of shale gas could be between 20% and 100% worse than coal. Other reports though have been less alarming. Once the hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) of shale gas wells has been completed, large amounts of methane gas flow to the surface, along with chemicals used in the fracking fluid. There, they may be either vented into the atmosphere, burned and so converted to carbon dioxide, or captured and sold to markets under ‘green completion’ techniques. Speaking to EurActiv last year, Howarth said that green completion was “the best [method] environmentally, although some methane is still probably released during the operation. But it has not been commonly done in the US. It takes time, and companies would rather push ahead as fast as they can and move on to develop and frack another well.” US Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to make these techniques mandatory – with some exceptions – by 2015, would depend on industry reporting of methane emissions rather than inspections, and so could be ‘gamed’ he feared. European firms will also be required to self-monitor their methane emissions under proposed new EU guidelines, which could be made binding in 2015. But “venting is invisible to the naked eye,” Howarth said. “Unwatched rigs seem likely to cheat at least some times, given the history of the US oil and gas industry in complying with regulations in the past. Industry will have to provide information in Europe, perhaps, but how will anyone know if the information is accurate? Industry certainly has a very strong interest in trying to project that methane emissions are low.” The gas industry counters that shale drills in Europe could already be covered by legislation such as the Mining Waste Directive and Water framework Directive. \"We don’t believe there is a need for specific new rules on shale gas but if legislative gaps are identified we are happy to analyse the situation and co-operate with policy makers on finding the best way forward,” said Alessandro Torello, a spokesman for the International Association of Oil and Gas producers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-06T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Is humour the best weapon against Europe’s new wave of far-right nationalism? | Holly Case and John Palattella","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban","fields":{"headline":"Is humour the best weapon against Europe’s new wave of xenophobic nationalism?","bodyText":"Gergely Kovács never wanted to get involved in politics. “I prefer to mess around,” he told a news magazine in his native Hungary last year, “not stand up for something.” Since 2000, Kovács has been leader of a group of prankster artists now known as the Two-Tailed Dog party. One of the group’s stunts a few years ago involved spray-painting a wall with a graffiti image of someone writing – in graffiti – the longest Hungarian word (megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért) and running out of room after spelling just 32 of its 44 characters. Not long after, the group built a “spaceship station” on the banks of the Tisza river advertising daily departures to four destinations: Sirius, the moon, the Ganymede and Pluto. But last summer, when the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s rightwing government introduced a series of xenophobic measures to repel the tens of thousands of migrants and refugees passing through Hungary on their way to Germany, Denmark and Sweden, Kovács and the Two-Tailed Dog got serious. “It really made us angry that the government uses the people’s money for a campaign that tells them who to hate,” Kovács fumed. “Here in Hungary we already hate each other enough.” A quarter of a century ago, as an idealistic young politician, Orbán wanted to break down walls and open up possibilities. But lately, he has focused his energies on shutting down alternatives. Since winning the 2010 parliamentary election, his governing party, Fidesz, have carried out a well-orchestrated constitutional coup that has centralised political authority, tamed the judiciary and denied opposition parties control of state institutions. Orbán has even built new walls along Hungary’s borders, in order to keep migrants out. In late April, Fidesz introduced a so-called national consultation on immigration and terrorism. Questionnaires were mailed to millions of Hungarians in May, accompanied by a letter in which the prime minister asserted that migrants crossing into Europe through Hungary claimed to be refugees, but their real aim was to siphon off welfare and jobs from Hungarians. The survey contained 12 leading questions, such as: “Do you agree with the Hungarian government that instead of immigrants, it is rather Hungarian families and soon-to-be-born children who need support?” The Two-Tailed Dog parried with a mock questionnaire of its own. “I was sitting at home alone and it came to me,” Kovács recalled. He posted the survey – with a customary, if unintentional, sprinkling of typos – on the party’s Facebook page on the afternoon of 2 May, and it quickly went viral. Sample question: “There are those who blame the freemasons, others who blame the Jews or the space aliens. In your view who is responsible for the fact that the national debt remains high?” Possible answers: “The Jews”, “The space aliens”, “The fucking Jewish space aliens!” The estimated cost of the government’s national consultation was 1bn forints (£2.4m), approximately double the amount the government had spent on processing refugees. (Most of the funding for refugees in Hungary came from the European Union.) Two days after Kovács posted his questionnaire, the bombastic president of the European Commission, Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, greeted Orbán at an EU summit with a raised hand as “Dictator!” and slapped him playfully on the face. The Orbán government’s next move was to plaster Hungarian cities and towns with hundreds of anti-immigrant billboards. “If you come to Hungary, you may not take jobs away from Hungarians,” one insisted. Another read, “If you come to Hungary, you must respect our culture.” Then came the announcement that, in order to deter migrants and refugees, the government would build a fence to seal off the border with Serbia, which is not a member of the EU. Some of the government’s billboards were painted over in protest within hours. Soon, the Two-Tailed Dog and affiliated malcontents launched a two-pronged counterattack. The party lampooned Orbán’s plan for a border fence: “Of course, we Hungarians loved that Iron Curtain, we miss it very much, people have been expressing their strong demand for building a similar curtain for years now.” As opposed to the 175km-long, 4m-wide wall planned by the government, however, why not one 175km tall and 4m wide? “The tourists would love it!” At the same time, the Two-Tailed Dog, together with an alternative news blog called Vastagbőr (Thick Skin), launched a campaign to raise 3m forints (roughly £7,000) to buy space on 50 billboards for one month. The idea was to blanket the country with slogans satirising the government’s xenophobic billboards. “We know it’s a lot of money,” read the call for donations, but “the Fidesz hate campaign has become so degenerate that we must do something extraordinary to counter it.” The campaign struck a chord, raising the 3m forints in seven hours. Two weeks later, the coalition had received more than 33m forints (£76,000) in donations. It was enough for 900 billboards – as many as the government had posted – with 1.5m forints (around £3,500) to spare. In a press statement, a pro-government NGO suggested that there was no way that a “pseudo-NGO” with “two tails” could legitimately take in so much money for its “pseudo-solidarity stunts”, and implied that the funds were “lackey money” from “foreign sources”. Kovács admits there is something to these allegations, given that, of the 7,000 people who sent donations for the campaign, “at least a thousand were sent from abroad”. However, he points out that these were from Hungarians abroad, “which is not that surprising given that half the country now lives in western Europe”. The counter-billboards started to appear in July. “If you are Hungary’s prime minister, you have to obey our laws,” one declared, while another, erected in Orbán’s hometown of Felcsút, cited the Hungarian law that forbids hateful agitation against members of any “national, ethnic, racial, or religious group”. The campaign also played on the fact that it is not just “foreigners” who go abroad to work, but Hungarians as well. “Come to Hungary by all means,” one billboard read, “we’re already working in London!” “I hate spending other people’s money,” Kovács said in August, referring to the unexpected and overwhelming success of the fundraising campaign. “I have no trouble spending my own money, but this is different.” Along with the slew of donations, the party had been relying on the goodwill of hundreds of volunteers, young and old. “We have lots of people who want to do something. And we should figure out how they could help us and Hungary.” The Two-Tailed Dog may not be a real political alternative to Fidesz, but by offering a view of the world that diverges sharply from the government’s, it has thrust a defiant paw in the closing door of possibility and dared the powers that be to kick it aside. So far the government’s strategy has broadly been to ignore the group. When asked in early September what he thought of the Two-Tailed Dog party, György Schöpflin, Fidesz’s representative in the EU parliament, hesitated before saying, “I never really looked at what they do or what they stand for. I don’t think it’s a serious political party.” He’s right. It isn’t. And that’s precisely the point. The Two-Tailed Dog, says the Hungarian historian István Rév, “is a refreshing group in a rightly depressed country that has lost its sense of humour”. A well-placed observer of Hungarian politics who wishes to remain anonymous says that since 2010, protests against Orbán “have been either too small or too homogeneous. But a joke party could raise 33m forints for joke billboards. I have mixed emotions. I keep my fingers crossed for them. For us all.” * * * Late one night in mid-September, Kovács convened a brainstorming session at his sparsely furnished house in a leafy suburb of Budapest to discuss the Two-Tailed Dog’s next action. Kovács, who is 35, has an infectiously mischievous smile and dresses like a college student, in faded blue jeans, loose-fitting T-shirts, and scruffy white sneakers. He sat at a table on the terrace, which looked out onto the starlit city, and opened a beer. With him were three others: Ferenc Sebő, a creator of anarchist theatricals, and two longstanding associates from the party’s early days, Tibor Árki, a graphic designer, and Zsolt Victora, an art dealer. They were gathered around a copy of the Magyar Hírlap, or the Hungarian Gazette, a populist broadsheet owned by a conservative oligarch. The paper is one of two dailies close to the government: government offices subscribe to the paper, and it receives outsized advertising revenue from the state. Not surprisingly, the Magyar Hírlap faithfully backed Orbán’s vilification of refugees and migrants. Since last summer, it has offered a daily dose of siege mentality with headlines such as “The migrants have become more aggressive”, “All of Europe is threatened with an explosion”, and “The immigrants have initiated a coup against our homeland’s legal order”. “If you read the Magyar Hírlap,” explained Árki from beneath a Rasta-style knit cap pulled down over his ears, “you’ll see that good humour is gone, and what we have now is terror-media.” Kovács and Sebő studied the broadsheet as Árki spoke and gazed into the night. Sebő jabbed at several pages with a pen, dissecting articles and bursting into belly laughs. Kovács sat with his legs crossed and listened intently, occasionally flashing a grin. After a while Sebő began taking photos of the front page with his phone and darted inside; a few minutes later he returned clutching a handful of printouts that he arranged on the table. He and Kovács began writing alternative headlines and illustrations on them. Árki peered from beneath his cap and floated wry advice from across the table. A plan was taking shape: to publish and distribute a fake edition of the Magyar Hírlap, one that would swap its vitriol for hilarity, and bad news for good. In its tone and message, the Two-Tailed Dog trots along the path of great central European satirists such as the Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek, author of the comic novel The Good Soldier Švejk (1923). In 1911, Hašek founded the PFGFIDSDG, The Party of Incremental Progress within the Limits of the Law, which promised to reintroduce slavery and the Inquisition. Will the Two-Tailed Dog prove to be more transformative than its absurdist predecessors? They clearly want to be, but a lot depends on whether levity can fuel meaningful action. Kovács and his colleagues will have to overcome the sharp antagonisms between Hungarians that they see as Orbán’s handiwork. “Fidesz tries to gain popularity from low social solidarity,” Kovács says. The government’s anti-immigrant billboards were all in Hungarian, making it extremely unlikely that any migrant or asylum seeker could understand them, and suggesting that Orbán is more concerned with attacking his political opponents within Hungary than blocking a perceived threat from the outside. The problem of internal division cuts very close to home for the group’s members. Kovács’s father is a Fidesz supporter, so discussion of politics is off-limits at family gatherings. On Facebook, leaders of the Two-Tailed Dog have seen many acquaintances fall victim to the intensifying factionalisation. Sebő says that during the peak of the government’s national consultation and the migrant crisis last summer, “Everyone’s bundle of friends was reduced by half.” The Two-Tailed Dog wants to offer an alternative to perpetual antagonism. For Sebő, the group is a gate through which anyone can enter. Suzi Dada, a longstanding member of the group, agrees, saying that the party’s message should be one of “neither hatred nor despair, towards which people are all too inclined here. Instead we should know how to laugh at something together. Then a solution becomes possible.” As the conversation about the Magyar Hírlap wound down, Kovács returned to the kitchen for another round of beers. Victora walked to the garden, where dinner was cooking on a grill. He set down paper plates stacked high with meat on a table covered in plates of sliced tomatoes and onions, bread, and ashtrays overflowing with the butt-ends of hand-rolled cigarettes and spent ash from a marijuana bowl. Two dogs, one tail each, scrambled between the legs of the table and the party members. As they ate, the group discussed tactics. They calculated that the owners of the Magyar Hírlap would waste no time in suing them, so they planned to set aside most of the remaining funds from the counter-billboard campaign for a lawsuit, leaving the rest for printing costs. With the finances settled, they began hashing out the paper’s editorial vision: Orbán had used attacks on migrants and refugees to orchestrate a clash with the European Union and Hungarians who rejected his illiberal politics. The Two-Tailed Dog’s edition of the Magyar Hírlap should not only make a mockery of its politics, Árki insisted, but also imagine a better world. “Wouldn’t it be great if things were this way. Why aren’t they?” * * * In another district not far from Kovács’s house is a student dormitory shaded by trees. Unlike at the headquarters of the Two-Tailed Dog, the bell on the gate works. The rooms and public areas are airy and bright. In one of them, a young Viktor Orbán, together with a roommate and a few other friends, founded a political party in 1988. They called themselves Fidesz – the Young Democrats – and they, too, were trying to imagine a better world. Back then Fidesz was broadly liberal, a fuzzy term in a country where the political spectrum was basically confined to a single socialist party. To be liberal in Hungary meant being against communism and in favour of democratic pluralism and the rule of law. Though no one knew it at the time, the end of socialist Hungary was near. János Kádár, the leader of Hungary and its Communist party since 1956, was growing old, and the reputation of the man whose legacy Kádár had long sought to bury – Imre Nagy, the leader of the country’s short-lived 1956 revolution – was rising up again. On 16 June 1989, the 31st anniversary of Nagy’s execution by the Soviet Union, over 100,000 people attended the ceremonial reburial of his remains in Budapest. After some debate, a conciliatory socialist party seeking to distance itself from Kádár granted Fidesz a role in the ceremony. Orbán, barely 26 at the time, was given the microphone. With his perpetual three-day beard, near-mullet, ramrod posture, and aura of seriousness, he cut a striking figure. He also came across as a natural leader. “If we believe in our own strength, then we are capable of bringing an end to the communist dictatorship,” he told the crowd, who were astonished to hear such blunt oppositional language uttered in public. Three weeks later, the foreign ministers of Austria and Hungary oversaw the dismantling of a section of the razor wire fence between the two states. In the free elections of 1990, Fidesz won 9% of the vote and Orbán became an MP. Within a few years he was pulling the party harder to the centre-right, driving many early enthusiasts from its ranks. In March 1994, he told a Hungarian magazine, “I’d rather use ‘free-thinking’ in place of the word ‘liberal’, because in the countryside they don’t have a clue what I’m talking about if I say ‘liberal’.” After Fidesz lost ground to the socialists in that year’s parliamentary elections, Orbán was able to make the case that the party should lean still harder to the right. He thus became the sole face of Fidesz as the last of the party’s left-leaning membership quit its ranks. The young leader bid them good riddance. In 1998, Orbán’s anger and resentment towards an out-of-touch political and social elite won Hungarians over at the polls. Fidesz formed a coalition with two small parties, and Orbán became prime minister. For the duration of his four-year term he used his position to strengthen the office of the prime minister and centralise the state apparatus. (He also promised that his government would “replace the separation of church and state with an emphasis on the cooperation of church and state”.) But it was not until his second spell in office, in 2010, that Orbán managed to initiate the total transformation he had presaged more than two decades earlier. The 2008 financial crisis hit many Hungarians hard, leaving many struggling and disillusioned. Within a few years, thousands of young Hungarians were leaving the country to seek work and opportunities elsewhere. Meanwhile, the governing socialist party’s legitimacy sunk to an all-time low following a leaked recording of prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány recounting how the party had lied repeatedly about the country’s fiscal status and potential. His goal as prime minister, Gyurcsány continued, had been to give the left back its dignity, “so that it wouldn’t have to shit its pants at the sight of Viktor Orbán and the right wing.” After the leak the socialist party all but collapsed. Running without any meaningful opposition from the left, Fidesz won an absolute majority in the 2010 elections and proceeded to rewrite the Hungarian constitution. The new document consolidated Orbán’s hold over the state, from the highest to the very lowest levels of its administration and courts. And many stood behind him. One of Orbán’s first acts as prime minister was to pass a law offering relief to Hungarians with bad mortgages held in Swiss francs; another was to stack the judiciary with Fidesz supporters and effectively block opposition to his party’s policies. His alteration of a labour law enabled the government to purge opposition supporters from the state sector. But he wasn’t finished. Orbán declared that Hungary would join China, India, Turkey and Russia in the “race to invent a state that is most capable of making a nation successful”. If European unification had made liberal democracy the expected norm, Hungary would enter a new realm of possibility by pioneering “illiberal democracy” as its creed and closing the door on alternatives. * * * As Orbán was serving his first term as prime minister, a small beast with two tails was born in a provincial university town in southern Hungary called Szeged. Around the turn of the millennium Szeged was a hub for students with edgy talents and aspirations – in extreme sports, graffiti, street art, skateboarding – who were looking for creative outlets. Among them was a young student who called herself Suzi Dada. It was at university in Szeged, she says, that she first met others who thought like her. “My family situation was something of a mess, so I couldn’t count on the support of my parents and had a lot of independence and responsibility,” she said. Dada met Kovács “by chance” shortly after arriving in Szeged in 2001, when both were looking for flatmates. Their shared apartment became a gathering place for students planning street art interventions and other stunts. “Ideas came from all different directions, and we had such fun,” Dada recalled. Meanwhile she studied history, and Kovács started degree programmes in a variety of disciplines (mainly sociology and computer programming), never to complete any of them. There were brushes with the authorities, such as when the group created a series of mock ads for the Hungarian railways (“Our trains are deliberately delayed” and “We go out of our way not to clean the trains”) that failed to amuse their target. On another occasion, the police caught Kovács spray-painting “For Sale” on a public rubbish bin. The officers agreed not to report him so long as he allowed them to spray-paint “For Sale” on his stomach. “It seemed like a good deal to me,” Kovács said. Like all scrappy mongrels, the Two-Tailed Dog has no verifiable birthdate and no precisely defined identity. One day an economics student in Kovács and Dada’s circle of friends drew a dog with two tails and that became the group’s logo. The “oldest” members who are still active in the group are Dada, Árki, Victora and Kovács. All have faded in and out of active participation over the years, but Kovács has always been the undisputed leader. Kovács will happily sound out the other members, but he has the last word on what goes public with the party’s logo. “There’s no democracy,” Dada laughed when asked about the group’s inner workings. “Without him there would be no Two-Tailed Dog.” Initially, the true identity of the Two-Tailed Dog was shrouded in mystery. “After a while everyone started to ask around the university, ‘Who is the guy?’” recalled Csaba Tibor Tóth, a former student. When an undergraduate group at the university invited Kovács to speak in 2009, he agreed, but never showed up. Meanwhile, the city watched as words and images of distress and anomie began to adorn Szeged’s pavements, drainpipes, billboards, walls, house fronts and trees, courtesy of the Two-Tailed Dog: graffiti factories belching smoke; tear-off ads saying “I’ll be over at your place in a bit to hit you up for a cigarette”; a graffiti animal with a jackhammer chipping away at a building’s scarred façade; a sign for a lost dog in which the dog is seen from a great distance and identifiable only as a small black dot. The group called itself a party long before it successfully registered as one. In 2006 it ran a slate of candidates, all two-tailed dogs wearing neckties and all bearing the name István Nagy (the Hungarian version of John Smith). The party programme promised eternal life, free beer, lower taxes and the construction of a mountain in pancake-flat Szeged. During the fateful 2010 elections, in which Orbán finally won his supermajority, the Two-Tailed Dog logo appeared with a necktie on a series of unconventional campaign posters: “We’ll introduce the Euro in 2005!” “More everything, less nothing!” “Are you tired of people? Give another species a chance. Vote for the Two-Tailed Dog.” In Budapest, the party promised to introduce new express metro lines “that don’t stop anywhere”. Although the Two-Tailed Dog ridiculed Orbán’s government, the two parties converge on some issues. Like Orbán, the Two-Tailed Dog is critical of multinational corporations – Orbán because they aren’t Hungarian, the Two-Tailed Dog because they serve a culture of consumption. Like Orbán, the Two-Tailed Dog has drawn attention to the souring of the atmosphere of possibility that existed in the years just after the collapse of state socialism, and has disparaged Hungary’s inferiority complex towards western Europe and the creep of market ideology into every endeavour. An early billboard by the Two-Tailed Dog showed the prows of three sculls marked Oxford, Cambridge and, trailing noticeably behind, Hungarian Universities. “How can we catch up in higher education?” asked the billboard. Answer: “Oooh, let’s charge [higher] tuition!” The punchline’s air of cynical desperation was very much of its time. In the early 2000s, young Hungarians saw their prospects at home vanishing, and many – including Kovács and Dada – extended their university studies for up to a decade, while others sought opportunities elsewhere in Europe, a trend that has continued unabated. Now around 5% of Hungarian citizens live and work abroad. György Schöpflin, who has spent most of his life and career in Britain, recently described a “good Hungarian” as someone who stays in the country and works. (The government has turned this admonition into policy. Sebő’s girlfriend is a second-year student at university, and in order to receive tuition relief for her studies, she was recently required to sign a contract stipulating that she may not leave Hungary for a set number of years after she graduates.) If a “good Hungarian” is someone who stays at home and works, then the leadership of the Two-Tailed Dog party is comprised of excellent Hungarians. Though most of them have left Szeged for Budapest, all of the core party members – plus Sebő, who is not a party member as he doesn’t join parties on principle, but is very active in the group’s activities – live and work in Hungary, even as many of their friends and siblings have moved to Austria, Germany and the UK. “I stayed because of my friends,” says Kovács. “I have 10 or 15 really good friends and that’s what I’d miss if I went abroad. I don’t necessarily like just anyone.” * * * Although the Two-Tailed Dog started life far from mainstream Hungarian politics, with the counter-billboard campaign the party became much more politically active. In July, after an initial rejection from a municipal court on the grounds that it was “frivolous”, the Two-Tailed Dog party was finally cleared for registration as an official Hungarian political party. “We joke around much more seriously now,” said Dada. Kovács concedes that the time has come to get serious, but not to become serious: “I am convinced that we are much more effective as pranksters.” After the success of the counter-billboard campaign, the Two-Tailed Dog contemplated organising a “fence-tival” on either side of Orbán’s new border fence with Serbia. There would be a DJ, and volleyball matches using the fence as a net. An opposition party was on board, but Kovács grew skittish when the government created a 60m no-man’s-land on either side of the fence: “If the volleyball falls in that zone, we’ll never be able to get it out.” More important, having a party while thousands of migrants and refugees were scrambling for their lives across the border didn’t seem right: “I don’t want to joke about that,” said Kovács. “It’s dreadful.” The plan was cancelled. (The fence was completed in September, and a second fence on the Croatian border was finished in October.) One evening in late October, the Two-Tailed Dog held a meeting in Budapest to enlist volunteer activists to help it organise a new “secret action”. The meeting took place on the third floor of a building on the Blaha Lujza square, historically a rough area of the city. The building was one of Budapest’s first department stores. Today its first and second floors are filled with dingy shops stocking poor-quality clothing and household goods. The third floor is “one of the last free spaces” in Hungary, according to Sebő. It is home to a bar and some open areas with tables and chairs. About 50 people had gathered for the 7pm meeting. When Kovács arrived, about 10 minutes late, he announced that the proceedings would begin at 7.30pm since “no real follower of the Two-Tailed Dog would show up before then”. He then took up a seat off to one side. Sebő, Árki, Dada (with her hair done up in two tails) and other members of the party were in attendance, but scattered among the crowd. After a back-and-forth over whether people should introduce themselves, introductions began, but in a characteristically satirical vein: “I’m Lajos, and I came because I have time.” “I’m Géza, and I’m here because I don’t have time.” Kovács explained that the “secret action” was the distribution of the spoof edition of the Magyar Hírlap, 10,000 copies of which were sitting in his house. Several months earlier, Orbán had insisted that Hungary should be a “country where not anything can happen”. Blending comedy and idealism, the spoof edition went in the opposite direction. The front-page headlines set the tone for the entire issue. One announced that the planned construction of a controversial nuclear plant had been halted and that “solar energy will be the new priority”; the accompanying article “cited” Orbán as saying, “Our children’s future is the most important thing.” The paper divulged the winning lottery numbers for the following week, gave a weather forecast based on readers’ suggestions, and reported that the banks of the Danube would be converted back into a pedestrian zone and car traffic rerouted underground. A dispatch on the “refugee crisis” reported that Orbán had spent the night in a camp on the Croatian border along with his wife and three children. Quoting the prime minister: “It was an eye-opening night, and I was forced to acknowledge that these people are in no way different from us, except that they were forced to flee a country that had been torn apart by religious conflict and senseless terror.” In regional coverage, readers learned that Turkey had agreed to pay reparations for its 150-year occupation of Hungary during the Ottoman era, that the European Union was financing the construction of a black hole in Orbán’s hometown of Felcsút, and that “more than four people” had repatriated their jobs from western Europe as part of the successful “Bring home your jobs!” campaign. On the world stage, anonymous donors had paid off Greece’s national debt and Mark Zuckerberg purchased Hungarian citizenship. A luxury watch ad on page 5 showed a horse wearing a gold watch on each leg: “Gold watches. For horses. From Belgium.” On 30 October, the paper was distributed in Budapest, Szeged, and a few other cities where party activists live. Dada and Sebő were up at an uncharacteristically early hour. “It was supposed to be at 7am, but I was a little late,” said Sebő, “so it was more like 8am, but I was there.” The papers were handed out on the street and outside subway stops. One person approached Dada and said, “This is great! If only it were true …” Another man took a copy, went away and returned with a sparkle in his eyes. “He nearly threw himself around my neck for joy,” Dada said. Gábor Széles, the owner of the genuine Magyar Hírlap, was less amused. Within hours of the appearance of the spoof edition the publisher of the paper vowed to take legal action against the Two-Tailed Dog. The publisher’s statement read: “It is the view of the Magyar Hírlap Publishers Inc that this behaviour is illegal, and damaging not only to the publisher and the editorial staff, but also to the trusting readers.” The statement then raised the spectre, quite common in Hungarian politics, of foreign financial support, suggesting that there was no way a tiny, recently founded party “with no real public support” could have the resources required to produce a paper of 10,000 copies. (When asked about the legal action, the publisher claimed it was the editor-in-chief’s responsibility, and the editor, Péter Petán, through his secretary passed us to the domestic news desk, which passed us back to the editor-in-chief, who would not speak to us. Our request to speak to Széles was denied.) So far Kovács has not been contacted in connection with any legal action. Dada had her doubts about the publisher’s threat. She explained that in the past a car manufacturer had considered pressing charges against the party for satirising one of its adverts, but in the end thought better of it because the company’s prestige would be harmed if it attacked a tiny group of pranksters. “It’s like kicking a small, cute dog,” said Sebő. But the dog is bracing for a fight, if it comes to that. “We have good lawyers,” said Kovács. Two days after the spoof of the Magyar Hírlap was circulated, a post on the Two-Tailed Dog’s “Government Organisation” Facebook page suggested the party had returned to politics as usual: “Finally we’re doing nothing again and can post senseless sillinesser [sic!] at night drunkenly.” Hungarian politics, too, continued as normal. In the wake of the 13 November terror attacks in Paris, the Magyar Hírlap took to gloating, and praised Orbán’s efforts to keep refugees out of Hungary. “A mandatory quota would merely spread terrorism,” screamed the front-page headline, quoting a remark the prime minister made on 17 November. At a time when Hungarian anxieties about migration and Islam remain high, and other EU politicians have come around to Orbán’s views on migrants, the Two-Tailed Dog’s members are trying to survive without losing their levity, or their nerve. They’re planning to put out their own monthly newspaper soon. “We’ll have to start building up our regional bases in the larger cities if we want to win in 2018,” Kovács joked, referring to the next Hungarian parliamentary elections. As for Sebő, following the successful execution of the “secret action”, he was staying up late, getting high and agonising over a musical he was working on with another playwright. Although the piece was not yet fully written, the rehearsals had already begun. “One shouldn’t work like this,” he said, leafing through the pages of dialogue. The play is about a man named Ignác, AKA “Uncle Nácy” (pronounced “Nazi”) who builds a submarine in order to plant a Hungarian flag on the north pole. Ignác has a little dog named Dolfi who is supposed to plant the flag. Nácy the musical is scheduled to open on 8 January in Budapest. When we last spoke with Sebő, he and his co-author had not yet decided how the piece should end. “The details of the dog’s fate have yet to be determined,” Sebő confided nervously. They had a couple of ideas. One was that Dolfi is roasted and eaten by the crew, all of whom grow increasingly hungry as the journey becomes ever more desperate and conflict-ridden. Another ending is that the dog takes control of the ship. “It’s so hard to know what will happen,” said Sebő. “Right now anything is possible.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/unquenchable-thirst-expanding-coal-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-01T16:30:50Z","webTitle":"The unquenchable thirst of an expanding coal industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/unquenchable-thirst-expanding-coal-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/unquenchable-thirst-expanding-coal-industry","fields":{"headline":"The unquenchable thirst of an expanding coal industry","bodyText":"An oasis is a body of water, ringed by greenery and beyond that, a lifeless, endless landscape that coughs up dust and sand whenever the wind touches it. It is a globally understood symbol of something precious, fragile and rare. The entire population of the planet: plants, animals and people, are crowded around that symbolic single, lonely body of water. All of us jostling and pushing to get our share. Some are close to the source through sheer luck, others have muscled their way in. This has left those without fiscal or political clout on the fringes, unable to get near fresh water for sanitation, agriculture or even to drink. The coal industry is one of the groups which has managed to muscle its way in. This year, as policymakers work towards a fresh set of universal sustainable development goals, water-efficiency and clean energy will be on the table. This is an important opportunity to establish an integrated water-energy target – a way to put a cap on how much water coal power is able to use. As it stands, coal plants use an incredible amount of water for their operation; electricity is made by burning coal to convert water into high-pressure steam to drive turbines; water is used to cool the steam so it can go back to the boiler again. Water is also needed to wash and process coal before it is burned, to wash coal ash out, to reduce dust levels of the coal stockpile and to extinguish fires. A typical coal plant uses enough water to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every three and a half minutes. To put it in global terms, that is about 8% of our total global water demand. What it doesn't consume it spits out as millions of tons of pollutants into our fresh-water rivers, lakes and streams. We are seeing the effects of this in the US, where a coal slurry spill left 300,000 West Virginians without safe drinking water. In addition, acidic water drainage from old mines can make entire water supplies unfit for people, decades after closure. With more than 1200 new coal plants proposed around the world – and much of the coal expansion in places such as China, India, and Russia where, together, 63% of the population is already suffering from water scarcity – a reckoning must be made in terms of how sensible it is for the coal industry to continue. At the same time, coal burning is a major contributor to climate change, which in itself will further dry up our shallow water supply. Strong evidence is also emerging that large-scale energy-water conflicts are already unfolding: in China, a coal chemical project in the dry Inner Mongolia region – part of a new mega-coal power base – has used so much water in eight years of operation that according to interviews with local residents, the local water table may have dropped by up to 100 metres, and the local lake to shrink by 62%. In South Africa, 1.63 million people don't have access to a basic level of water supply. Against this water scarcity the main utility company, Eskom, argues that their coal plants should be exempt from minimum emissions standards because there isn't enough water to operate their scrubbers – the machinery that \"controls\" polluting exhaust. The excess emissions of acid rain and smog-generating pollutants from their coal fleet, such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury, are projected to cause approximately 20,000 premature deaths, according to Greenpeace research. In India, the energy-water conflict is even starker. According to analysis by HSBC and the World Resources Institute, a staggering 79% of new energy capacity will be built in areas that are already lacking water. Yet, coal is still the energy of choice despite the risk to the lives and livelihoods of local populations. Countries such as Turkey, and others in south-east Asia, which are banking on large coal expansion, should learn from these unfolding coal water conflicts. Energy-water conflicts are avoidable. With energy, we have a choice. Unlike coal, wind and solar energy consumes little water and according to studies may be the most water-efficient form of generating electricity. Responding to climate change and avoiding water security threats hinges on the decisions policy and business leaders make today. As we watch our precious desert reservoir become more polluted and shallow, now is the time to limit the greedy water consumption by the coal industry by shifting to more water-efficient, renewable energies everywhere. This will make the difference between 2°C and 4°C global warming. It will also halt the current unsustainable growth that continues to push billions into the fringes of our oasis.

They will do so under the auspices of the UN framework convention on climate change. This is an international treaty negotiated at the Earth summit in Rio in 1992 with the objective to “stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system”. The discussions in Paris in 2015 will be informed by the latest climate science. In our play 2071, which recently completed its inaugural run at the Royal Court theatre in London, directed by Katie Mitchell, we explore the science, its implications and the options before us. A key aim is to leave the audience better placed to participate in the public discourse, in which we all need to play a part. Climate change is a controversial subject that can raise strong emotions. We are all susceptible to being less open-minded and rational about it than we may appreciate. The climate system is very complex, yet its discussion is often oversimplified. There are gaps in our knowledge, and many scientific uncertainties, some of which are fundamentally unknowable. This makes it extremely difficult to predict precisely what the future holds and to determine exactly what actions, if any, to take. In addition there are economic considerations, political implications and ethical questions that further complicate the way forward. In 2071 we describe how satellites allow us to probe and map our planet’s key components – atmosphere, oceans, ice, and land – in unprecedented ways. By using computer models to bring together the space data with a myriad measurements made in situ, and by combining these with our understanding of underlying physical laws, it is possible to begin to make sense of what is observed. This provides a grand perspective of the Earth’s system as a whole, of its component parts and the interconnections between them. The system behaves in complex and often counterintuitive ways. But the fundamental principles of it are quite simple: its component parts interact with each other such that, over time, the amount of energy leaving the planet is equal to the amount entering it from the Sun. The interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the ice on land and sea drive the natural variability of the climate. The system is very responsive. Even a small change in one component can trigger a chain of consequences in the other parts. When such changes alter the energy balance, the effects are felt throughout the entire system, while it adjusts to reach a new balance. Changing oceans Since the majority of inbound solar energy is absorbed by the oceans, which cover 70% of the planet’s surface and are dark, any imbalance should be most readily observable there. Sea levels rise as water temperature increases, acting as a global thermometer. By combining data gleaned from beach structures and archaeological data, we know that during the latter part of the Holocene, the unusually stable climatic period the planet has undergone since the end of the last Ice Age, sea-level changes did not exceed 0.2mm per year. Information from tide gauges, and more recently, satellite radars, show that in the late 19th century, sea levels began to rise. Over the 20th century the rate of rise averaged 1.8mm per year. Over the last two decades, the rate has further increased to 3.3mm per year. This may not seem much, but it is geologically significant. The current rate is approaching the 10mm per year which occurred during the transition from the last Ice Age to the current warm interglacial, a major climatic shift. And it is occurring during the warm interglacial, at a time unrelated to the natural ice age cycle. In 1978 John Mercer, a US glaciologist, described how, in a warming world, a successive collapse of ice shelves extending down the Antarctic Peninsula might occur. He suggested that this would be a warning sign of a more significant sequence of events to come. The Antarctic Peninsula connects to an area of the Antarctic called West Antarctica, where the massive ice sheet sits on bedrock that is up to 2km below sea level. Mercer’s concern was that if the successive collapse reached this far, the pressure of the warmer water at depth would lift the ice sheet, causing water to penetrate deeper and deeper below the ice, reducing friction between the ice and rock, leading to an unstoppable collapse. This would result in a rise in sea levels over time of many metres, as the total volume of ice in West Antarctica is equivalent to a six-metre rise. Since the 1990s, a successive series of ice shelf collapses has occurred along the peninsula, and parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are now accelerating into the ocean. And in the northern hemisphere, the satellite and surface data show that the loss of ice from the Greenland ice sheet increased by 600% over a decade following the 1990s. It is estimated that, at present, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers contributes to about half of the observed sea level rise. Apart from a small contribution from human use of aquifers, the rest of the sea level rise is due to thermal expansion – the oceans are warming. The greenhouse effect The atmospheric trace gases – water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide – provide an explanation of the planetary energy imbalance. These gases are present in relatively small quantities in our atmosphere, but they have a significant impact on the temperature of the planet since they obstruct the loss of heat from the surface as it passes upwards. This effect, known as the greenhouse effect, causes the Earth’s surface to have an average temperature of 15C. Without it, the surface would be 15C below freezing. Ice cores drilled from ice sheets and glaciers in the Antarctic and Greenland provide a means of measuring past changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Each year the snowfall creates a layer that compacts to ice and traps bubbles of the contemporary air. The deepest ice cores extracted from the Antarctic are more than 3km long and contain a record stretching back 800,000 years. By melting the ice and measuring the ratios of different atomic isotopes in the water, a history of global temperature can be derived. The relationship between the trace gases and temperature can then be studied. During each recent cold phase, when on average global temperatures have decreased by 5C, and vast ice sheets have built up over northern high latitudes, the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere dipped to about 180 parts per million. In the warm phases it peaked at around 300 ppm. This year, the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere passed 400 ppm. The rise over the last century is already 100 ppm – the same as the natural change between an ice age and an interglacial warm period, but at a rate more than 100 times faster. And it is in the “warm” direction of increased concentration not experienced by the planet at any point over the last 800,000 years based on the ice core data, and probably not over the two million years judging by the geological record. This has occurred because the global carbon cycle has been disrupted. The cycle consists of large annual exchanges between the carbon reservoirs of the atmosphere, the land biosphere, the lithosphere (the rocky surface layer of the planet) and the ocean. The exchanges are much greater in magnitude than our own carbon emissions – but, prior to industrialisation, they were in balance. However, in 1712, the invention of the Newcomen steam engine started a chain reaction of innovation, technology and science that spread across the globe. This revolution built the modern world. It was fuelled using cheap, accessible and convenient fossil energy. This has led us to the point where we are currently burning 10,000 million tonnes of carbon per year – a figure that is increasing at a rate of 2% per year. To date, we have burned an estimated 530,000 million tonnes of carbon. A quarter of the resulting CO2 has been absorbed by vegetation on land, which has bloomed as a result, and just over a quarter by the ocean, which has become more acidic. The remainder will stay in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years because it takes that long for natural processes – mainly rock weathering – to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Consequently, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen by 40%. The energy imbalance revealed by the ocean, confirmed by rising temperatures and loss of ice, and explained by the disrupted carbon cycle, is evidently being driven by us. It is the unwitting result of our use of fossil fuels. The evidence seems compelling. But since the implications are sufficiently profound, a deeper evaluation is merited. This is the task given to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was set up in 1988 by the UN environment programme and the World Meteorological Organisation. Its job is to provide a comprehensive summary of the scientific data to inform the policy decisions of the UN framework convention on climate change. IPCC working group I reviews and assesses the physical science information relevant to human-induced climate change. Its most recent report – the fifth – was released in September 2013. It is arguably the most audited scientific document in history. The work was led by 209 scientists, who are regarded as the world experts in their fields. They were supported by more than 600 contributing authors from 32 countries and 50 review editors from 39 countries. Of the tens of thousands of publications sifted more than 9,200 were cited. The authors responded to 54,677 comments from 1,089 reviewers worldwide. So what do they conclude? The conclusions of the IPCC Concerning the atmosphere, each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the northern hemisphere the 30 years from 1983 to 2012 were likely to have been the warmest in the last 1,400 years. The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature measurements show a warming of 0.8C from 1850 to 2012. They note that despite the warming at and near the surface, the upper atmosphere has cooled, ruling out the Sun as the cause. They report that the rates of loss of ice from the world’s glaciers and from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have all increased dramatically. While glacier losses have increased globally by about 20%, the ice sheet losses increased by as much as 600% between the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. Summer minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic decreased over the last 30 years between 9% and 14% per decade. There is evidence that this level of ice retreat is unprecedented in the last 1,450 years. By contrast, winter sea ice extent in the Antarctic has increased slightly, at a rate of about 1.5% per decade. This appears to be driven by changes in the Southern Ocean winds, which have intensified in response to the planetary energy imbalance. They report that ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010. They confirm that the ocean has absorbed about 30% of the cumulative anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, causing it to become progressively more acidic. More recently, the IPCC released its overall synthesis report. This states: “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, [and] sea level has risen.” It observes that: “In recent decades, changes in the climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to the changing climate.” On the causes of climate change, the IPCC says: “It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 [to] 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.” It continues: “The best estimate of human-induced contributions to warming is similar to the actual warming observed.” In other words, there is evidence that all the warming that has occurred since 1950 is due to human actions. It concludes: “Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, which together with adaptation can limit climate change risks.” John Kerry, the US secretary of state, summarised the working group I findings as follows: “Boil down the IPCC report and here’s what you find: climate change is real, it’s happening now, human beings are the cause of the transformation, and only action by human beings can save the world from its worst impacts.” The cut-off date for published material considered by IPCC working group I was July 2013. But there have been some important results since. Evidence from the Argo floats, a system of 3,500 buoys deployed throughout the world’s oceans, shows that despite an 18-year pause in the rate of surface and atmospheric temperature rise, energy has continued to accumulate in the oceans unabated, with the prospect that some of it will be released to the atmosphere in the future. New data from the CryoSat satellite show the recent rate of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has doubled in three years. Some experts have concluded that the loss of ice from the West Antarctic ice sheet is now irreversible and that this will raise sea level by 1 to 2 metres in as little as a few hundred years. Based on a combination of scientific analysis, assessments of the impacts and related value judgments, the nations negotiating under the terms of the UN framework convention have set a limit beyond which climate change will be “dangerous”. That limit is 2C above the pre-industrial average. We are currently at 0.8C. Two-thirds of that increase has occurred since 1980. In order to stay below the 2C “guardrail”, human carbon emissions have to drop to 50% of the present level by 2050 and thereafter drop to zero. This would mean leaving 75% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. They would become economically worthless. The temperature at which the system will stabilise is determined by the total quantity of carbon we emit to the atmosphere, not the rate at which it’s emitted. So reducing carbon emissions to zero will not lower temperature; it will just prevent the temperature rising beyond the 2C level. Temperature will then remain at that level for a very long time because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. This sets a limit on the total carbon that we can burn. The IPCC calculates this to be about 800 gigatons of carbon. They estimate that we have already burned 530 gigatons. This leaves 270 gigatons for us to use. At our current rate, which is 10 gigatons of carbon a year, we have 27 years left, after which time carbon emissions would need to cease. Suppose we begin reducing our emissions next year and don’t exceed the overall 800 gigaton limit; then CO2 concentration will stabilise at 450 parts per million. Temperature will take longer to stabilise because it responds to CO2 concentration – but it will eventually stabilise at 2C. The oceans will continue to warm and the ice will continue to melt – so the sea level will continue to rise. It will take hundreds of years but will eventually stabilise at a level, based on evidence from past warmings, about 2 to 3 metres higher than today. If we leave it longer to start reducing emissions, we will have to reduce them more rapidly to avoid exceeding the overall 800 gigaton limit. Calculations show that if we leave it until 2020 – only five years away – the subsequent reductions would be of the order of 6% per year to stay within the 2C limit. 6% may not sound much, but annual reductions of carbon emissions greater than 1% have happened only during economic recession or upheaval. The UK conversion from coal to gas and the French conversion to nuclear in the 1970s and 80s achieved reductions of 1% per year. A temporary 5% reduction was achieved in the Soviet Union when it collapsed. Japan recently achieved a 15% reduction when its nuclear power stations were shut down, and demand fell as a result of a national appeal, after the Fukushima disaster. The 6% annual rate of reduction required is global. We in the developed world have to reduce emissions even more rapidly to accommodate growth in the developing world. To achieve the necessary reduction will require a collaborative effort on a global scale. Time is running out The aim of next December’s meeting in Paris is to forge a deal to put the world onto a path to a 2C maximum rise. The new agreement aims to obtain credible and fair emission reductions and legally binding commitments from all countries – with the most advanced economies making the most ambitious commitments. In the lead-up to Paris 2015, Barack Obama and Chinese president Xi Jinping have announced joint measures to fight climate change. The US aims to reduce its carbon emissions to 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – nearly doubling its previous commitments. Despite not having signed up to Kyoto or Copenhagen, the US is already on track to cut its emissions by 17% between 2005 and 2020. China, partly driven by serious air pollution problems, has committed to cutting the proportion of energy it generates from coal and has set up pilot carbon markets and low carbon zones. It has set a date of 2030 for “peak” emissions and has pledged to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to around 20% by 2030, from less than 10% today. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has committed to expand solar energy to provide electricity to 300 million people who have no access to power at present. The EU has agreed a package to achieve a 40% reduction in domestic emissions. It aims to boost the use of renewable energy to 27% and to increase energy efficiency by at least 27%. The UK Climate Change Act, passed in 2008 with cross-party support, is the world’s first long-term, legally binding, national framework for reducing emissions – setting five-year carbon budgets to cut UK emissions by 80% by 2050. Around the world, in recent years, almost 500 climate-related laws have been passed in 66 of the world’s largest emitting countries. In 2005 the mayors of the worlds 40 largest “megacities” – including London – met and formed the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. They have taken 4,734 actions to tackle climate change, over three-quarters of which have been implemented. Many individuals have taken measures to reduce their own climate-related impacts by making changes in their personal, professional and public lives – installing solar panels, increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, vehicles and appliances, using public transport and avoiding unnecessary travel, changing diet and by choosing to forgo activities that generate emissions. They have encouraged changes to be made in their workplaces and written to their MPs. They have sought to educate themselves about the issue and to talk about it to their friends, families and communities. Around the world, renewable power capacity grew at its strongest ever pace in 2013 and now produces 22% of world energy. More than $250bn was invested in “green” generating systems in 2013, although the growth is expected to slacken, partly because western politicians are seeking to reduce financial incentives. The growth rate of windfarms and solar plants in China, India and an array of smaller developing nations is starting to outpace that in the richest ones. This explains why investors are increasingly confident and keen to put their money on alternative energy. But despite all these measures, global carbon emissions continue to rise. To achieve the necessary reduction in carbon emissions will require the invention and mass roll-out of new technologies that do not exist yet. However, my experiences as director of the Science Museum from 2007-10, exploring the legacy of technical innovation on public display and held in its reserve collection, and of working with engineers on space projects during the exhilarating era of the 70s and 80s, convinces me that human ingenuity is unbounded and that technological advances can be very rapid. My hope lies with the engineers. But the right conditions need to be in place for innovation to occur. Progress is hard when other economic drivers inhibit the transformation. Fossil fuels are estimated by the International Energy Agency to receive subsidies of $500bn per year, six times the incentives to develop renewables. Suppose we fail to take the action needed to stay below the 2C guardrail. The IPCC working group I predicts that by the end of the century, if measures to mitigate emissions are weak, we could have committed to more than a 4C rise. No nation would be immune to the impacts of that level of climate change. Our infrastructure was built for the climate system we inherited and is not designed to cope with the climate system we are provoking. Our food and water supplies, housing, industry – our entire wellbeing and prosperity – depend on access to energy. And our primary source, at present, is fossil fuel. So we are confronted with a need to totally transform the world’s energy system. At the same time we need to ensure energy security, equity, sustainability and growth. So what does the future hold? I look at my eldest grandchild who will reach the age I am now in 2071. I encourage her to be an engineer. We are all dependent on energy. Almost everything we do depends on it. There will be carbon atoms that we each generate today that will still be in the air in 2071, in the air that my granddaughter will breathe. Science can inform, but it cannot arbitrate, it cannot decide. Science can say that if we burn another half-trillion tons of carbon the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide will go up by another 100 ppm and that will almost certainly lead to a warming of the planet greater than 2C, with major disruption of the climate system and huge risks for the natural world and human wellbeing. But it can’t answer moral questions. Do we care about the poor? Do we care about future generations? Do we see the environment as part of the economy, or the economy as part of the environment? The whole point about climate change is that, despite having been revealed by science, it is not really about science. It is about what sort of world we want to live in and what kind of future we want to create.

Motorbikes and vans now appear beside bicycles and bullock carts. Yet basic services remain just that: basic. With more than 32,000 villages continue to lack power, the absence of electrification represents a particular concern. Even those villages that have grid access, power outages represent a frequent frustration. In sun-drenched Rajasthan, Ajaita Shah is working to change that. Through Frontier Markets, a social enterprise she co-founded back in 2011, the 29-year-old cleantech entrepreneur is looking to provide solar-powered lighting solutions to some of the state's poorest citizens. \"Clean energy is the base foundation that's required before you can drive any other services\", says Shah, who was brought up in New York to émigré parents from Rajasthan. And the reward for the consumer is immediate, she adds. \"If you can provide light where there's no light, or power where there's no power, people are instantly satisfied.\" To date, Frontier Markets has helped shift around 20,000 zero-carbon lighting units across its network of 185 retail points. Low-cost solar lanterns and torches comprise the majority of the firm's sales, although its product range includes sophisticated home lighting systems and even streetlights too. Photovoltaics aren't new to India. Where Shah differs is in her focus on the poorest segment of the market – what the Indian management guru C K Prahalad famously terms, the base of the pyramid (BoP). Most solar manufacturers in India lack the capacity and knowledge to access this hard-to-reach sector, she says: \"No retailer or distributor today really knows their customers. They're just dumping their products in the market.\" Frontier Markets pitches itself as different. Shah's own insights into India's low-income market derive in large part from hands-on experience. Fresh from graduating in the US, she relocated to India to work in the country's rapidly expanding microfinance industry. \"I've lived in Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar, Andhra [Pradesh], Karnataka, really just trying to find out how villagers think and what they prefer\", says Shah, who was recently named in Forbes magazine's 30 under 30 list of social entrepreneurs. Yet the sheer size of India's low-income consumers - the total number of BoP households is estimated at 114 million – defies generalisations. So whenever Frontier Markets enters a new area, its researchers hit the ground with their notebooks, survey sheets, focus group materials and so forth. \"If they have five rupees, what would be the first thing they'd spend it on?\" That's the level of detail Shah wants for the 16 districts in Rajasthan where Frontier Markets operates. Shah might know who her low-income customers are and what energy needs they have, but the knotty question of how to physically get suitable products to them still exists. For the most part, companies tackle this so-called \"last mile\" problem through itinerant salespeople: \"Basically someone with a backpack who runs from door to door selling a product\", as Shah puts it. That's neither scalable nor sustainable, she insists. Instead, Frontier Markets opts to work with existing small retailers in its target communities, providing shop-owners with its products on credit. \"Essentially, we started converting existing bricks-and-mortar stores into solar shops\", Shah says. Where her start-up really breaks the mould is in its offer of after-care service. Frontier Markets operates six customer service centres, all located close to the communities where it works. \"If you're sitting in Delhi and the person who bought that product is in a village in Rajasthan, how are you going to replace that product? How are they getting it to you, and how are you getting it to them?\" she asks. \"After-sales service is so important because you need to be accountable for what you've sold.\" Price, as ever when selling to low-income communities, is critical as well. BoP consumers typically spend less than 3,453 Indian rupees (£34) on goods and services per month. Shah's solar lanterns retail at 645 rupees (£6) - a price point born of \"negotiating like crazy\" with her company's suppliers. That's just about affordable. At around 6,000 rupees (£59), its Pico home lighting system units probably aren't. For these bigger ticket items, Shah envisions making a low-interest loan option available via a non-profit or microfinance partner in the future. She challenges the general notion that those at the bottom of the pyramid lack spending power, however. \"They have money\", she insists (albeit not very much). \"But they're the most ruthless consumers on the face of this Earth because there's an opportunity cost of where that money goes\". The key is creating a willingness to pay, she continues. To that end, Frontier Markets recently partnered with the International Finance Corporation on an awareness campaign about the benefits of solar energy. The publicity blitz forms part of IFC's Lighting Asia initiative, which aims to bring lighting to 400 million Indians living off grid. It's an ambitious goal.

Obama unveiled a sweeping climate plan last June, after warning in last year's State of the Union address that if Congress did not act on climate change, he would. The president is expected to reaffirm his commitment to that plan in Tuesday night's address, defending his decision to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. He is also expected to offer details on actions by other federal government agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote wind and solar energy, and prepare for a future under climate change. \"I am sure it will be part of his comments in the State of the Union,\" Carol Browner, who served as White House climate adviser in Obama's first term, told a conference call with reporters. \"What we see is a real commitment to moving us forward.\" The core of Obama's climate plan remains the EPA's proposed rules for power plants, the largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions. The agency plans to release the next set of proposed rules, which would limit emissions from existing plants, by June of this year. Obama was widely expected to use the spotlight on Tuesday night to try to get the public behind the new power plant rules, that are at the core of his climate plan. But Heather Zichal, another former Obama climate adviser, said she expected other federal government agencies to take up climate change. Zichal said last week she expected the president to press for further tax credits and other incentives to promote renewable energy. But campaigners will be looking for Obama to expand even more on his climate plan. They are also unlikely to be happy with Obama's continued promotion of oil and gas drilling, somthing they say is incompatible with action on climate change. Obama was widely expected to talk up domestic oil production in the speech. \"I expect we will hear a message that is consistent with the 'all of the above' message we have heard before,\" Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said. Last year was the fourth hottest year on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency. Despite Obama's directive to the EPA, US carbon dioxide emissions rose 2% in 2013, because power plants burned more coal. Without additional measures, America will fail to meet its commitment to cut emissions by 17% from 2005 by 2020. Campaigners said they were looking to Obama to promise action on rising methane emissions produced by the country's shale boom. Recent studies have shown the gas industry – from well site to power station – produces far more methane than earlier government estimates, and methane is 80 times more powerful at warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. There were also calls for Obama to use the speech to reject the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which will transport crude oil from the Alberta tar sands to refineries on the Texas coast. \"From our perspective, there is just no way, no how this tar sands oil gets out of the ground,\" said Gene Karpinski, who heads the League of Conservation Voters. A political action committee founded by the former hedge fund manager and Keystone opponent, Tom Steyer, has bought ads to air on the MSNBC cable network on Tuesday night, urging Obama to reject the project. In Washington, protesters were planning to encircle Congress with a giant inflatable pipeline. However, it is extremely unlikely the president will announce a decision on Keystone XL in his speech."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/small-world/2014/mar/27/bionic-spinach-invisible-barcodes-nanotube-computers-nanotechnology","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-27T06:59:00Z","webTitle":"Bionic spinach, invisible barcodes and nanotube computers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/small-world/2014/mar/27/bionic-spinach-invisible-barcodes-nanotube-computers-nanotechnology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/small-world/2014/mar/27/bionic-spinach-invisible-barcodes-nanotube-computers-nanotechnology","fields":{"headline":"Bionic spinach, invisible barcodes and nanotube computers","bodyText":"Collecting the sun Sunlight provides us with an endless source of energy and there is little doubt future societies will need to rely, at least in part, on artificial solar power. The reason why not yet every house has a solar panel on its roof is the cost. But instead of covering a whole panel with expensive solar cells, sunlight could be trapped by a much cheaper material that concentrates light. One such concentrator contains dye particles that absorb sunlight and emit it again towards nearby solar cells. This idea has been around for a few decades, but so far has faced a practical hurdle: a large portion of the light emitted by the dye gets absorbed again before it reaches the solar cells. Researchers at Western Washington University have now tried a new type of dye for solar concentration, namely semiconductor nanocrystals that absorb only ultraviolet light and re-emit it as yellow light, so that it is not reabsorbed by the dye. The nanocrystals are embedded within a transparent polymer sheet. Preliminary results suggest that the material can concentrate sunlight by up to six times. Because the solar concentrator sheet is transparent, it could be applied as a window coating in future smart building designs. Bionic spinach Plants have much more efficient machinery for harvesting sunlight than any human-made solar energy device. However, they use only a small part of the solar spectrum and so scientists at MIT suggest that adding carbon nanotubes, which capture light over a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to near-infrared, could enhance natural photosynthesis. The team tried this out on spinach plants and found that injecting leaves with nanotubes boosted their \"photocurrent\" – a measure of their photosynthetic activity – by 30%. (The team also showed that adding nanotubes can turn plant leaves into real-time detectors for environmental pollutants such as nitric oxide.) Writing in the journal Nature Materials, they conclude that researchers trying to design efficient, biologically inspired light-harvesting devices could get some useful clues from studying the influence of nanoparticles on natural photosynthesis. A cash machine that strikes back Thieves will think twice about trying to break into an ATM that spoils and marks all the banknotes when the machine is tampered with. A team at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, has designed a foil that oozes hot foam when it is ruptured. It has two layers, each with a sealed compartment containing a different chemical, namely hydrogen peroxide and manganese oxide. A mechanical impact breaks the ultrathin barrier between the two compartments so that the chemicals mix and react to produce the foam, which stains banknotes. The researchers included nanoparticle labels in the manganese oxide compartment so that the banknotes can be forensically traced. The self-destructing foil may be an attractive alternative to existing electronic security systems, which are expensive and complex. Nanotube computers Ever since the birth of the integrated circuit, computers have got steadily smaller, faster and cheaper. Underlying this trend has been the gradual shrinking of the silicon transistor, the basic building block of an electronic chip. However, the silicon transistor is reaching its physical limit of smallness, beyond which it cannot function properly without overheating. The semiconductor industry is therefore considering different designs that may continue the upward trend in computer functionality, for example transistors made from carbon nanotubes, which operate much more energy efficiently. In 2013, the first complete nanotube computer was presented by researchers at Stanford. However, the transistors were enormous, comparable to what was state-of-the-art for silicon technology in the 70s. The Stanford team has caught up a few decades and now produces nanotube transistor circuits with a \"channel length\" – which defines the transistor size – down to 20 nanometres. The team has designed a complete working application – infrared sensing – using nanotube circuits that is compatible with fabrication technology introduced for silicon chips in 2010. Invisible barcodes Adulterating expensive oils has become a lucrative criminal activity, for example passing off cheap mixtures as extra virgin olive oil or cosmetic oils. One way to combat this new crime wave is to tag oils with invisible, harmless labels that contain information about their origin. Researchers from ETH Zurich in Switzerland have designed microscopic labels that can be mixed into oils and retrieved for testing from small samples using magnets. Taking inspiration from nature's highly efficient information storage and retrieval system, they use strands of artificial DNA as barcodes. These are attached to iron oxide nanoparticles, so the barcodes can be separated from the oil in a magnetic field, and encased in a protective shell of silica. To read the labels, the silica shell is dissolved by a chemical and the DNA inside is sequenced. The procedure has been tested on samples of bergamot oil, gasoline and olive oil, demonstrating that only very small concentrations of the labels are required to authenticate the oils and detect any illegal dilution. The labels will need to pass toxicity tests before they can be used commercially, but this should prove straightforward as both silica and iron oxide are already approved food additives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/feb/17/tony-abbott-leaves-climate-change-out","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-17T03:30:59Z","webTitle":"Tony Abbott leaves climate change out of his drought relief calculations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/tony-abbott-leaves-climate-change-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/17/tony-abbott-leaves-climate-change-out","fields":{"headline":"Tony Abbott leaves climate change out of his drought relief calculations","bodyText":"It seems obvious, but apparently it isn’t. If you remove the reality of climate change from government decision-making you risk making the wrong decisions. Obviously the drought is causing extreme hardship for farmers in parts of New South Wales and Queensland and the government is about to announce a package of short-term measures to assist them. But surely long-term drought policy needs to take into account the evidence that climate change means rainfall patterns are changing and that also means changes in what can be farmed, and where. Asked about this on Monday, prime minister Tony Abbott appeared to suggest it did not. He said records going back 150 years showed there had always been “good times and bad times”, that there had been “droughts since the beginning of settlement”. In other words, just as the government refused to accept climate change might lead to an increased frequency of bushfire weather, it also appears to reject the idea that climate change might have a bearing on the frequency or location of drought, or on the long-term farming conditions of particular farming areas. President Barack Obama sees the link between US weather patterns, farming and climate change. Meeting drought-stricken farmers in California on Friday he foreshadowed a $1bn “climate resilience fund”. And before the Abbott government abolished it, the independent climate commission in its Critical Decade report suggested Australia was facing similar pressures. It said that “changing rainfall patterns, the increasing risk of extreme heat and bushfire weather present challenges for Australian agriculture. Production of temperature and water sensitive broad acre crops, fruit, vegetables and wine grapes need to adapt to these changing growing conditions or move to locations where growing conditions are more amenable to their production.” Similarly, the just-announced review of the renewable energy target is asking the right questions but seems to be driven more by some exaggerated assessments of the impact of the RET on power bills and less by why it could be a good idea to continue to encourage the use of more renewable energy. After recent cabinet divisions about who should do the review and how far it should go, Abbott told Alan Jones on Monday morning the government was “very close” to announcing it, and that it would report within months. Asked by Jones, “how can we justify providing subsidies to solar energy and wind power with borrowed money when many of those companies are foreign companies, Thai companies for example?”, Abbott replied, “well, that is a very fair point, Alan, and that is why we are very close to announcing a review into this which will report in a matter of months and then the government will have more to say because just as the carbon tax is massively boosting power prices, the renewable energy targets are also having an impact on prices. Not as great, but still not insignificant. What this government wants to do is bear down on prices.” Last December, Abbott described the price impact of the Renewable Energy Target (RET) as “pretty significant”. According to the Australian Energy Market Commission in 2013-14 the RET was responsible for around 4% of the average household bill, falling to a likely 3.1% in 2014-15. Other estimates, from the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal and the Queensland Competition Authority, fall within a range of between 3% and 5% of retail electricity bills. But because the RET is already providing ongoing subsidies to existing renewable energy projects, reducing or removing it will not translate into an immediate removal of the small price impact it has had so far. Modelling for the climate change authority by Sinclair Knight Merz found removing the RET altogether would reduce an average household bill by just $15 a year. And the climate change authority, when it last reviewed the RET in December 2012, found there was a good case to keep it to continue to encourage investment in renewable power. Of course if it hadn’t factored in the impact of climate change or the long-term need to change Australia’s fossil fuel use in response to it, it would have come up with a very different calculation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/planet-oz/2014/aug/04/geoengineering-the-earths-climate-sends-policy-debate-down-a-curious-rabbit-hole","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-04T00:34:21Z","webTitle":"Geoengineering the Earth's climate sends policy debate down a curious rabbit hole | Graham Readfearn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/aug/04/geoengineering-the-earths-climate-sends-policy-debate-down-a-curious-rabbit-hole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/aug/04/geoengineering-the-earths-climate-sends-policy-debate-down-a-curious-rabbit-hole","fields":{"headline":"Geoengineering the Earth's climate sends policy debate down a curious rabbit hole","bodyText":"There’s a bit in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland where things get “curiouser and curiouser” as the heroine tries to reach a garden at the end of a rat-hole sized corridor that she’s just way too big for. She drinks a potion and eats a cake with no real clue what the consequences might be. She grows to nine feet tall, shrinks to ten inches high and cries literal floods of frustrated tears. I spent a couple of days at a symposium in Sydney last week that looked at the moral and ethical issues around the concept of geoengineering the Earth’s climate as a “response” to global warming. No metaphor is ever quite perfect (climate impacts are no ‘wonderland’), but Alice’s curious experiences down the rabbit hole seem to fit the idea of medicating the globe out of a possible catastrophe. And yes, the fact that in some quarters geoengineering is now on the table shows how the debate over climate change policy is itself becoming “curiouser and curiouser” still. It’s tempting too to dismiss ideas like pumping sulphate particles into the atmosphere or making clouds whiter as some sort of surrealist science fiction. But beyond the curiosity lies actions being countenanced and discussed by some of the world’s leading scientific institutions. What is geoengineering? Geoengineering – also known as climate engineering or climate modification - comes in as many flavours as might have been on offer at the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party. Professor Jim Falk, of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute at the University of Melbourne, has a list of more than 40 different techniques that have been suggested. They generally take two approaches. Carbon Dioxide Reduction (CDR) is pretty self explanatory. Think tree planting, algae farming, increasing the carbon in soils, fertilising the oceans or capturing emissions from power stations. Anything that cuts the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) techniques are concepts to try and reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the earth. Think pumping sulphate particles into the atmosphere (this mimics major volcanic eruptions that have a cooling effect on the planet), trying to whiten clouds or more benign ideas like painting roofs white. Geoengineering on the table In 2008 an Australian Government–backed research group issued a report on the state-of-play of ocean fertilisation, recording there had been 12 experiments carried out of various kinds with limited to zero evidence of “success”. This priming of the “biological pump” as its known, promotes the growth of organisms (phytoplankton) that store carbon and then sink to the bottom of the ocean. The report raised the prospect that larger scale experiments could interfere with the oceanic food chain, create oxygen-depleted “dead zones” (no fish folks), impact on corals and plants and various other unknowns. The Royal Society – the world’s oldest scientific institution – released a report in 2009, also reviewing various geoengineering technologies. In 2011, Australian scientists gathered at a geoengineering symposium organised by the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. The London Protocol – a maritime convention relating to dumping at sea – was amended last year to try and regulate attempts at “ocean fertilisation” – where substances, usually iron, are dumped into the ocean to artificially raise the uptake of carbon dioxide. The latest major United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also addressed the geoengineering issue in several chapters of its latest report. The IPCC summarised geoengineering this way. CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on a global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. Modelling indicates that SRM methods, if realizable, have the potential to substantially offset a global temperature rise, but they would also modify the global water cycle, and would not reduce ocean acidification. If SRM were terminated for any reason, there is high confidence that global surface temperatures would rise very rapidly to values consistent with the greenhouse gas forcing. CDR and SRM methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. Towards the end of this year, the US National Academy of Sciences will be publishing a major report on the “technical feasibility” of some geoengineering techniques. Fighting Fire With Fire The symposium in Sydney was co-hosted by the University of New South Wales and the Sydney Environment Institute at the University of Sydney (for full disclosure here, they paid my travel costs and one night stay). Dr Matthew Kearnes, one of the organisers of the workshop from UNSW, told me there was “nervousness among many people about even thinking or talking about geoengineering.” He said: I would not want to dismiss that nervousness, but this is an agenda that’s now out there and it seems to be gathering steam and credibility in some elite establishments. Internationally geoengineering tends to be framed pretty narrowly as just a case of technical feasibility, cost and efficacy. Could it be done? What would it cost? How quickly would it work? We wanted to get a way from the arguments about the pros and cons and instead think much more carefully about what this tells us about the climate change debate more generally. The symposium covered a range of frankly exhausting philosophical, social and political considerations – each of them jumbo-sized cans full of worms ready to open. Professor Stephen Gardiner, of the University of Washington, Seattle, pushed for the wider community to think about the ethical and moral consequences of geoengineering. He drew a parallel between the way, he said, that current fossil fuel combustion takes benefits now at the expense of impacts on future generations. Geoengineering risked making the same mistake. Clive Hamilton’s book Earthmasters notes “in practice any realistic assessment of how the world works must conclude that geoengineering research is virtually certain to reduce incentives to pursue emission reductions”. Odd advocates Curiouser still, is that some of the world’s think tanks who shout the loudest that human-caused climate change might not even be a thing, or at least a thing not worth worrying about, are happy to countenance geoengineering as a solution to the problem they think is overblown. For example, in January this year the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a US-based think tank founded by Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg, issued a submission to an Australian Senate inquiry looking at overseas aid and development. Lomborg’s center has for many years argued that cutting greenhouse gas emissions is too expensive and that action on climate change should have a low-priority compared to other issues around the world. Lomborg himself says human-caused climate change will not turn into an economic negative until near the end of this century. Yet Lomborg’s submission told the Australian Senate suggested that every dollar spent on “investigat[ing] the feasibility of planetary cooling through geoengineering technologies” could yield “$1000 of benefits” although this, Lomborg wrote, was a “rough estimate”. But these investigations, Lomborg submitted, “would serve to better understand risks, costs, and benefits, but also act as an important potential insurance against global warming”. Engineering another excuse Several academics I’ve spoken with have voiced fears that the idea of unproven and potentially disastrous geoengineering technologies being an option to shield societies from the impacts of climate change could be used to distract policy makers and the public from addressing the core of the climate change issue – that is, curbing emissions in the first place. But if the idea of some future nation, or group of nations, or even corporations, some embarking on a major project to modify the Earth’s climate systems leaves you feeling like you’ve fallen down a surreal rabbit hole, then perhaps we should also ask ourselves this. Since the year 1750, the world has added something in the region of 1,339,000,000,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (that’s 1.34 trillion tonnes) to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and cement production. Raising the level of CO2 in the atmosphere by 40 per cent could be seen as accidental geoengineering.

Curated by the British Council with the Arts Catalyst, Ice Lab brings together a series of research stations from the last decade of our forays into Antarctica – extreme buildings for one of the most inhospitable places on the planet. The exhibition, on show at the Lighthouse gallery in Glasgow before travelling to Manchester in October, comes after the recent completion of Halley VI, the latest iteration of Britain's home on the Brunt Ice Shelf, where temperatures drop to -50C, winds rage at 100mph, and the next nearest humans are 700 miles away. With snow levels rising by over a metre annually, it is a climate that has caused previous stations to be buried every 10 years. Photos show the rusty frame of Halley III emerging from a thick white cliff-face, like chocolate shards in a slice of Viennetta. To avoid the same fate, Halley VI can move. Jacked up on ski-legs, its bulbous pods can be dragged over the ice, recalling the Walking City of 1960s dreamers Archigram. It has the same pop sensibility, with capsules wrapped in union flag colours like a little piece of Britain laid out across the endless white sheet. National customs also continue within. Menus from the scientists' midwinter feasts in the 1950s feature toasts to the Queen, in between courses of penguin's eggs – a dish that has since been strictly outlawed. While Halley's pods extend like the carriages of a train or a street of terraced houses, it is interesting to see how other countries have opted for structures that reflect their own national characters. The American McMurdo base rambles in a complex of big box industrial sheds, like a chunk of suburban sprawl. It is thought to have the biggest carbon footprint of any building in the world. The Belgian base, Princess Elisabeth, is the first zero-emission station, powered by wind and solar energy and built from super-insulated wooden cassettes. Photos show its crew assembled around a long banqueting table, with exposed timber beams giving the feeling of a cosy beer hall. The Indian Bharathi station shares similar eco-credentials, constructed from the very shipping containers that carried the building equipment to the site. Fitted with long panoramic windows, its interior has the look of a first-class airport lounge from the 1970s, with reclining executive chairs and cream leather sofas. It is a far cry from the slick computer renderings of South Korea's ambitious Jang Bogo complex, due to open next year as one of the biggest stations yet. A stealthy three-pronged star, encrusted with a blue sequin skin of solar cells, its aerodynamic body hovers above the ice on delicate legs. It is the encapsulation of Korea's fast-paced technology-driven national identity. Compared with the primitive cabins of the first Antarctic explorers, these are buildings as high-performance machines, the architectural equivalent of zip-up Gore-Tex to Shackleton's tweed. As architect Sam Jacob writes in an accompanying essay, they show a \"hyper-accelerated history of architecture itself, progressing from the hut to the space station in just over a hundred years\". It is an architectural leap that mimics a scientific leap: researchers now spend their time launching balloons to search for primordial antimatter and hunting for ghost particles with a telescope buried 2.4km into the ice. There are hints of a possible next chapter to come. David Garcia, of speculative studio Map architects, exhibits a plan for a subterranean station imagined as a spidery network of wormholes and caves, burrowed into the ice using caterpillar diggers. Inspired by the way igloos use compacted snow for insulation it would, he says, entirely remove the need to transport foreign materials to Antarctica. Nor would it require dismantling or removal, melting in seven to 10 years and leaving no trace. The future of Antarctic architecture may be entirely invisible.

This is a greenhouse with a surprising wow factor. Inside, you can make out the blue of the fish tanks containing male tilapia (a species chosen as they grow rapidly to harvest size and as one of yesterday's visitors put it \"taste lovely on a barbecue\") and the raised beds full of fledgling vegetable crops. Of course, there is also much that you can't see – which is rather the point with a closed-loop food production system that needs little interference; the vegetable beds fill and drain, twice an hour, sustained by nutrient-rich water from the fish tanks. That this breakthrough technology with implications for the nation's diet is all going on on a little farm in Monmouthshire rather than in an agricultural science institution might seem incongruous, but that has everything to do with the tenacity of the farm's owner, TV presenter Kate Humble. When the Guardian visited her back in April it was clear she believes wholeheartedly in the regeneration of small-scale farming, and the company, Humble by Nature, she runs from this working farm, hosts courses that range from dry stone walling to keeping pigs designed for people to \"leave filthy, exhausted and with their clothing completely ruined\". Three years ago this farm was about to be broken up and sold on because 117 acres was considered too small to be useful or profitable. Humble was determined that a farm of this size should and could work, and became convinced that the science of aquaponics was key. Determination seems to have been turned into a type of rocket fuel when she got angry – always a powerful motivating force. \"I was listening one morning to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme and I heard an interview with someone from a food bank scheme in Moreton-in-the-Marsh. He said something to the effect of: 'It's all very well being surrounded by pretty green fields, but that doesn't produce food.' I thought 'What the hell is going on?'\" She is not alone in asking herself that question and nor in her disgust that we increasingly view rural populations as unable or unwilling to grow food. Fortunately she discovered across scientists Charlie Price and Becky Bainbridge of social enterprise, Aquaponics UK, who are devoted to growing more food in less space. \"We wanted to create a model to produce food in a low input way,\" explains Price, who is also an expert in biomass energy, \"but to do so in a building that required very little energy. Ultimately it's nothing new, it's a combination of existing technologies put together in a structure.\" In many ways it's about taking the heat out of the energy, water and oil requirements that dog conventional agriculture and even aquaculture and hydroponics. As Humble explains it: \"You’ve got your fish in your tanks, tilapia – which do well in aquaculture - shitting away merrily, and that water full of nitrates is pumped through vegetable beds. The leafy greens love the nitrates and grow like fury, the vegetables clean the water and back it goes to the fish.\" In terms of energy, the passive thermal structure, with a thermal mass wall, captures and stores as much solar energy as possible, and then releases it into the greenhouse at night. It requires very little supplementary heating (it also wears a special thermal quilt at night). In essence this mimics the airflow of a termite mound, in a nod to biomimicry. Feeding is also self-sustaining: the fish are fed primarily on worms from the wormeries at the back of the structure (which also supply worm tea, used as a pest preventative as a spray on the plants in the beds) but also from black soldier flies. Whereas conventional aquaculture often falls down on sustainability by the consumption of fish food from wild caught fish, the black soldier flies here eat until they pupate, then self-harvest with the aid of a cleverly positioned ramp and become fish food. And this is a completely organic system (there are no petroleum-based pesticides). In a naturally balanced system, pest control is left to species who do it naturally, and techniques such as companion planting. 'We even tried chameleons to eat pests,' says Becky Bainbridge, 'but in fact they just ate everything, even the good pests.' Now they leave it to ladybirds to deal with aphids. In terms of yield, even this 'smallholder scale' trial hub promises much. Based on German trials, it could soon be producing between 30 and 35 kgs of fruit and vegetables a week and 200 kgs of fish a year, more than enough to supply the restaurant and cafe on site, redefining local food. The massive boon for aquaponics is of course the extended growing season it offers; despite lecturing that we must eat in season, there seems little appetite to adjust our diet accordingly. Aquaponics, in theory offers us a chance to have our bananas and eat them (all year around). Could aquaponics, the marriage of hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) and aquaculture (the farming of aquatic organisms) be key to boosting our food self-sufficiency and our resilience to overseas price hikes? We do need some answers. A recent University of Cambridge report tells us at the moment we're running a food, feed and drink deficit of £18.6bn. By 2030 there will be 70 million of us on these shores and the researchers tell us we'll face a 2m hectare shortfall in productive land needed to produce food. What's amazing given its potential is that aquaponics has been given so little air time. You are more likely to find United Nations FAO reports and symposiums on raising insects for the table (an interesting idea but with huge societal cultural barriers in western Europe) than a food system like this which addresses the challenges of energy in food production head on in closed-loop system. \"The reality is agriculture since the green revolution has been focused on monocrops,\" explains Price, \"and putting a lot of energy into the individual crop and tailoring chemicals to make that crop as productive as possible. By contrast this is an integrated, multi-trophic ecosystem. It requires a shift in thinking. There's value in that but also it's complicated. For example if you're doing all sorts of things – raising insects for food, and different crops and species all under one system, who do you go to for funding?\" In this case to the Welsh government who have funded the project to the tune of £200,000 through the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens, an organisation trained on \"reinventing common sense agriculture\" and through their flagship Welsh project Tyfu Pobl (Growing People). As well as training up some of their communities in aquaponics at Humble by Nature they'll be looking to harvest a lot of data. Essentially what they and everybody wants to know is whether this is replicable for communities up and down the land. As we speak a proposal for a solar aquaponic greenhouse 20 times as large as this one is being considered for planning in West Sussex. Is it time for aquaponics to have its moment in the sun?

It is rare for one person to encapsulate what is known about climate change in a single manuscript. But Professor Eggleton has done just that with his new text, A Short Introduction to Climate Change. I'm going to be reviewing it at greater length for the National Center for Science Education's journal Reports of the National Center for Science Education, but I'm so enthusiastic about it that I didn't want to wait to publicize it. Professor Eggleton covers the waterfront on climate change, clearly articulating what we know, and what we don't know, about our Earth. Beginning with his own journey as a scientist, sharing his motivation for writing the book, Tony quickly moves into the foundations of climate change. While it is obvious Tony's view is shaped by his geography (Australia), he writes for a worldwide audience. The changes to Australia that he observes are being manifested around the world, in our neighborhoods too. First, Tony describes global warming by focusing on the markers of a warming planet: how the world is reacting as extreme weather events increase and climate zones move. Importantly, he carefully describes how scientists take measurements of the Earth. In his chapter on weather and climate, Tony faces some of the common misconceptions about climate. Readers learn that weather changes on a day-to-day or year-to-year basis; it will continue to change in the future. But those changes are not climate change. Here he discusses the astronomical and human causes of long-term climate variability in an honest, accurate, and compelling manner. Next, Tony covers the Earth's temperature as it is determined from solar energy and greenhouse gases. He artfully connects metaphor with fact in his descriptions of human and natural variability and Earth-system thermodynamics. In the second part of the book, which covers droughts, floods, snow, ice, and the ocean, Tony presents up-to-date information about the trends we have observed and the trends we expect to see in the coming decades. His science is solid and his appreciation of the complexities of observing the entire globe is excellent. He carefully explains the difference between regional and global climate patterns. He also describes the under-appreciated reality of ocean acidification in a way that will be appreciated by chemists yet accessible by non-experts. For his encore, Dr. Eggleton demolishes the tried and true tricks of those who deny the clear and compelling evidence of climate change. Many of these denialists are not scientists (although they want you to think they are); some are scientists who are unreasonably picky about the information they accept. By searching the world for scant evidence that humans are not causing climate change, these persons are forced to ignore enormous amounts of information that contradict their positions. By showing examples of how easy it is to be fooled, Professor Eggleton has done us all a tremendous service. He finishes with a touch of policy and personal action for those who wish to make this world a better place. As a practicing scientist who lives and breathes climate change, I find tremendous value in this book. I see in it ways to better articulate complicated subjects and it is refreshing to see such broad coverage in one text. But this book has a much wider appeal. It is a must-read for anyone who is concerned about the climate—everyone from concerned citizens, to parents, grandparents, students, and teachers. This is a book that is accessible and accurate. It is hard to imagine this could have been done better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/campaign-drax-biofuels-effects-replacing-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-24T13:26:09Z","webTitle":"The campaign against Drax aims to reveal the perverse effects of biofuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/campaign-drax-biofuels-effects-replacing-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/campaign-drax-biofuels-effects-replacing-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"The campaign against Drax aims to reveal the perverse effects of biofuels","bodyText":"Replacing fossil fuels with biofuels is, on the surface, an attractive idea. Rather than dig fossil carbon (oil, coal, gas) out of the ground, why not recycle the carbon already in the atmosphere? Plants use solar energy to incorporate carbon into their biomass; we can then burn them and cycle the carbon back into the atmosphere where the plants got it. No new carbon is released. There is a dark side to this glittering promise, though. Too often, the quest to turn plants into fuel replicates or exceeds the worst effects of other extractive technologies. For example, in Brazil's Cerrado region, a massive land grab is underway to convert diverse ecosystems and locally sustaining agricultural land into monoculture eucalyptus tree farms. To do that, non-deeded public land (the commons) that has been farmed by families for generations is being appropriated and privatised by agribusinesses. Huge logging operations are devastating the Carolina swamp forests, which are among the world's most biodiverse temperate forests and home to the only wild population of Venus fly traps and other carnivorous plants. The forests are being cut down to make wood pellets, some of which are shipped to the UK to feed the Drax electrical generation facility. In Indonesia, native forests and peatlands are being destroyed to make room for palm oil plantations to produce biodiesel – often, again, through land grabs at the expense of local farmers. Palm oil plantations are also spreading in Africa. US corn ethanol production has resulted in the vast expansion of cornfields into conservation land, untouched prairie land, and wetlands. Increasing amounts of chemical fertilisers and pesticides contaminate water supplies, and erosion has accelerated as fragile land is planted with corn. OK, so biofuel production can be ecologically catastrophic, but at least it is carbon neutral, right? Well, not really. For one thing, for clearcut forests to fully regenerate takes decades or even centuries, resulting in a CO2 increase over the next 50 years. Secondly, deforestation often results in soil erosion and the release of carbon from formerly stable soil structures. Thirdly, when biofuel is produced from corn or sugar cane plantations, these have less embedded carbon than a mature forest would. Clearly, current biofuel practices have to stop. While there may be a legitimate role for small-scale production of biofuels, industrial-scale operations are revealing themselves to be just as ecologically disruptive as fossil fuels and just as socially disruptive as other kinds of monocropping. Appalled by what is happening, an anti-biofuels movement is growing – for example, a protest against the Drax plant, which is at the forefront of Britain's push toward biofuels, took place yesterday in London. Companies such as Drax, Enviva (the woodchip mill operator in North Carolina) or Suzano (the company involved with eucalyptus plantations) benefit from government subsidies and other policies designed to promote biofuels; all three see themselves as green corporate citizens. Are they operating a cynical public relations campaign and, motivated by sheer greed, putting a green facade over practices they know to be destructive? Many activists seem to think so, but the truth may be more complicated. They might genuinely believe their rhetoric. Even when they make statements to the effect that \"we only burn forest wastes and residues\", which critics allege is not the case, they may live in a narrative that says \"we are working to improve our practices.\" As long as they can plausibly argue that they are developing a carbon-neutral energy source, they can maintain an image (to themselves and to others) as environmental do-gooders. The situation with biofuels highlights the danger of making greenhouse gas reduction our number one environmental priority. The devastating effects of industrial biofuel production, and the pollution generated by woodchip-fired power plants – which are dirtier than coal in terms of nitrogen oxides, VOCs, particulates and carbon monoxide – illustrates that much harm can be justified (albeit sometimes spuriously) on CO2 grounds. Arguments such as \"we should oppose razing the forests to plant monocrop tree farms because they actually don't help with CO2\" carry the implication that if they did help with CO2, such practices would be OK. More generally, the greenhouse gas argument buys into a utilitarian logic that values forests, oceans and rivers for some instrumental end, and not in their own right as living beings. This is a primary enabling attitude behind our society's destruction of nature. Arguments that implicitly validate the idea that nature is to be valued only as a means to an end (for example, as a \"resource\") do not touch the deep love and care we need to access, if we are to have the courage to embark on fundamental systemic change. Proponents of biofuels argue that the current problems can be fixed, and that the issue of greenhouse gases trumps other environmental issues. But even if biofuels could offer a carbon-neutral fuel source, we need to reflect on the kind of planet we want to live on. Do we want a world where the wild places are mostly gone, converted to biofuel plantations? Do we want a world in which nature exists just to burn? We don't, but that is fundamentally how our economic system, in which companies like Drax are embedded, sees nature. Quite possibly, the perverse consequences of what at first blush seems like a great idea are the inevitable results of seeing nature as a resource. As long as that doesn't change, we will continue to do more harm even while trying to do good. Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

Europeans are worried. In recent weeks, devastating winds and floods throughout western Europe raised further concern about extreme weather events, but it's the big picture that alarms the population at large: in a future defined by our success or failure to tackle climate change, are today's leaders ready to act? Nine in 10 European citizens now consider climate change a \"serious problem\", a Eurobarometer poll revealed this month. This week, European heads of state have an opportunity to address their concerns when they meet to discuss a package of new climate-related measures and targets for 2030. It is one of the first in a delicate sequence of international events and summits over the next two years, concluding with a major conference in Paris, in December 2015. What happens in Brussels this week could have life-or-death repercussions for millions of people now and billions more in the future. Climate change is a slow, grinding crisis but urgent action is needed to defuse it. The EU has often been the driver of the world's ambition – morally, politically, economically – in tackling climate change. There have been setbacks, but its overall record is a model to others on the world stage. Its leadership has created the space for other blocs, such as the world's least developed countries, to make themselves heard. And this week, Europe cannot falter. The targets decided now will set the terms for further negotiations. Europe must seize the opportunity to act now and create momentum towards a robust, universal, fair and legally binding agreement in Paris in next year. The implications of climate change are vast and complex, but two things are clear. If the EU agrees a package this week, it will have a chance to lead discussions at a major summit convened by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon in New York this September. And if Europe does not lead, who will? The signals are that the other great powers may not be ready to speak out. This risks leaving many of the more vulnerable – and more outspoken – small islands, least developed and Latin American countries without an ally. And the target itself should be ambitious enough to be meaningful. The European commission's current proposal of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 on 1990 levels is not enough to guarantee Europe's status as a leader in climate negotiations – or to meet its own objective of reducing its carbon emissions by 95% in 2050. With clear, strong policy signals and targets, European businesses can boost their competitiveness. The United States and China are also making progress in adapting their economies to meet climate targets, and Europe is losing ground. Those two countries now lead the world in wind power capacity, and are catching up with Germany and Italy, the world leaders in solar energy. European businesses must be given the conditions to compete or may lose their edge completely. We aren't naïve. We know it is complicated to negotiate an agreement among 28 countries. But as Elders, we believe leaders' decisions must be accountable to moral imperatives. Addressing climate change is also a matter of justice. If we are to be true to our commitment to human rights, then rich nations owe a fair and honest deal to the world's most vulnerable regions. The people on the frontline of climate change have often done the least to cause it. This means reducing the suffering of those worst affected and acting now to avoid further suffering in the future. It also means sharing technology, funds and solutions to help vulnerable countries and communities to engage fully in the transition to a low-carbon world. As the cradle of the industrial revolution, Europe created our carbon-heavy world and must lead the world into its next, low-carbon, safer and more caring chapter. As Elders, representing different parts of the world and a shared moral compass, we would like to encourage and support leaders in the EU to act in the interests of their own citizens and the citizens of the world. Strong action on climate change in Europe will help EU members to maintain their competitive edge and be ahead of the curve in the transition to low-carbon development. It will also help the countries and communities least responsible for the causes of climate change to make their voices heard in partnership with a strong ally; an ally that acknowledges and acts on their responsibility for carbon emissions. Current and future generations, our grandchildren and great grandchildren, need the world to act decisively now to avoid dangerous climate change. The EU is well-placed to create the positive momentum needed to enable others to act. Tackling climate change is in Europe's economic interest. It is also a chance to display leadership at its finest. • Former Irish president Mary Robinson and Archbishop Desmond Tutu are members of The Elders, a group of independent leaders working for peace, justice and human rights worldwide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"nanotechnology-world/can-nanotechnology-provide-cheaper-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"nanotechnology-world","sectionName":"Nanotechnology world","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-20T13:28:33Z","webTitle":"Can nanotechnology provide cheaper solar energy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/nanotechnology-world/can-nanotechnology-provide-cheaper-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/nanotechnology-world/can-nanotechnology-provide-cheaper-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Can nanotechnology provide cheaper solar energy?","bodyText":"It is hard to ignore the escalating price of oil. It is not just the hole that it is burning in our pockets on the forecourt; the increasing scarcity and lack of security surrounding oil and gas is also helping to push up the overall cost of living, from heating our homes to the price of everyday consumer products. Even medicine and food now cost more because of oil. Against this background, scientists and engineers believe that the development of novel nanomaterials may hold the key to help us reverse this trend, by enabling us to produce and store energy more efficiently. One prime example of this is solar energy. Despite decades of development, solar cells are still relatively expensive. This not only makes solar an unattractive and uncompetitive alternative to fossil fuels, but it ensures that the technology is not deployed where it is most needed, says Ineke Malsch of Malsch TechnoValuation, a consultancy based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, that specialises in assessing emerging technologies. \"There is already a technology gap between rich and poor countries,\" she says. \"People living with no grid electricity will benefit more from solar cells than those living in places like London.\" Nanotechnology has the potential to redress this imbalance by bringing down the cost of solar energy, says Malsch. One of the reasons for the high cost of traditional semiconductor photovoltaic solar cells is their poor design, says Milo Shaffer, co-director of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, at Imperial College. The most efficient cells tend to be made up of layers of expensive crystalline silicon. These have chemicals added to encourage particles of light, called photons, to liberate electrons, which pass from one layer to the other to create a current. While this works, it could be done using cheaper materials and in ways that are more efficient, says Shaffer. The amount of energy converted from light into electricity ultimately depends upon how many electrons can pass across the interface between the two layers. And this is limited by the size of that interface, he says. One way nanotechnology can help is by increasing the size of these interfaces by creating incredibly bumpy surfaces. \"What you are trying to do is create very high surface areas at the interface,\" says Shaffer. This allows more electrons to pass, increasing the amount of electricity produced. One kind of new solar cell that does precisely this is the dye-sensitised solar cell, or Graetzel cell. Instead of using two layers of silicon these solar cells consist of a highly porous layer of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, a common white material often used in paint, coated in a molecular dye (the molecules of which use sunlight to mimic chlorophyll and create energy). These cells are more flexible than traditional solar cells, they can work in higher temperatures and they can operate even in low-lighting conditions; but the key benefit is the size of the interface and thus the potential to create energy. Because of its porous nature the amount of surface area covered by the dye is much larger than the apparent area of the cell, says co-inventor Michael Graetzel at the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, in Lausanne. \"You increase the surface area by at least a thousand times,\" he says. It's a highly effective trick, and one which is also being used to create extremely high-surface areas in new kinds of batteries that can store many times more energy than existing cells, but which can be charged in the blink of an eye. And similarly ultraporous nanomaterials are being developed to help find ways of storing hydrogen at high densities for fuel-cell powered cars. Further down the line, Nasa's Jeremiah McNatt is leading on an approach that uses quantum dots – small semiconductor particles just a few nanometres in size – to help boost the performance of solar cells even further. The aim here is to replace the heavy, fragile solar cells that are currently used by spacecraft with ones that incorporate a mixture of organic and inorganic nanostructured materials, to make ultra-lightweight and flexible solar cells. But with this kind of technology also come new concerns. \"As you approach the nanoscale, things behave differently,\" says David Koepsell, a philosopher at Delft University in the Netherlands, and author of Innovation and Nanotechnology: Converging Technologies and the End of Intellectual Property. This is half the attraction of using nanomaterials, but it has also led to fears that materials that are benign in ordinary form could be hazardous when nano-sized. Because of this, existing regulations may not be enough to cover nanomaterials, he says. For workers involved in the manufacturing or disposal of these kinds of solar cells, a degree of caution may be warranted to ensure their safety and the safety of the environment. In light of this, the European Commission has created a code of conduct to address issues such as sustainability, accountability and what precautions need to be put in place when developing nanotechnologies. In order to implement the code of conduct, the NanoCode project has been set up to identify best practices from research labs so they can be applied not only to manufacturing, but to the whole lifecycle of a product. The bottom line, according to Malsch, is if you treat these nanoparticles as though they are hazardous materials and take measures to ensure they are contained during manufacture and disposal, then you can avoid any unpleasant surprises in the years to come."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"books/2015/sep/11/making-weather-english-writing-art-alexandra-harris","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-11T14:00:04Z","webTitle":"Making the weather in English writing and art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/11/making-weather-english-writing-art-alexandra-harris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/sep/11/making-weather-english-writing-art-alexandra-harris","fields":{"headline":"Making the weather in English writing and art","bodyText":"On the last night of the 18th century, the heroine of Virginia Woolf’s Orlando leans out from her London window. In the cool, clear air she surveys the smooth domes and magnificent vistas of the city. All is “light, order, and serenity”. But then, as she watches, a rapid gloom starts to close in. Within moments, there comes a dramatic meteorological alteration. “A turbulent welter of cloud covered the city. All was darkness; all was doubt; all was confusion. The 18th century was over; the 19th century had begun.” This is how time passes in Woolf’s historical pageant: the atmosphere of English life in different eras is established through changes in the air. It is a masterstroke of literalism. Life changes in accordance with the newly Victorian weather: skirts are worn to the ground and tablecloths follow suit; ivy grows in profusion; in the muffled gloom, evasions and concealments are bred almost as quickly as children. It’s all a joke, of course, but the joke works closely with matters of fact. Immediately we think of wood-panelled rooms, yards of black taffeta, the rain as it comes down in the paintings of John Atkinson Grimshaw, the verdigris of long-weathered copper,the sheen of cobbles in gaslight. Why does the 19th century, seen through the telescope of time, look so very damp? Parts of it were verifiably wet. Springs and autumns in the 1830s and 40s were characterised by high rainfall, as were the summers of the 1870s when crops rotted in the fields. There was also the man-made atmosphere to contend with: industrial smoke generated its own pervasive black clouds. But Victorian England also saw plenty of fine weather and some worrying periods of drought. Measurable quantities of rainfall and cloud-cover were not really, I think, Woolf’s point. Her method in Orlando had more to do with a sense that, as cultural preoccupations change, we find affinities with different conditions. Weathers gather associations and, in a constant exchange of subject and object, these associations shape our experience of weather. Woolf’s sensitivity to cultural change over time came from astonishingly wide and empathetic reading. Five years ago, in an optimistic moment, I wondered if I could observe for myself some of the meteorological shifts she detected. I was not serious about this until I spent a summer reading Anglo-Saxon poetry and chronicles. The fascination with frost seemed to run so deep that even the language was frozen into its forms: wintercearig, winterbiter, wintergeweorþe. Where was the sun? I kept reading, waiting for the spring. It came in the lyric poems of the 13th century: “Lenten is come with love to toune”, they sang. The long hold of ice was over. “Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote”, begins the Canterbury Tales: April is where the medieval stories begin. I knew then that I must read on and on, through into the 15th century, and the 18th (watching to see whether the sky there was so very clear), and on through the gathering clouds towards Wyndham Lewis’s 1914 proposal of a new climate for modern life. It amazed me to realise that there have been times when weather is all allegory, and others when the numbers on a rain gauge count for more than a pantheon of aerial gods; there have been times for meteoric marvels and times for gentle breeze. It’s hard to find a description of a rainy night in the early 1700s, but the Romantics will take a storm, or even just a shower, as fit subject for their most probing meditations. The thermometer may be the same whoever reads it, but our experience of weather is more than statistical. It is made up of personal memories and moods. An evening sky is full of other evenings; a mist may be given its identity by a line from a song or a half-remembered film. The weather is made for us partly by writers and artists who have set down permanently their response to a fleeting effect. This is all interwoven with the practicalities of being hot or cold while the world around us is blotted out or lit up, a brass handle or a shopfront suddenly picked out by the sun. The subject I was chasing through libraries and over windy hills was not the weather itself, I realised, but the weather as it is daily recreated in the human imagination. I kept Orlando in mind: I wanted to experience that sense of time-travel, of changing stages, of England and English skies as if filmed with a time-lapse camera. *** English literature begins in the cold. In the writing of the eighth and ninth centuries, perceptions of winter are expressed with incomparable subtlety. The elegy now known as “The Wanderer” introduces the melancholy figure of an exile who finds himself completely alone in the world, adrift on a “rime-cold” sea and haunted by memories of the life he used to lead. He adopts the austere seascape as the external image of inward feelings which are chilling in themselves and on which he imposes a cool self-discipline. The Wanderer wakes from dreams of company to bleak wastes where seabirds spread their wings through hail and snow. It is a monochromatic vision, with the addition of “fealwe” suggesting the dun yellow of churned water. It is dreadful, but the poet is mesmerised by this cold expanse. This is what he chooses to write about. Other writers are more simply explicit about visual appreciation of cold. In the “Rune Poem” ice is defined by its jewel-like quality. Thinking of it, the poet makes his line glitter – “glisnaþ glæshlutter gimmum gelicust”; icy ground gleams attractively in his mind as a frosted floor which is “fæger ansyne”, fair to see. English summers could be as warm then as now, but Anglo-Saxon writing does not deal in warm Junes or bright Septembers. Perhaps they did not need to be discussed. In winter, the time of stories, easy warmth was an unreal memory. The opposite of cold is usually not summer balminess, but the communal indoor fire. When the sun is mentioned at all, it is known as the “candle of the sky”, a curious image in that it depletes the sun, likening it to melting tallow and vulnerable flame. The impulse of this culture is to favour the controlled, man-made and essentially social space of the hall. Exiles dream not of airy fields but of a dense, smoky interior, where wooden benches are worn smooth and gold catches the light. From the sixth century onwards it was common to hear of holy men who put themselves purposely in the hands of nature at its coldest. When Bede wrote the life of Cuthbert, he paused over an arresting image that clearly meant much to him: the saint’s habit was to pray all night in the sea, up to his arms and neck in water. This was a self-inflicted penance of cold, at the limits of bodily endurance. A fellow monk, wondering where Cuthbert went at night, followed him to the shore. He watched at dawn, Bede tells us, as Cuthbert came out of the water and prayed on the sand, where otters gathered to warm his feet with their breath. We can almost see, in the grey light of a morning on the wide Northumbrian beach, the wet, gleaming fur of the otters, and their breath condensing as it rises. *** The Christian story proposes changeable weather as one of the penalties inflicted on humanity for its sins. In Eden there was moisture to nurture abundant plants, and such warmth that Adam and Eve needed no extra layers. If there was weather at all, it was steadily benign. The trouble began either immediately after the Fall or with the Flood. John Milton in Paradise Lost described the dire “alterations in the heavens and elements” set in train by God as soon as the apple was eaten. Winds were summoned to do battle in the air. Angels tipped the Earth on its axis, subjecting it to the variability of seasons. Man would now have to cope with the unpredictability of a lopsided globe. The twinned genesis of weather and time is remembered in the French phrase les temps and Italian tempo. Having lost eternal stability, we must live in passing airs and hours. At the end of Paradise Lost, Adam and Eve walk tremblingly into a punishing weather-world. The cherubim who gather to escort them are conjured in an evaporating simile that offers a last glimpse of Eden, though one already changed. The angels come towards the outcasts Gliding meteorous, as evening mist Risen from a river o’er the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the labourer’s heel Homeward returning. In this image, which eludes like mist all attempts to catch it, luminescent angels are brought into association with a murky night drawing in over the marshes. “Homeward returning”, writes Milton pointedly, though Adam and Eve now have no home to which they can return as mists gather at their heels. The dank marsh-world they enter will be the fenny breeding ground of English literature. Grendel, the monster of Beowulf, will come stalking down through the mist, apprehended more (and more frighteningly) as a meteorological disturbance than as corporeal flesh and blood. Dickens will turn the “marish” into the shadowy Kent wastes of Great Expectations, which will in turn become the “marsh country” of Graham Swift’s Waterland. Clinging and closing over the earth, the mist will foster sorrows and secrets. But it will have a thousand other moods. In the morning sunlight it will come to be an image of hope in an expansive world. *** Weather has not always been described in vaporously atmospheric terms. For centuries much less attention was paid to rising mists and roving breezes than to discrete “meteors”. The Elizabethan taste in weather was for heraldic suns and tempests that might be rendered in the woodcuts of an emblem book. The air was an arena for the staging of extraordinary events. On the evidence of much Renaissance art and writing one would think that this was a time of incessant storms, comets, frosts and lightning strikes, broken only by the arrival each year of a prodigiously lovely spring. There were dull days in the 16th century. It drizzled as much then as it does today. Yet there is little of this ongoing ordinariness in the weather as it is personified in the masques of Ben Jonson, the frost fairs of Thomas Dekker, the winter nights of Thomas Sackville, the explosive meteorological metaphors that burst out into Marlowe’s theatre. Meteors (meaning any atmospheric phenomena) were the runic alphabet of God. They must be decoded, one by one, and acted on. Year after year through the 17th century, popular broadsides and pamphlets reported “prodigious” events in the sky and called on the nation to repent. Fireballs, brimstones, aerial castles: all seemed to be appearing with such frequency as to suggest the coming of the end. Some believed that the air was writhing with devils. Robert Burton in the 1620s thought that “aerial spirits” could “tear oaks, fire steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain stones, as in Livy’s time, wool, frogs etc., counterfeit armies in the air, strange noises, swords”. Modern astronomers can now confirm that there were unusual numbers of comets around. Historical climatologists tell us that the long-term climatic changes of the little ice age were exacerbated by the frequency of El Niño episodes (20 of them between 1618 and 1669), which brought summer wind and rain to England. On top of this came a decline in sunspot activity. No wonder, then, that weather events are fearful things in the writing of the era. The facts of the weather are clearly important, but the facts can be perceived in different ways, and sensibility matters a great deal here. This was a culture which had been intent on ideas of decay well before the decline in solar energy, and a culture which staged fiery spectacles in theatres and in books even when there was not much to be seen in the sky. It was partly because observers were constantly looking for them that freakish meteors were witnessed in overwhelming numbers. What did people see in the morning when they opened their shutters on a grey Tuesday in the mid-1600s? It seems impossible to know. Modern diarists will often record the weather as a matter of course and as the background to their day. Writers of journals and letters in Stuart England said very little about it. When the weather in the 1660s determined his movements, Samuel Pepys would make a note of it, as on Boxing Day 1661: “It was most foule weather […] and so we went into an alehouse.” He might talk to his wife in bed on long rainy mornings, or doze off on the grass in the sun. Celia Fiennes, hardy traveller that she was, described all her lengthy side-saddle tours of England in the 1680s and 90s with barely a reference to the weather, though she must have been blown about on hilltops day after day. All she saw fit to mention was that Derbyshire was windy, and that after a fierce hailstorm in Cornwall her “dust coate” dried off quickly. This was characteristic of her time. The weather’s absence can be as intriguing as its later omnipresence. It is rare to feel the movement of air in 17th-century writing, though when we do it is with distinctive clarity. The Essex clergyman Ralph Josselin commented regularly on the weather in the weekly (sometimes daily) diary entries he made for nearly 40 years. In late April 1647, he prayed for a let-up in the rain: “The weather was very wett, the season very sad and had continued so very long, I earnestly entreated God for faire weather” – and when fair weather arrived a few days later, he registered his sense of divine goodness. When he wrote about clement days, he was making himself stop and give thanks for them. He was an unusually close watcher of ordinary conditions: “This weeke was wonderfull dull and malincholly weather,” he wrote on Tuesday 31 December 1654, while struggling with a cold and hoping it would not go to his chest. “The sun shone not, but on Monday morning, the 30 a litle glimmering one glance or two.” *** For centuries we have been asking ourselves whether “malincholly” weather really has the power to make us melancholy – and whether we should try to make ourselves immune. Samuel Johnson in the 1750s was stern about those who let the state of the atmosphere govern their tempers. “Our dispositions too frequently change with the colour of the sky,” he wrote, and he condemned it: “Surely nothing is more reproachful to a being endowed with reason, than to resign its powers to the influence of the air, and live in dependence on the weather and the wind.” Johnson set out a manifesto for imperturbable consistency: “Every man, though he may not aspire to Stoicism, might at least struggle against the tyranny of the climate, and refuse to enslave his virtue or his reason to the most variable of all variations, the changes of the weather.” There could be no more paradigmatic statement of the ideals associated with the Age of Reason. Johnson asserted the power of intellect and self-will over mind and body. His promotion of stability over change showed why the weather was never going to be an easy subject in the middle of the 18th century. In a culture which took its bearings from the stable symmetries of classical architecture and from the balanced weights of the poetic couplet, fogs and storms were troublesome. Johnson demanded that the thinking man make himself independent of such uncontrollable forces. This façade of reason, however, was erected on land hard won from emotion. Johnson kept mentioning the weather. In private he noted that the period between Easter and Whitsuntide was “propitious to study” and set himself daunting tasks for this time of year. He tried to train himself to like “invigorating” winter, but he struggled in the cold. Recording his every word, James Boswell noticed that “the effects of weather upon him were very visible”. But why should he be ashamed? Boswell himself was sure that the “influences of the air” were irresistible to people of fine sensibilities. Near the end of his life, Johnson found that he was ready to relent. He had tired of the struggle and he made an admission: “I am now reduced to think, and am at last content to talk, of the weather,” he wrote at the age of 74. “Pride must have a fall.” That was in August 1784. He was ceding way to the next generation, whose veneration of the weather would be its badge of honour, as Johnson’s resistance was his. *** Johnson needed to banish the weather in order to get his work done; JMW Turner could not begin his work without it. Weather was his subject, his studio and (when rain mixed with his paints) his medium too. Envious of its mobile energy, he made the sky his tutor and tried to compete with it. His watercolour on paper must take on the iridescence of mist. Or his oils must become the dark materials of the storm. In November 1810, Turner was working on the terrace at Farnley Hall, in Yorkshire, looking out across Wharfedale towards the slope of Otley Chevin. “Come here!” he shouted suddenly to his friend Walter Fawkes’s son (who would remember this moment all his life). A great disturbance was approaching. “Look at this thunder-storm! Isn’t it grand? Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it sublime?” Quickly he sketched the shape of the oncoming clouds and showed the drawing to the boy beside him: “In two years’ time you will see this again, and call it Hannibal crossing the Alps.” He was true to his word: his Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps, painted on a canvas nearly eight feet wide, was exhibited in 1812. In that storm gathering over Yorkshire, Turner had seen a whole history of power: the history of struggles between man and man, the giant struggle of all men combined against the elements, and the exhilarating imaginative force that the weather can stir in those who watch it. The upward arc of the storm-sturge is a shout of triumph and a leap of the heart. After the storm, there were quiet consolations. Turner kept seeing, all around him, Milton’s Eden, that country of “mists and exhalations”, where, if you watch for long enough, greyness will be lit up with gold. In the dim chill of a rural wayside he watched the slow relief of dawn. His Frosty Morning caught the crackling stillness of a winter sunrise, when the barren landscape softens moment by moment in the tawny glow. Yet in Turner there is always a tacit knowledge of nature’s capacity for elemental violence. Stout castles on the Tweed are to him no more solid than mirages in the distance. The stately homes of his patrons may have the finest classical proportions, but they cannot hold back the flood. Among the most disturbing of his paintings is not a tempest or an avalanche but an interior. The picture now known as Interior of a Great House (c 1830) shows white light surging into an elegant drawing room like an invading force. Mites of dust are caught in its beams. This light has brought with it a whirlwind that lifts the fabric and knocks a footstool on its side. Squinting into the bright shafts and the dim corners we begin to make out a scene of wreckage. Turner does not paint “an interior”, but the ruin of everything for which interiors stand. *** But what is an interior after all? Part of the story of our changing relationship with weather is written into the varying forms of shelter we have built. In Anglo-Saxon, a window had been an “eagduru” – an “eye-door” for looking through. The Norse word “vindauga”, or “wind-eye”, became the more common name, signifying what came in rather than the seeing-out. Windows let in the wind. Medieval houses often faced inwards to a courtyard, closing in on themselves, their walls as thick as possible to withstand the cold and, in violent times, the armies; their windows were chinks in the armour, only grudgingly permitted. The great “prodigy houses” of the 1580s were among the first buildings to embody in glass and stone a new relationship between humans and weather. They turned everything outwards, wearing their lights like diamonds, confronting the visitor not with strong defences but with equally formidable displays of confidence. At Hardwick Hall (“more glass than wall”), a great chamber with floor-to-ceiling glass along one side was a kind of conservatory. By day the whole character of the room was conditioned by the quality of light, the furnishings made pale and uniform in blanket cloud, or sharpened and coloured in sun. From the outside, the walls seemed to be made partly of the sky itself. Grey, blue, shifting clouds – it all passed across the countenance of Hardwick. Our modern glassy office-blocks are descendants of those Tudor halls of mirrors, though large windows now come with automatic blinds and intelligent heat-responsive tinting: architecture’s sunglasses. Twentieth-century interiors often aimed for transparency while being completely independent of the elements outside. They were hermetic capsules of man-made weather. Since Le Corbuiser announced in 1929 that ideally we should breathe “pure air at a constant temperature”, proposing that the homes of the future would be exactly 18C, air-conditioning has regulated the temperature of our lives. But there are signs now of a large-scale return to the air. Draughts are the new sophistication. Windows may be for the wind again, and not only for the eye. Skyscrapers at their translucent best can become part of the atmosphere, reflecting the clouds around them and disguising their own solidity. Reflection is their apology for bulk. The Shard is a sky-mirror stretching up almost 800ft, its glinting walls constructed from “extra white” low iron glass to share the colours of the air. This self-effacement is combined with the gesture of unroofed ambition by which the building claims the endlessness of the sky itself. Such manoeuvres towards airy vastness come naturally to a culture which conducts its most ordinary business via aerial signals. The virtual world of information technology adopts the weather’s terms. Weightless, intangible, and all around us, information forms an additional atmosphere. Our words and music, and our credit-card transactions, are held in a figurative cloud which is cumulus-like in its vast capacity, building and building as the particles of our data coalesce. Storage used to be heavy: there were boxes and filing cabinets. Now our stored information is ethereal. It is at once everywhere and nowhere, though we imagine that it is up in the sky, because that is where our gods have traditionally belonged. *** We have arrived, in the 21st century, at a critical juncture in the story of weather. Unless decisive action is taken very soon, the next generation will see the last of the weather we know. We will have written our own ending to the history of life in a temperate climate which has endured for about 11 millennia. In the years to come, our experience will be determined by memory and association, by the things we have read and looked at, by the places we have been to or imagined. We will draw on the great storehouse we each carry in mind. “Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail?” asked God of Job. “Treasures” here means “treasuries”, places where snow is stored up for future use. The words contain a note of threat: these treasure-stores are armouries, stockpiled with ammunition. At the same time they are luminous, conjuring for a moment what we cannot see: the door of a cupboard swung open to reveal a great gleaming wealth of hail. The weather in that storehouse is beyond the knowledge of Job, who is all of us. But it seems to me that the “treasures of the hail” are also those that have been made by human beings through many centuries. These are forms of man-made weather we need not regret. The treasuries are piled high with songs, poetry and paintings, diary entries, the names we have found for the hail, the mist and the wind. Feste stands alone on stage at the end of Twelfth Night and sings a song about life in the weather and the weathering of life: “When that I was and a little tiny boy, / With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, / A foolish thing was but a toy, / For the rain it raineth every day.” It is sometimes called a “lecher’s progress” because of the bawdy lyrics (thieves, beds and drunkards) that appear among the refrains. It can be sung as a bit of drunken jesting, but more often it is sung in a way which mixes joking with melancholy, because it is both comic and tragic to accept this vision of life. Shakespeare’s feeling for the song is suggested by the context in which it is reprised: Lear’s Fool remembers it in the middle of the storm, as the gale blows and Lear’s wits “begin to turn”. At a point of desperation, when everyone and the sky seem to have gone mad, the Fool remains sanely aware that the wind and the rain have been going on since the world began, and his song quietly proposes that human lives are all versions of the same humdrum effort to make one’s way through the weather. And so it goes on: “He that has and a little tiny wit / With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, / Must make content with his fortunes fit, / For the rain it raineth every day.” Alexandra Harris’s Weatherland: Writers and Artists Under English Skies is published by Thames &amp; Hudson on 14 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2014/jun/16/crowdfunding-invest-cash-risks","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-16T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Crowdfunding proving the perfect match-maker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/16/crowdfunding-invest-cash-risks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jun/16/crowdfunding-invest-cash-risks","fields":{"headline":"Crowdfunding proving the perfect match-maker","bodyText":"Would you help pay for a book to be published that features tales from mums caring for children with life-limiting conditions? This is one of thousands of crowdfunding projects seeking funds. Lives Worth Living is asking for £7,500 on website Crowdfunder to cover costs. In return, you receive a copy of the book or even a page dedication, depending on the amount. The phenomenon of crowdfunding is booming. You can stake from just £10 to emulate the likes of Duncan Bannatyne by becoming a \"mini-dragon\", backing an ever-expanding range of ventures from theatre productions to electronic gizmos. A musical production of The Wind in the Willows is among thousands of projects taking part in the trend, raising £1m earlier this year. But as this craze gains momentum, what are the risks? A wide range of websites have sprung up bringing investors together with projects seeking a cash injection. The Crowdfunding Centre said more than £3,500 per hour is being raised in the UK. Since the beginning of 2014, more than 6,561 projects have been launched. In return for your investment you may be offered a tangible \"reward\", such as tickets to a gig or a T-shirt, an equity stake in the business – or even a share in a buy-to-let. Typically, crowdfunding websites benefit by taking a percentage commission of money raised, at an average of 5%, alongside – sometimes – a slice of returns paid to investors. So check the fine print. The House Crowd says its participants can put from £1,000 down on a buy-to-let property to receive a guaranteed 6% net return per year plus a share of profits on sale. Alternatively, they can opt for a fixed return of 7.5% net a year with no equity in the property. A typical property currently listed is a two-bedroom terrace house in Moston, Manchester, valued at £68,000 after refurbishment. Experts warn that investors should check crowdfunding site credentials carefully. Property expert Henry Pryor says: \"There are many new opportunities and the vast majority will be bonefide operations but potential investors should check just who or what they are before they hand over their money. \"I fear that we are going to find a significant number of hooky sites that will promise you the world, take your money and leave you feeling very stupid.\" The majority of the sites offer warnings stating that investors risk losing their cash if new ventures fail, typically via an online questionnaire. However, some check enterprises more extensively than others. Since April, the sector has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. It says this should stop crowdfunding websites running off with your cash, but it won't prevent a small business you've backed from failing. Christopher Woolard, director of policy, risk and research at the FCA, says: \"We want to ensure that consumers are appropriately protected – but not prevented from investing. The rules provide consumer protection while allowing businesses to continue to have access to this innovative method of funding.\" Here we look at some of the projects on offer. Music, art and films Kickstarter, which originated in the US, offers a massive range of reward-based projects. It opened its doors to British investors in October 2012. The Observer found a staggering 3,381 projects seeking funding, ranging from mobile phone apps and circus performances, to an \"eco\" magazine for kids. It lists the percentage of the total amount sought that has been pledged so far, and how many days there are left to invest. A project has to reach its goal before the deadline, or no money changes hands, and less than 50% make it. The minimum pledge is usually £1 or $1. However, beware that the site \"does not investigate a creator's ability to complete their project\". Among those projects listed as successfully funded is a truck offering \"Good &amp; Proper\" tea to Londoners. This asked for £10 or more in return for a bag of tea, to free hire of the van for a party or wedding if you could stretch to £1,000. It sought a total of £10,000, and successfully raised £14,682. Energy Among the sites that target green–energy are Trillion Fund and Abundance. Trillion Fund launched a new crowdfunding platform last week that enables people to lend directly to renewable energy projects from £50, in return for an income. Typical returns on the site range from 3%-9%, with terms ranging from three to 20 years. Rebecca O'Connor of Trillion Fund says: \"Loan-based renewable energy crowdfunds have more in common with bonds than with equity crowdfunds, because they can come with fixed interest rates over a few years.\" \"Buying an equity stake in an early stage start-up is considered more risky than lending against an operational wind project, for example, because, with the latter, there is historical performance and revenue data. The amount of energy – and therefore revenue – that solar panels and wind turbines generate is relatively predictable, which means funders have a sensible idea of what their returns will be.\" Abundance has crowdfunded £6m of projects so far, with a mix of wind and solar energy in the UK. You can invest as little as £5. You buy debentures, similar to IOUs and, in return, you are paid a share of the profits from generating green energy. The site has three projects open for investment offering a range of fixed and variable returns over 20 years of between 6.75% and 9%. For example, Engynious Schools is seeking £1m to share ownership and returns with private investors from solar panels it owns on 19 schools across the UK. On average, an investor places about £5,800 across three or more projects, according to founder Bruce Davis. Small businesses/start-ups There is a large range of sites.InvestingZone was launched in May 2013, and offers a stake in some early-stage companies. It says it only allows people to invest if they understand the risks. SyndicateRoom, another newer entrant, offers users the chance to \"top up\" large stakes in a business that have been bought by established investors. Seedrs and Crowdcube are among the well-established, both offering a minimum investment of £10. Seedrs rasies an average of £1m each month for start-ups that are struggling to get off the ground, and says it is up to the investor whether they are happy to take the risk on a business they hope will succeed. Some high-profile figures are joining the crowdfunding throng. Fund manager Nicola Horlick attracted £150,000 in just one day last year through Seedrs towards fund management firm Glentham Capital. This success prompted her to launch Money&amp;Co, a crowdfunding website with risk ratings for each business seeking funding. Among other sites, Peoplefund.itand Crowdfunder feature creative enterprises seeking backing in return for rewards. On Indiegogo, you can put money towards political campaigns, humanitarian projects and technology start-ups. Buzzbnk and CrowdBnk also include a variety of projects, from charities to many other businesses. Some sites are more niche. For example, unbound is a crowdfunding website and a publisher, while MoolaHoop exclusively lists business ventures from female entrepreneurs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/energy-provider-pressure-consumers-price-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-24T08:45:00Z","webTitle":"You tell us: what do you want from an energy provider?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/energy-provider-pressure-consumers-price-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/energy-provider-pressure-consumers-price-companies","fields":{"headline":"You tell us: what do you want from an energy provider?","bodyText":"Billy Ahmed, 20, hospitality worker: 'Allow us to roll on bills' I live in a shared house with four other housemates, and sometimes deciding who pays the bills or who's responsible for the direct debit can cause a lot of problems. We just switched our gas and electricity bill from pay as you go to a standing order; on reflection it was much easier before, because at least you didn't have to chase people for money they owe. I haven't noticed the rise in energy prices, but what would be good is if energy companies would allow you to roll on unpaid bills, which might make getting cash out of housemates a bit less stressful. Eleanor May, 23, service industry manager: 'Let's pay monthly' I live in a house with one other person, and it's a nightmare to heat and the bills are enormous. At the moment we're paying our bills quarterly, which isn't something we wanted. We've tried changing it to a monthly, but the energy company won't let us – they said we have to pay either quarterly or every four months. I don't know how much of a difference that makes in terms of price, but it would make things a lot easier for us to budget if we were allowed pay monthly, because it's simpler to work out what we need to save. David Saunders, 64, technology consultant: 'Stop cosying up to power' The way politicians have framed this issue doesn't help. The problem is that despite supposedly having a free market, energy bosses and MPs still like to cosy up to one another. Also, energy prices are going to be the last thing people worry about when we inevitably reach the stage when water is becoming scarce. Regardless, this talk about nationalisation of energy doesn't help – it comes from all over the world. One novel solution to the political issue would be to start counting spoilt votes, to see just how disenfranchised we are with our elites. But with regards to the energy issue? We're at the mercy of large corporations, and they're even more impenetrable than small governments. Marie Bridges, 40, educationalist: 'Pick up the telephone' My main issue is that when you have a problem with your gas or electricity service or have a query about your bill, you can never speak to someone directly about it. I know call centres are part and parcel of the modern age, but I don't find it reassuring that when I need to speak to someone, often you end up discussing it with someone who has no expertise. Also it would be good if more was done to utilise green energy, such as wind farms or solar energy – anything to keep the cost of the bills down. Michelle Kirana Oh, 26, designer: 'Keep offering a cheap fixed price' I rent my own business premises with other people and the gas bill is always pretty cheap. It's never more than £30 a month, so that's fine. And the bill for my flat that I share with my boyfriend is usually about £44 a month, so again, that's fairly affordable. Our home is relatively new and has few rooms, so this could be why it's so inexpensive. Nonetheless, we haven't really felt the pinch of rising energy costs. When they went up last year, we changed to a lower fixed tariff, which we're tied to for 12 months. But it's cheaper than what we were paying before, so we're happy. Rasha Kahil, 34, magazine editor: 'Don't underestimate estimates' I share a flat with two friends, and last winter it was so cold and we were so fed up of splitting bills that we switched to an estimated flat rate for that quarter, and just left it at that. When the actual bill arrived, it was considerably more than what we'd paid as an estimate, leaving me with a shortfall in cash. It's annoying. Our flat is in London and these expensive energy prices feel like just another punitive tax for living in the capital alongside rent prices, travel cards and living costs. Phil Johnstone, 27, researcher: 'Keep investing in gas' The plan to solve the energy crisis with new nuclear power stations seems misguided. It doesn't look like they're going to go online until 2023, and similar models being built in Europe have gone vastly over budget. Moreover, they haven't generated the energy they were expected to so, inevitably, we're going to need more gas anyway. Paul McGuinness, 30, legal aide: 'Set out a Scottish offer' Our energy bills just keep getting more and more expensive. Our last quarterly bill for gas and electricity was £250. I'm from Ireland but I live in Glasgow, and all the houses I've lived in here seem to have had huge, single-pane windows and been poorly insulated. Energy prices would therefore be something that might encourage me to vote in the Scottish independence referendum, if one of the parties were to begin explicitly addressing this issue. At the moment I don't intend to vote because I don't consider it's my place, but this issue might sway me – and other voters who are unsure.

The city is rapidly running out of energy, as government, opposition and private suppliers all bicker about who is to blame. In the past two years, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has hiked power rates four times, by a whopping 26%, and another hike is expected, despite the fury of consumers. Meanwhile, many beleaguered Delhi residents suffer eight-hour-long power cuts in 45 degree summer heat. With local elections coming up in November, Chief Minister Sheila Dixit has been quick to shove the blame on to private distribution companies (known as \"discoms\"). The chief minister even wrote an angry letter to business tycoon Anil Ambani, the head of Reliance Infrastructure, which owns two of Delhi's biggest discoms. Somewhat belatedly, she directed him to fix the power crisis and ensure all-day electricity. Dixit admitted she was \"shocked' to learn that the discoms owe dues amounting to nearly Rs 33 billion to the government (about £375 million). But the government is no hapless innocent, claim opposition parties. Maverick activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal has alleged that the Delhi government is colluding with discoms to fudge losses, line their pockets and pass on costs to the consumers. The opposition Bhartiya Janata Party is also calling for an inquiry into the financial mismanagement of the discoms and demanding intervention by the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, as the government muddles along, green campaigners point out that Delhi has completely ignored other solutions. A recent report by Greenpeace India revealed Delhi's miserable failure to attain renewable energy targets. Delhi actually achieved less than 1% of its target, making it the worst performer amongst 22 states, despite being by far the wealthiest. Part of the problem, says report author and senior Greenpeace campaigner Abhishek Pratap, is Delhi's cossetted status. \"As the capital, Delhi gets 75% of its energy from coal plants in other states. This has made the city complacent, and slow to consider other alternatives. The DERC does not even have a proper policy for renewable energy,\" he points out. The report also pointed out the growing inequity between rural and urban areas. Delhi consumes double the national average of electricity, while poorer states such as Bihar go short. Coal guzzling also comes at a huge environmental cost for the city, and the country, with India now on the brink of a public health crisis. \"This report is an indictment of the whole policy framework around renewables and the dismissive attitude of the government towards it,\" wrote Pratap in a stinging foreword, \"Renewable power could have been a tool to bridge the demand-supply gap in the energy sector across the country. But the toothless mechanism combined with unambitious targets has failed to give any impetus to renewables in India.\" Now, Delhi is belatedly scrambling for alternatives. Greenpeace believes solar energy is a good alternative for Delhi, given its nearly 350 sunny days a year. \"People think solar energy needs a lot of land, but Delhi has plenty of roof space. It's not a vertical city like Mumbai; it's a radial city,\" says Pratap. Currently, no subsidies exist for solar users, and ignorance about solar alternatives means that very few Delhi households actually consider solar options. But things may be changing. On June 3, Sheila Dixit opened a new solar project. \"Our country is endowed with abundant natural sunshine. For our electricity needs, we should look towards the sun,\" said Dixit. These platitudes have been heard before though; about two years ago there was much talk about a renewable energy policy, but little action. But this time around, with desperate times calling for desperate measures, Pratap expects some progress. Greenpeace is meeting with government officials this week to talk about a viable renewable energy policy, with incentives and support for discoms, and punitive measures to ensure compliance. Meanwhile, it has just launched a new campaign to mobilise public support for solar energy. \"Delhi cannot depend on coal for energy any more, nor can it look to other states. If it does not consider renewable energy, the city will run out of power very soon,\" says Pratap. Ominous words. Is the Delhi government - and its public - listening?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/small-world/2013/aug/28/fashion-nanotechnology-iphone-charger-cornell","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-28T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Move over Milan, hello Cornell | Rachael Stubbins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/small-world/2013/aug/28/fashion-nanotechnology-iphone-charger-cornell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/small-world/2013/aug/28/fashion-nanotechnology-iphone-charger-cornell","fields":{"headline":"Move over Milan, hello Cornell","bodyText":"On 5 September, fashion designers at New York fashion week will kick off the spring-summer 2014 season, giving us a glimpse of the upcoming trends. But head to the nanotech lab at Cornell University, and you can see the trends for the next decade or more. Here, researchers are bring the latest science to bear on the world of clothes. Professor Juan Hinestroza, a chemical engineer at Cornell University, set up the textile nanotechnology laboratory to explore the interface between materials science and fashion. The designers in his research team are fashion students who learn some basic chemistry at his lab and develop new uses of nanotechnology for the fashion industry. He regrets that scientists usually stick to the lab while designers stay in their studios, rather than working together to create innovative products for a new generation of buyers. \"We do a lot of basic science but then we combine it with the talent of designers so we can change the perspective of science – by paying more attention to the consumer,\" he said. \"We train our fashion designers and scientists to see that the possibilities are not restricted to the materials you find in the store – you can make your own.\" Over the past seven years, the group has produced five prototypes inspired by nanoscience, including a dress that is able to charge an iPhone, clothes that repel stains and fight off allergies and a mask that captures toxic gases in the air. Jen Keane was the design student who worked with Professor Hinestroza on the gas mask back in 2010. \"What really struck me about this project was the idea of trying to find a use for a material that also has a function. The technology is great but if it doesn't actually do anything for the consumer, they're not going to wear it.\" The fabric used in the mask was able to catch gases because the cotton fibres were attached to molecules known as metal-organic framework molecules (MOFs) that had been altered at the nanoscale to act like cages. The gases it traps could be anything from carbon monoxide from car exhaust pipes to constituents of cigarette smoke, but the military was interested in its ability to capture toxic fumes such as mustard gas. As the only designer in the team, Keane's job was to work out how to turn these little scraps of cotton fibres into something that could be worn. She said that working with these materials was far more challenging than normal fashion design since the aim was not just to create something that looked beautiful. There were more limitations, too. The modified fabric retained its natural characteristics – except for the colour. \"We didn't have a choice in the colour; they formed it using copper molecules which reflected back this brilliant blue-green colour. It had an almost tie-dye look. We couldn't do anything to change it so I just had to embrace it. This colour in real life is really hard to achieve, so it was really interesting that the new fabric just happened to show this colour that would never fade.\" She found these restrictions inspiring. \"You can't really break any boundaries with design unless you really understand the limitations,\" she said. As a designer, I'd expected her to talk about the aesthetic importance of texture and colours, but she said that in order to fully appreciate different materials, you need to know that behind the texture there are nanostructures, and behind the colour there's the chemistry. She said that knowing how a material will drape comes about through understanding how its fabric properties are put together. If you understand the basics of what cotton fibre looks like compared to wool or polyester when you're designing a garment, you can better predict how it will behave. \"New textiles will be the future of design,\" she said. \"The apparel industry is completely driven by textile innovation. You can engineer a lot into the garment and the fit, but in the end, it's made up of fabrics.\" But even in clothing companies, design is still often separate from the development and research departments, which seems odd since the researcher needs to visualise and understand the end use of the product, while the designer needs to understand how it works. \"Within the industry there are still some barriers between scientists and designers, but I also see more of an openness towards collaboration,\" said Keane. \"Before, you had your paintbrush or your [scientific] research, but now they're coming together. The world is changing. It's not quite as black and white as it used to be. I think we need people who are able to speak both science and design. We need to mediate and try to bring the best of both worlds together; I think that's going to be the way of the future.\" The newest fashion student to join the team is Rae Dagdagan, who will start designing new clothes using nanoscience-inspired materials and ideas in the autumn. So if you really want to get ahead of the trends, forget Milan and get yourself a ticket to Cornell's annual fashion show in the spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/02/uturn-on-solar-energy-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-02T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: Government U-turn needed on solar energy tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/uturn-on-solar-energy-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/02/uturn-on-solar-energy-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Government U-turn needed on solar energy tariffs","bodyText":"The UK really has given up on solar renewables and other renewables will follow if the government does not rethink changes to subsidies (Subsidy cuts could kill solar industry, ministers are warned, 1 November). Feed-in tariffs for small- and medium-scale solar photovoltaic developments could be cut as early as December, reducing the incentives to land and home owners. Tariffs would be cut by more than 50% for all solar systems fitted to existing buildings that generate between 4kW and 50kW. This is the second major blow for the UK solar industry this year, following the cut in tariffs for commercial PV systems over 50kW in March. Yet if we are to move Britain toward a low-carbon economy and create new jobs we still need significant investment in small- and large-scale renewable developments. Many investors have backed renewables, and solar in particular, solely on the basis that the feed-in income is guaranteed for 25 years. This second significant change to the tariff has halted many important CO2 saving projects and has undermined the low-carbon industry's confidence about investing in the UK. Jon Abbatt ADAS UK • Simon Jenkins (Comment, 2 November) writes about the need to put money into creating jobs in the productive economy. Perhaps Chris Huhne will read it and think again about last weekend's decision to slash the feed-in tariff for small-scale solar panel installations . The industry agrees that the tariff should regress in line with falling costs, but the scale of the cut will bring to a screeching halt a successful policy to stimulate the take-up of renewables and puts at risk jobs in one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy. In Haringey it will wreck our plans to install £15m worth of panels across our estates, which would have doubled London's solar generation capacity and brought jobs and placements to an area in London topping the unemployment league tables. The government needs to stop moving the goal posts if it wants to create the stable conditions that will attract serious long-term private investment. The European courts have already ruled the feed-in tariff needn't sit on the public expenditure accounts. The Tories said they would be the greenest government ever – that claim is now risible. If it really wants to create a thriving green economy, the government should think again and stay the course on renewable subsidies.

The research shows that Google, which sells its data center services to businesses, has been the most ambitious by buying wind energy that is then injected into the local electric grids where it runs data centers. Microsoft started to do the same last year when it agreed to buy power from a wind farm in Texas. Amazon and Oracle, on the other hand, earned poor grades from Greenpeace for not showing a willingness to use clean energy for their data centers. For companies that can't afford to build their own data centers, there are growing options to choose data center service providers that count clean power as part of their marketing efforts, according Greenpeace. In the report, Clicking clean: how companies are creating the green internet, Greenpeace creates a \"clean energy index\" based on data from companies or otherwise publicly available information. The index reflects how much clean energy, on average, a company uses to power its data centers. The growth of cloud computing While the Greenpeace report highlights several American companies that have committed to using renewable energy such as wind and solar, European data centers that already run on 100% clean power are working hard to woo customers with its eco-friendly credibility. Iceland-based GreenQloud, for one, is setting up its first data center in the US near Seattle. It picked that location for the ability of its local utility, Seattle City Light, to deliver roughly 95% of its electricity from renewable sources, most of which comes from hydropower, said Jon Thorgrimur Stefansson, CEO at GreenQloud. The company, founded in 2010, plans to start running its US data center before the end of May. Back at home, hydropower and geothermal energy run GreenQloud's two data centers. The firm manages servers and hosts websites and other operations for companies that don't want the trouble of managing their own computers and data storage. This type of service is called cloud computing, which has gained popularity because it removes the need for a business to put up the big money to buy servers and software and manage them internally. The growth of cloud computing, which means the number of data centers will climb, also means its service providers could face increasing pressure from customers to reduce their carbon footprint and use less dirty power. That's certainly the case in Europe, which is setting out to cut 20% of its energy use - compared to the 2005 levels - by 2020. European Union policy makers are fretting over whether they can reach that goal, given the growing use of data centers to run an increasingly digitized world. European companies are leading the pack GreenQloud isn't alone in touting its green power credibility. A number of other European data center service providers tout their use of renewable electricity, such as Green Mountain Data Centre and Fjord IT, both in Norway. Iceland and Norway are two popular places for building data centers. Hydropower is a primary source of electricity there, and the Nordic climate provides some natural means for cooling the servers. The US lacks the policy mandate that makes renewable energy use and emission reductions priorities for the information technology service providers and their customers. \"In the US, it's more about social pressure or pressure from environmental organizations such as Greenpeace that is pushing companies to use sustainable energy,\" Stefansson said. GreenQloud has about 2,000 customers from the US, many of which are universities, companies in the healthcare field and individuals, he added. The US uses the most power to run data centers, followed by Japan, the UK and Germany, according to the Greenpeace report. Stefansson noted that less than 20% of the electricity used by most of the cloud computing service providers globally come from renewable sources. Peer pressure Aside from Greenpeace, efforts by Google and other tech companies to buy more renewable electricity also have forced their peers to consider doing the same. Texas-based Rackspace, for example, is looking for opportunities to buy clean power for any of its nine data centers worldwide, said Melissa Gray, Rackspace's senior director of sustainability. Until now, Rackspace has been reducing its carbon footprint by buying credits that are connected to each renewable energy project and sold to generate an additional revenue for its owner. The method is popular and takes less time and money than signing power purchase agreements, which require contract negotiations with power producers and a long-term commitment - around 20 years in some cases - to pay for the electricity. Greenpeace is pushing tech companies to buy green power rather than credits and to do so in regions where they run their data centers. The idea is to replace power from coal or natural gas power plants with cleaner energy at the local electric grids. Usually, a company that buys wind or solar energy doesn't receive the electricity directly from the power plant, which could be miles away and is set up to pipe electricity into the grid. While using green power may appeal to Rackspace's customers, it's not a deal breaker. \"I don't know if I have a customer who directly asks me about renewables in order to close a deal,\" Gray said. \"Most of them expect us to deliver a strategy that will ensure the delivery of renewables.\" Ucilia Wang is a California-based freelance journalist who writes about technology and the environment.

The €210m (£179m) Ashegoda windfarm consists of 84 hi-tech turbines towering above an arid region where villagers herd cattle and ride donkey-drawn carts as they have for generations. The project, outside Mekelle in Tigray state, about 475 miles north of the capital, Addis Ababa, has a capacity of 120MW and will produce about 400m KWh a year. It was completed in phases over three and a half years and has produced 90m KWh for the national grid. The farm, inaugurated by Desalegn on Saturday, was supervised by German company Lahmeyer International and implemented by France's Vergnet with French funding. But the Ethiopian government insisted there were also local spin-offs. \"The project has provided very important experience-sharing for Ethiopia's national companies, who have been involved in the construction of civil works such as geotechnical investigations, roads, turbine foundations, sub-station erection and electro-mechanical erection works,\" it said. Media reports in 2011, however, noted that about 700 farmers had lost some or all their land to make way for the turbines. They were given financial compensation but some complained the money was too little. Ethiopia aims to become the region's leading producer of renewable energy. In the past two years it has built two smaller wind farms near Adama, south-east of Addis Ababa, with a capacity of 51MW each. It urgently needs new energy to feed economic growth that has averaged more than 10% over the past decade. Power cuts are still a regular occurrence in major cities and about half the country still has no access to mains electricity. The government plans to build a \"climate resilient\" economy by 2025 (pdf), with adequate energy even if hydro power runs short because of reduced rainfall. A study by Chinese firm Hydrochina confirmed the high potential for wind power in the northern and southern parts of Ethiopia, particularly in the Somali region, with a huge estimated wind energy potential of 1.3m MW, according to Reuters. Ruth Mhlanga, a climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace Africa, welcomed the Ashegoda windfarm development. \"We need an increase in renewable energy access on the continent, so the fact Ethiopia is investing is really good,\" she said, adding a cautionary note that measures are needed to ensure the use of more local manufacturing and expertise. More than two-thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is without electricity, and more than 85% of those living in rural areas lack access. In June, Barack Obama announced a $7bn (£4.33bn) initiative to double access, citing the potential to develop clean geothermal, hydro, wind and solar energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
