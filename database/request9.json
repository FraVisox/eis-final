It is called Solar Home Energy (not Solar Energy). This has been corrected. Philip Pullman, Oxfordshire I am naturally concerned about climate change and our energy use, and it occurred to me that there is a roof on our house which is completely invisible from the road, and which faces south-west, so would be perfect for solar panels. (To heat water rather than generate electricity, by the way: I'm not entirely convinced that photovoltaic panels are all that effective yet, but as soon as they are I shall slap them up too. Water-heating panels, on the other hand, seem solidly based.) So we spoke to the council about putting panels up and they said immediately that we could forget it because this is a grade II-listed building. And then this energy company, Solar Home Energy, tried again, but about 10 days ago we got a letter from the council saying it was highly unlikely that consent would be granted. The letter did not give a reason, but the reason was obviously the fact that the house is listed. This just seems crazy to me: anything to do with a listed building has priority over everything else. If my house was a beautiful half-timbered Tudor building, I could understand it, but it is just an ordinary farmhouse and these are temporary, fully removable panels, being put on the roof in a position people would have to be invited into my garden to see. The man across the road from me has actually got solar panels on his roof: luckily for him, his house is not listed. My impression is that the council has got a set of guidelines and it is sticking rigidly to those, and it doesn't even occur to it that there are more urgent and recent considerations that should override them. There are these two sets of guidelines coming into conflict, and the wrong ones are trumping the right ones, as it were. There is just no indication of any awareness of the problem of climate change and the need to do something about it. I feel I have an individual responsibility, but at the same time putting in low-energy light bulbs or flying as little as possible - as I do now - will make not one atom of difference. This problem can really only be dealt with by the government, and I have absolutely no faith that the craven liars who are in power now will do anything at all. In my pessimistic moments, I think we are all heading for a catastrophe in which the planet is just going to slough off about five billion of us. In my better moments, I remember other things I was worried about that just went away. Miles Rich, Dorset I was in the army for a long time - I am retired now - and I have always been convinced that if you can heat water for free, you would be stupid not to take advantage of it. We've got solar water heating panels on our roof that I built about 30 years ago (and got pay-back from after 10 years) and this year I became interested in putting in photovoltaic cells. The plan was to install 10 panels on our garage roof. I knew about the government's Low Carbon Buildings Programme grants (www.lowcarbonbuildings.org.uk) and worked out that if I got one it would mean I could just afford it. I got in touch with Sunpowered Energy Systems, who were very good. They said the new grant allocation system was all online now. The man I was dealing with came over to help with our grant application on March 1 because I am in my 70s, and don't have much experience with the internet. We started at 8.30am, because at 9am the monthly allocation of grant applications was set to be released on a first-come, first-served basis. However, there were problems with my connection and we couldn't get into the website. Then it emerged that the postcode I had been using for the past 30 years was not correct. And by 10.20 all the grants had gone. It was maddening. If all the allocations can go in an hour and a half, then either the system does not give enough time to get to it, or there is not enough money. As a result, I have had to call the plan off. The grants for April have been cut, so even if we did succeed next month we would be £2,000 short. I believe that everyone needs to do their bit about global warming. It is frustrating to have been thwarted by this stupidity. Greg Manning, Aberdeenshire Since 1983, I have been living out in the middle of nowhere, in an old farmhouse, which we have now converted to tourist cottages. We have always been pretty green - we have got a wood-burning stove, and we have had solar water heating panels for about seven years. This year, I decided to put in a wind turbine. There are plenty of these turbines in Aberdeenshire; I can think of three in our area. When I put in the planning application in January this year, with the help of Joe Brown at Energy Renewed, I thought it would just be rubber-stamped. But it came back, not from the planning officers - they have been quite helpful - but from the environmental health department, which decided it wanted some noise data. The document it sent me is from the Department of Trade and Industry, and is about the assessment and rating of noise from wind farms. But I am not starting a wind farm - I just want to put up one turbine. And the manufacturer does not have this data, because no other department in the country has ever asked for it. And the cost of getting the data will be about £25,000, because you need to take measurements at specific wind speeds and specific heights, for specific amounts of time. My nearest neighbour is 500 yards away, but the department is concerned about the occupants of the holiday cottages, even though they are probably coming because we are known for being green, and they are hardly going to be surprised to see a turbine. So my application is stuck in the pending tray until the department changes it mind or the data materialises. The Scottish Executive and the government bang on about being green, but then you get something like this. Something has to be done to unblock the system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2006/sep/20/art.culture","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-20T10:48:37Z","webTitle":"Another view: Michael Dickson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/20/art.culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/20/art.culture","fields":{"headline":"Another view: Michael Dickson","bodyText":"Observation, measurement, invention and experiment are the key skills of any good engineer, and that's as true now as it was in Leonardo's time. In that respect, Leonardo is an example to us, but I wouldn't call him an engineer, partly because I don't think he had a formal knowledge of structural mechanics. I'd call Newton an engineer - Leonardo was truly a wonderful inventor. It all starts with intense observation, and that's very clear in the exhibition. I think he had a remarkable ability to watch and draw exactly what he saw, in proportion, very quickly. And then he would think about why it looked right, or didn't look right. I think he instinctively understood the nature of equilibrium. All the sketches that relate to the making of things are drawn to scale, whether you're looking at the flow of water through a sluice, or the pulley systems that he uses to open up a mountain in his stage spectacles. They're all, in his mind, a reality of action. That's fascinating. It comes from an acute sense of measurement - not in the pedantic sense but simply an appreciation of scale, and the relationship of all parts to the whole. They're blueprints. I suppose that's why he is so secretive in the mirror-writing that goes with them: they are patentable objects. The pages of his codexes are crammed with ideas. There's such a range of invention. His mind is working on parallel themes at the same time, and because he draws so exquisitely, he commits an idea to the page as it occurs to him. So, you might get a study of a convex mirror that harnesses solar energy to boil water next to a calculation of the volume of a pyramid. When I teach engineering students I refer to drawing as thought, and it seems to me that Leonardo is the apogee of that. He's using his incredible skills as a draughtsman to think through problems. Because he has a base in Aristotle and Archimedes, he can call instinctively on that knowledge. He didn't know any of the structural mechanics introduced by Robert Hooke and Newton, but he did have a very acute sense of the centre of gravity of objects. It's clear that he realised from his studies of humans that if you didn't have the centre of gravity in the right place, it wouldn't look right. There are so many ideas in the exhibition that it's hard to pick a favourite, but I loved the stage design for the opening of Pluto's mountain. The concept of these counterweights and pulleys that peel back the mountain to reveal its innards - that's an incredible sketch.

Climate change is a result of the rich world's inability to live sustainably and, as with the ozone hole, we in the developing world suffer the worst consequences. The average European emits 9,000kg of CO2 a year, the average American emits 22,000kg and the average African emits about 1,000kg. This means that while the rich world must decrease its average CO2 emissions drastically, we Africans are entitled to increase ours moderately as we pull ourselves out of poverty. We are the forest, you are the factory, so why should we be penalised for your smoke? I help to run Bulungula Lodge, a community-owned lodge in one of the poorest, most remote amaXhosa villages in South Africa. The village has no school, no clinic, no road, no electricity, no shop, no piped water and no toilets. The lodge runs on solar energy, uses compost toilets and recycles its grey water through a lush banana circle. It offsets CO2 emissions from its vehicles by planting 50 slow-growing forest trees per year and we will soon offer guests the opportunity to offset their airplane emissions by planting three trees of their own. The lodge, located in the heart of the village on a stunning beach, offers comfortable accommodation in traditional Xhosa rondawels with an eclectic atmosphere where guests can socialise with the local people. The community not only jointly owns the lodge, but also runs the activities that allow guests to immerse themselves in the cultural and natural environment: you can walk through the forests with a herbalist learning about traditional medicines; ride horses on the beach; canoe up the Xhora river; or just hang out at the local shebeen, where the traditional umqombothi beer never runs out. More than 40 jobs have been created by the lodge and associated businesses, which include guided hiking, village cultural tours, a solar restaurant, honey projects, a nursery, a low-pressure, drip-irrigated veggie farm supplying the lodge, guided fishing, and craft-making. This means that almost half the families in the village have moved on from subsistence farming and now have an income (and thus money for medicines and other essentials). If this lodge were to close, the only other realistic source of income for local people would be the rich titanium deposits found on the beaches and primary dunes of this coastal paradise. The mining companies have already begun tempting communities with lucrative deals. I believe the fair way to attribute CO2 emissions generated by holiday travel is to \"give\" them to the destination country. In South Africa, we have 1 million foreign tourists flying here annually, each emitting about 2,300kg of CO2 in the process. When divided by our 45 million population this would raise our average emissions by a mere 51kg per person per year. It would be utter hypocrisy to demand that South Africa reduce its average emissions by 51kg a year when Africa is by far the least polluting continent on Earth, and in the process destroy its tourism economy creating widespread poverty. Instead of increasing our emissions by building factories, we prefer to fly tourists to our continent. You wouldn't dispute our right to build a factory, so why complain about these flights? This isn't \"creative\" accounting, this is fair accounting. Yes, cancel your holidays to Europe, Australia and the US, countries that have grown rich off climatic destruction/ industrialisation. Cancel your business trips (use video conferencing) and holidays to the rich world (by train, plane or bus), and save up for a worthwhile holiday to the developing world. Your CO2 emissions are on us!

Food shortages, the credit crisis, escalating oil prices, a melting Arctic ice cap and the failure of the Doha trade negotiations: one or all of these issues could be the harbingers of profound change for our global civilisation. And just 16 months from now, in December 2009 in Denmark, humanity will face what many argue is its toughest challenge ever: to agree the fundamentals of a climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol. It all seems to have happened so quickly. Just two years ago we received warning of an imminent disaster - a climatic shift that \"could easily be described as hell: so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive\". The Cassandra was no deep green fundamentalist, but James Lovelock, the acclaimed scientist, pro-nuclear advocate and past adviser to Margaret Thatcher, who, 27 years earlier, had surprised the scientific community with his book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP). At a time when reductionist science (which breaks down the world into small units in order to understand it) prevailed, Lovelock took the opposite approach, describing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, whose function can be disturbed by human activities. It became one of the most influential books of the 20th century. In The Revenge of Gaia (Penguin), published in August 2006, the 86-year-old Lovelock concluded that \"we have unknowingly declared war on Gaia\", and that our only hope of rescue lies in a massive deployment of nuclear energy. The book found a wide readership, yet it failed to mobilise humanity to swift action. His nuclear solution instead divided environmentalists, and the bleakness of his vision was difficult to bear. And again his science went against conventional wisdom, for the most widely accepted assessment of future climate change at the time indicated that his bleak outcome was only a remote possibility. Other, more conventional readings of our climatic future became available in 2006, the most influential of which was Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. His computer presentation, which became both a successful movie and a bestselling book, opens with dramatic footage of collapsing ice shelves, melting glaciers and hurricane damage, then goes on to catalogue deleterious changes in ecosystems as diverse as tundra and coral reefs. If Lovelock diagnosed Gaia as having a fever, then Gore laid out the symptoms detail by detail. His examples were drawn primarily from refereed scientific publications in the world's leading journals, backed up with personal anecdotes from many of the scientists involved. My own book The Weather Makers (Penguin) draws on the same body of data, as does the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and countless other books and articles written at the time. An Inconvenient Truth was fundamental to the great climatic awakening that occurred late in 2006. I have no doubt that in years to come whole books will be devoted to analysing this shift in global public sentiment, which occurred between mid-August and late September. It is exceedingly rare that a film or book makes such a profound impact, yet An Inconvenient Truth marked the moment when the fossil-fuel industry and its political pawns lost their decades-long grip on public opinion, and perhaps inevitably Gore - who had been Clinton's vice-president and had won the popular vote in the most divisive election in recent US history, only to be denied the presidency by the supreme court - was excoriated in the rightwing press. It was as if the bitter race for the presidency had spilled out into climate science. I was lecturing at universities in middle America in 2007 when Gore and the IPCC were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. The naked anger and cynicism - at everything from Gore to peace prizes and Norwegians in general - were frightening. There are dangers in summarising complex science in a 90-minute presentation. Gore was excoriated for explaining that many glaciers are melting - faster indeed than any climatic model predicts - but failing to mention that a very few are growing. Furthermore, his explanation of the causes of climatic change in the geological past was of necessity simple, as was his narrative of contemporary climate change. Both result from a complex interaction of factors, as is well illustrated by the relationship between global warming and hurricane activity. After An Inconvenient Truth was published, researchers discovered that only around half of the increase in global hurricane activity could be directly attributed to an increase in Earth's average temperature. None of this, in my opinion, detracts from the veracity of Gore's exposition. Few books about climate change have been written by the meteorologists and atmospheric physicists that dominate the field. One charming exception is Willi Dansgaard's memoir Frozen Annals (Niels Bohr Institute, 2005). Dansgaard's involvement with climate science goes back to 1947, when he was sent to northwestern Greenland by the Danish weather service. Much of his life has been spent on the Greenland ice cap, drilling, retrieving and analysing the ice cores that provide the key to our understanding of past changes in climate. His book is surprisingly funny and tender, and makes obvious how hard-won is our basic knowledge of climate science. The first attempt at sampling the Greenland ice involved cutting pieces from bergs - an extremely hazardous practice that almost cost Dansgaard his life. While cutting into one, he writes, \"with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off. Fortunately, I fell on to the main part of the chunk, but now it started turning round so I ended up in the water . . . I began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice. There was none . . . I was not afraid of being so close to drowning, but of deserting Inge and our two kids, and I was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance.\" Just \"at that moment a true miracle occurred\" - the arrival of a \"rowboat sent out from Klaushavn\". A critical advance occurred in 1964, when an American-Danish collaboration began at Camp Century, perched high on the Greenland ice cap. The \"camp\" was a massive series of tunnels gouged in the ice, its facilities powered by a nuclear reactor. Spawned of the cold war, the facility had been envisaged as the first stage of a monstrous instrument of conflict, involving the sequestering of 600 nuclear missiles in 4,000km of tunnels. To support it, a city for 11,000 people was to be built inside the mighty ice cap - one of the most hostile and remote environments on Earth. The military planners, however, had failed to remember that ice flows, which means that tunnels and caverns drilled in it soon become hopelessly distorted. Camp Century was destined to play a very different role, for it was here that the first deep drilling into the Greenland ice cap occurred. Dansgaard conveys beautifully what it was like to work in such a bizarre environment, along with the wonders revealed when analysing that core - the discovery of evidence for the little ice age, the medieval warm period, and the great ice age that covered northern Europe and North America. Then, at the very bottom - 1.4km down - the researchers found evidence of a distant time when Earth was slightly warmer than it is today. They had, they realised, pierced right through the 100,000 years of a full glacial cycle - an entire ice age - and had come out the other side into a world that existed 130,000 years ago. It was a triumph they hardly dared hope for. Elucidating the cyclical nature of past changes in climate was the first great achievement of the ice-cap drilling project. One of the more striking cycles they discovered was a rapid warming that occurred every 1,500 years or so throughout the past 100,000 years. These oscillations between warm and cold conditions are now known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events. A sophisticated understanding of the great climatic cycles has permitted a new approach to the climate problem that finds its closest parallel in the \"wiggle matching\" used by stock-market analysis. William Ruddiman is a climatic historian whose book Ploughs, Plagues and Petroleum, published by Princeton in 2005, uses this approach to identify evidence of human impact on the climate system, by identifying precisely where we are in the current cycle and comparing the trend with earlier ones. We are, he explains, 12,000 years into a cooling phase which, judging from previous cycles, should continue for tens of thousands of years more. Instead the world is warming. But what is most remarkable about Ruddiman's work is the evidence it provides for an initial disruption to the climate system that occurred long before the industrial revolution - around 8,000 years ago. It was then, at the dawn of agriculture, that the \"wiggle\" of the current cycle first departed from earlier patterns - for instead of cooling, Earth's average temperature remained remarkably stable. Ruddiman thinks that this was caused by carbon and methane being released into the atmosphere from early agriculture and the destruction of forests. In his account, human activity and the great cycles struck a delicate balance that allowed the flowering of civilisations. He also sees evidence in the ice cores for the consequences of the Black Death (a drop of around two parts per million of CO2 as forests grew over abandoned fields, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere), as well as other historic events. Aspects of his work remain highly contentious, yet I believe that Ruddiman's realisation that the gaseous composition of Earth's atmosphere is an exquisitely sensitive barometer of changes to life itself represents a great breakthrough. Now that the majority of politicians, industry leaders and the public are convinced there is a climate problem, the focus is on what to do. The most influential assessments of the problem's scale are doubtless those of the IPCC, whose projections of various outcomes form the basis of global negotiations and national action plans. One of the most influential of these projections concerns the extent to which Earth's surface will warm over the next century. The lower bound is 1.4°C; the upper bound is 5.8°C. This is an extraordinary range of possible impacts - 1.4°C poses some threat, but 5.8°C is widely recognised as sufficient to induce a Lovelockian Ragnarok. The chance of either outcome, according to the IPCC, is small - less than 10%, and so political dialogue has come to concentrate on the mid-range of the projections. The moment of truth will arrive in December 2009, in Copenhagen, when the world's political leaders will come together to decide the basis of a new global treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol. It's no overstatement to say that the Copenhagen protocol, as it may well come to be known, will play a large role in deciding the fate of humanity. It will come into force in 2012, and if it fails to deliver we'll have to wait until 2020 for a replacement. That will be too late. A number of recent publications assess the costs versus the benefits of action to combat climate change. Among the most influential, and the most hotly contested, is the Stern review on the economics of climate change, a dense 692-page argument, published last year, the most famous finding of which is that \"the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting\". Nicholas Stern's argument was challenged almost immediately in Cool It by the Danish statistician Bjørn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press). Lomborg does not doubt that global warming is occurring, nor that it is caused by humans, but almost alone among commentators he finds reason to welcome it. In Europe, he explains, only 200,000 people die from excess heat each year, while 1.5 million die from cold. His message is simple: more warming, less death. Lomborg's style is marked by glib, misleading associations. Even if the sea rises, Lomborg says, we shouldn't worry - we'll just put up dykes. With dykes, he asserts, some nations might end up with more land than they have today. And so the arguments go on, from rising seas to extreme weather events to malaria and other tropical diseases, the collapse of the Gulf Stream, food shortages and water shortages. In one case after another, Lomborg asserts that it's cheaper and better to do nothing immediate to combat climate change, but to invest in adapting to its consequences. It is in great contrast to Stern's painstaking and detailed analysis, and it entirely fails to dent Stern's case. In A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies (Yale), the respected economist William Nordhaus asks how to deal most cost-effectively with the climate problem. He accepts the projections of the IPCC as a correct basis on which to undertake his analysis, and sets out to examine five policy options, ranging from \"do nothing\" through to \"ambitious\" proposals such as those advocated by Gore and Stern. He concludes that the ambitious proposals are disastrously expensive, and should be avoided. But do the IPCC projections reliably reflect future changes in climate? In 2007, scientists began comparing real-world trends with the panel's projections. They found that for the key performance indicators - the rate of warming, the rise in sea level and CO2 accumulation - real-world changes were at the upper bound or beyond the worst-case scenario presented by the IPCC. Further evidence that climate change is moving faster than we thought can be found at the north pole. The sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean has glistened brightly into space for at least 3m years, and by reflecting the sun's energy it acts as a refrigerator that cools the entire planet. But where the ice melts, the dark ocean is revealed, and that captures solar energy and turns it into heat. In the summer of 2005, the rate of ice loss accelerated dramatically and has remained high ever since, the summer of 2007 seeing the greatest loss of Arctic ice ever. The scientific community is split on how the melting will turn out this year. A recent survey of Arctic specialists indicated that the majority consider a loss as great as that of 2007 to be unlikely, yet by June 2008 signs of a great melt were emerging and a senior adviser to the Norwegian government was warning that this may be the Arctic's first ice-free year. As I write, the rate of loss, while still well above average, has slowed somewhat. Yet even now it's impossible to predict. We can only project that if this summer's melt trajectory follows recent decades, by September this year the Arctic ice cap will have lost around half of its remaining ice, and be just 2.2m square kilometres. Most of those interested in climate science nowadays access information online, and one of the most significant of such contributions was recently posted by James Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute, and his colleagues, who have provided a partial explanation for these changes. They revisited a key piece of science underpinning the IPCC's work - the findings about how much warming a given amount of atmospheric CO2 pollution would produce - and discovered that, when viewed over the longer term, Earth's climate system is about twice as sensitive to CO2 pollution as is illustrated in the panel's century-long projections. One conclusion they drew is that there is already enough greenhouse gas pollution in the atmosphere to cause 2°C of warming - bringing about conditions not seen on Earth for 2m to 3m years, and constituting, according to the authors, \"a degree of warming that would surely yield 'dangerous' climate impacts\". Hansen and his colleagues pointed to a new understanding of how long it takes for the full warming consequences of a given amount of greenhouse gas to be felt. They concluded that we could expect to feel a third of any warming in the first few years. As Hansen and his colleagues put it: \"Sea-level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record, in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human-made forcing. This indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed, and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed.\" They also make a useful discrimination between climatic \"tipping points\" and \"the point of no return\". A tipping point is that at which the greenhouse gas concentration reaches a level sufficient to cause catastrophic climate change, while a point of no return is reached when that concentration of greenhouse gas has been in place sufficiently long to begin an irreversible process. Humanity is currently suspended between a tipping point and a point of no return, and the point of no return is likely to be reached within two decades. In summarising their findings, the researchers state that \"if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm\". This, they believe, can only be achieved by phasing out all conventional coal burning by 2030, and by aggressively reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by capturing it in growing tropical forests and in agricultural soils. That a rapid phase-out of coal is simply not enough is elegantly illustrated by the fact that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would remain above 350ppm for 200 years were a coal phase-out achieved within the next decade or two, and nothing else done. In his analysis, Nordhaus does identify one economically effective strategy worth pursuing. Called the \"low-cost backstop\", it revolves around identifying and developing some as yet unknown technology to combat the problem. Possible candidates include \"low-cost solar power, geothermal energy, some non-intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon-eating trees\". Writing in the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson has explored the unappealing option of such trees. The graph that first alerted humanity to the climate problem - drawn up by Charles David Keeling to show the CO2 increase from 1956 to the present - might, Dyson argues, hold the key to the solution. The graph has a generally rising line, with jags, like saw teeth, along it, which indicate a spike in CO2 each autumn in the northern hemisphere and a dip each spring. The difference between the minimum and maximum each year is around six parts per million, and it is due to the growth, then leaf fall, of the forests that grow across North America, Europe and Asia. It turns out, Dyson says, \"that about 8% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year\". If only a way could be found, he muses, to permanently sequester that carbon, we would go a long way towards solving the climate crisis - hence the genetically modified trees. But the truth is that all trees are carbon eaters. They grow from the air by drawing CO2 into their leaves, and there solidifying it to build their wood, bark and leaf tissues. Trees are congealed CO2. What we need is a way of transforming the carbon they capture into an inert state. It turns out that humanity has had the capacity to do this for thousands of years, and is now on the brink of doing it on a very large scale. The process of charcoal-making is called pyrolysis, and involves the heating of any biological matter in the absence of oxygen. The result is the generation of a synthetic gas, or a crude-oil like material, and charcoal. If the gas or oily matter is captured, it can be used to generate electricity or power transport. The charcoal is largely carbon (representing one-third to half of the carbon in the biomass) and it is inert. Indeed, the tenacity with which charcoal resists rotting, even when buried in the soil, is clear from C14-dating, which uses ancient charcoal from hearths or fires as much as 60,000 years old. Modern pyrolysis involves machinery that captures flue gas or oil, and needs no external inputs to run the machine (some of the gas being used to heat the biomass). It's already being used on a small scale on farms, for urban garbage disposal (where 1,000-tonne units are deployed) and in forestry. On farms it has multiple benefits, for the charcoal can be ploughed back into the soil, where it balances acid soils, aids soil moisture retention, adds nutrients and acts as a habitat for soil fungi and bacteria. A farmer pyrolysing crop waste gains four benefits: 1) as usual, he gets to sell the commercial part of his crop; 2) he gets to generate electricity or transport fuel; 3) where carbon is traded, he can potentially sell the carbon he sequesters; and 4) by adding charcoal to his soil, he will increase the chances of getting a better crop the following year. With so many benefits, why is pyrolysis not more widely used? Because pyrolysis machines are expensive, and farms are mostly still family businesses. If farmers are ever to be able to afford the machines, they'll need to be paid around $37 per tonne for the carbon they create. They'll also need to be living in areas with carbon trading schemes that allow charcoal as a recognised method of carbon sequestration. While the developed world could go it alone with pyrolysis, unless China and India can be induced to take a lower carbon path than the west, there is absolutely no hope for us. While both maintain formidably tough international negotiating positions, there are signs of change, particularly in the energy sectors of both countries. China has a target for renewable energy of 10% by 2020, and is embarking on the largest nuclear power programme currently being developed, while India is pursuing wind and hydro power. Were the leaders of either country seeking a guide to determining a negotiating position in Copenhagen, they could do no better than Oliver Tickell's just-published book Kyoto2 (Zed Books), which provides a big-picture approach to the prevention of climatic catastrophe. In essence, Tickell provides a blueprint for a global climate treaty. He documents the failings of the Kyoto protocol, then goes on to summarise the latest climate science, including the work of Hansen and his colleagues. The replacement to the Kyoto protocol, Tickell writes, must work effectively to achieve a level of atmospheric CO2 below 350ppm. At the heart of the proposal is a global trade in carbon with a series of reducing caps sufficiently rigorous to bring about such an outcome. One of Tickell's most telling criticisms of Kyoto is its neglect of tropical forests as a means of sequestering carbon. The destruction of rainforests causes around 18% of the carbon going into the atmosphere annually, yet only a single project concerning tropical forests has been approved under Kyoto's clean development mechanisms. These allow for polluters to gain credits by investing in a variety of ways that reduce greenhouse gases. Dyson's analysis of the Keeling curve demonstrates just how powerful forests can be as sequesterers of carbon. It's widely acknowledged that Kyoto's successor must develop mechanisms that encourage the protection and regrowing of tropical forests. Tickell's discussion of market mechanisms is densely technical, yet much of it reads as common sense. His emphasis on the urgent need for government regulation is also cogent and refreshing, for he recognises that carbon trading is necessary, but not sufficient to solve the problem. He calls clearly for governments to regulate so as to increase efficiency of energy use, to protect forests and to mandate approaches such as clean coal technologies, as well as discussing the need to limit population. Reading Kyoto2 gives one hope that there is a way forward. But will such recommendations ever be agreed to, and can they be carried out in time? The books to read George Monbiot George Marshall, author of Carbon Detox (Gaia Books), understands the psychology of climate change and our inability to get to grips with it better than anyone else I have read. Mark Lynas's Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet (Fourth Estate) is a lucid and deeply researched account of the predicted impacts of climate change, one degree at a time. In Kyoto2: How to Manage the Global Greenhouse (Zed Books) Oliver Tickell presents a global programme for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that is both radical and realistic. Caroline Lucas Seeing Green by Jonathon Porritt (currently out of print) changed my life. After reading it, I marched straight to the office of my local Green party to sign up. George Marshall's Carbon Detox is an upbeat and inspiring guide to lowering your carbon footprint. The Flood (Saqi Books), Maggie Gee's dystopian vision of a flooded future, with its well-drawn characters and lively prose, shows how the poor will always be the first to suffer the effects of climate change. Mark Lynas In Kyoto2, Oliver Tickell makes a radical suggestion: that instead of trying to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, we should instead go \"upstream\" and regulate the production of carbon-based fossil fuels. Think of a garden sprinkler: if you want to stop the lawn getting wet, you don't try to catch each drop as it falls - you turn off the tap. The World Without Us (Virgin Books) by Alan Weisman contains a disarmingly simple but wonderfully clever idea: what would the planet look like if we all disappeared overnight? The perfect springboard for a much more engaging and fascinating discussion of humanity's environmental impact. Fred Pearce Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (Penguin Modern Classics), published in 1962, was environmentalism's tipping point. Before Silent Spring, we worried about saving wildlife; afterwards we feared our own species would drown in a toxic tide of chemicals. In 1979 came Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP) by James Lovelock. Not since Charles Darwin's Origin of Species has any book so shaken science's sense of how our world works. John Reader's Man on Earth (published in 1988 and currently out of print) is an overlooked masterpiece about the ecology of human cultures. Leo Hickman Robert Henson's Rough Guide to Climate Change (Rough Guides) is the best pocketbook primer on the subject. On its publication in late 2006, it was sent to every MP with a short questionnaire, including the question \"How important a concern is climate change?\" Hundreds answered, the majority of whom said it was the most pressing issue of our age. Gordon Brown never responded. Hide Tide by Mark Lynas (Picador) is a journey through the climate change \"hot spots\" of the world. It's the testimonies of the people Lynas meets who are already suffering from the onset of climate change that produce the most persuasive argument for us to urgently face up to the challenge ahead. Laurie David Earth in the Balance (Longman), written by Al Gore 15 years ago, is doubly fascinating to read now. It makes you realise how much he was right. I devoted myself to the issue of climate change after reading Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point (Basic Books). If you look at Keith Bradsher's High &amp; Mighty (PublicAffairs US), you will never walk past an SUV again without shaking your head. What Al Gore is to awareness of global warming, William McDonough is to the solution. His Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things (Rodale Press) is the only book about the environment that is actually waterproof.

After a long day's hike, I'm taking in the view from the summit of Jebel Abbas Pasha, among the ruins of a palace commissioned by a viceroy of Egypt called Abbas Hilmi Pasha. Abbas, the story goes, suffered from tuberculosis and wanted a desert equivalent of a Swiss sanatorium. But he was not popular with his servants: he once had a red-hot horseshoe nailed to the foot of a groom who was slacking on the job. So the underling did him in before the consumption could, and only the first-storey walls of the palace were built. Dressed blocks of stone lie abandoned at the entrance, as though a grateful workforce simply walked off the job when the news broke. If Ozymandias had a home, this would be it. Poor old Abbas is largely forgotten these days. Most tourists who venture inland from Egypt's Red Sea coast visit just two places, and I could see one of them from my perch on Jebel Abbas Pasha: the summit of Jebel Musa or Mount Sinai, where Moses received the 10 commandments. Watching the sun rise from the top of Mount Sinai is wildly popular, with up to a thousand people sleeping out each night. (What happens about toilet facilities doesn't bear thinking about.) At its foot is St Catherine's, the world's oldest continuously inhabited monastery and the second of the area's honeypots, where hundreds of tourists jostle to see the original burning bush. But there is another Sinai, far from resorts like Sharm el-Sheikh or the coach-party hotspots. It's a world of silent canyons, or wadis, and rugged peaks studded with livid patches of green where the desert has been coaxed into life by the local Bedouin tribe, the Jebeliya, or 'mountain people'. Welcome to trekking heaven. The Jebeliya are, the story goes, the descendants of 200 Roman soldiers drafted by the emperor Justinian from Egypt and the Black Sea region to protect St Catherine's, his new monastery, founded in 527. Over the past 14 centuries they intermarried with other Bedouin and converted to Islam, but they are proud of their special status and the way they have survived in these arid mountains. The Bedouin legacy in this beautiful but harsh environment is best understood in the gardens they have cultivated for hundreds of years. The Christian monks they served showed the Jebeliya how to grow food in a dry climate, and they relied for generations on the fruit and grains that their tiny walled enclosures, called karm, could produce. The past few decades have proved difficult for traditional Bedouin culture, however. The construction of resort towns such as Sharm and the influx of Nile Egyptians have left many Bedouin feeling like strangers in their own land. Old fishing rights have been revoked and land sold for knockdown prices. For their part, Egyptians view the once-nomadic Bedouin's cross-border ties with Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia with suspicion. The chance to earn money on the coast has tempted many young Bedouin away from their former lives. Flocks of goats have dwindled and some karm have fallen derelict. But the Bedouin are proud and still deeply in love with their landscape. They know their identity is intimately connected to the desert and mountains. Standing beside me on the summit of Jebel Abbas Basha is my guide, Rajab, who has been waiting patiently to start the long descent to that night's campsite in Wadi Zawatiin. Rajab, 32, has two small children and relies heavily on guiding tourists for his living. The going rate is £5 a day. Born in a remote wadi in the mountains, he lives now with his family in the local town of St Catherine. 'You know,' he says as we walk down the dusty zig-zag track Abbas Pasha's workmen carved out of the mountain, 'if there are no tourists for a few weeks, I go to the mountains anyway.' He is certainly fit. The walking around here can get pretty tough, and more than once I found myself scrambling across rocks and pulling myself up with my hands to keep up with him. The landscape is shaped as much by wind as by water, with bizarre shapes sculpted from huge boulders. Some of these strange cavities have been turned into grain stores and dwellings by the Jebeliya and by the Orthodox monks who used to find retreat in Sinai's remoter corners. In the evenings we set up camp in a garden and sleep under the stars around the embers of a fire, after a huge meal. We're more than 2,000m above sea level, and in winter it gets cold, so you need a good sleeping bag. But the beauty of Sinai's mountains is that you can trek here pretty much all year round. Come in spring for the almond blossom, or in the autumn to try the fruit. The highlight of my four days' walking was a swim in the magical pool of Galtal-Azraq - the blue pool. From our camp at a half-ruined garden in a dusty bowl called Farsh Romana (the place of pomegranates), we walked for two hours until, below in a deep-set canyon, we glimpsed the 20ft pool of water. Diving into it, in the wilds of these dry mountains, was extraordinarily beautiful. It would be possible to show up in St Catherine and start trekking on your own, but while Sinai's mountains are compact, they are also fiendishly complex, and people regularly get lost. And anyway, while the landscape is ruggedly beautiful, the most appealing thing about walking here is learning how the Bedouin have survived and prospered. And for that you'll need a guide. Rajab spent the days answering my rush of dumb questions with aristocratic politesse. Every so often he would amble over with a sprig of something in his hand and crush it under my nose, releasing the scent of yet another herb. Thyme, oregano, mint and sage all grow wild here, and brushing against the plants releases the most fabulous smells. It only adds to the harmony of the place. Herbal medicinal lore is a major feature of Bedouin culture. They use the scores of plants available to them as analgesics, astringents, diuretics, emetics, purgatives, poultices, salves and tonics. They even do something really rather disgusting with donkey poo to cure a bad cough. But herbal medicines are also used for more metaphysical ailments, such as bad spirits and the negative effects of sorcery and witchcraft. This heady combination of natural beauty, human resourcefulness and the romance of desert life makes this corner of Egypt very special indeed. It's not much further to fly than Morocco, with a three-hour transfer from Sharm to St Catherine. There aren't many places where you can be exploring such wild mountains in the morning and diving on coral reefs in the afternoon. So it's a bit perplexing that on my entire trek, I didn't meet another tourist. A lot of work has been done over the past 10 years, funded largely by the EU, to build just the sort of infrastructure that is in harmony with the low-impact lives of the Bedouin. In 1996, some 5,750 sq km of southern Sinai was designated the St Catherine's Protectorate to preserve the region's heritage. Trouble is, no one thought to explain all that to the sort of tourists who appreciate the sensitive approach. On my first day in St Catherine I saw a classic example of this. The EU has funded a beautiful visitor centre, housed in a collection of Bedouin-style stone huts, that tells the story of the region's nature and culture. As a primer for trekking through these arid mountains it was invaluable. But the centre is locked up most of the time, with no one to run it. We had to find a local official at his home to open up for us. Coachloads of tourists from the coast drive into the Protectorate each day to see the monastery and have a camel ride. The fees they pay to enter the park don't stay long in Sinai, but are absorbed by central government in Cairo. Local Bedouin feel ignored by the tourist trade, which values numbers above all. A visible police presence following recent terrorist attacks on the Red Sea resorts hasn't helped. It was a similar story at the Al Karm Ecolodge. This stunning refuge three hours' hike from St Catherine is located in Wadi Gharba on the old pilgrims' road to the monastery. It was opened in 2002 with EU funding and is essentially a minimalist boutique hotel - but one with no electricity, and elegant showers heated by solar energy. Al Karm is a stunning place to stay. The accommodation is spread through a cluster of Jebeliya-style houses. Egyptians come down from Cairo to escape the crowds and spend a few days reading or doing yoga. There's a Nabataean village to explore, built by the ancient traders who created Petra, and some excellent local hikes. Even in summer, the heat isn't intolerable, thanks to its altitude of 1,100m. In winter, guests huddle around the sitting-room fire. Jamil Atiya is treasured by his regular customers as a capable cook and an amiable host, representing all that is good about Bedouin hospitality. The inexplicable thing is that even in a good month it is barely occupied at all, despite a night's full board costing only £10. If you had a book to write, and a solar panel to charge your laptop, it would be perfect. I drove out to Al Karm along a bumpy jeep track with a man who could help fire up the lacklustre attention Sinai's remoter corners have received. Mark Knutton fell in love with the region and its people during a short trek and decided to turn his passion into a business. He had a background in telecommunications marketing, so it was quite a career shift, but Knutton thinks he can help provide fresh impetus to sustainable tourism initiatives already in place - like the Al Karm Ecolodge. Bedouin Paths, his new trekking company, which runs its first treks next month, is, he says, all about making ethical tourism pay. A large percentage of his profits will go to social programmes in Bedouin communities. Knutton plans to pay for projects requested by local people, the first of which will be a school. Right now, the classroom is a disused lock-up with a blackboard, but Knutton says the money trekkers pay will allow him to hire good teachers from Cairo. In the long term, he's planning a new classroom and, more ambitiously, simple lodges near the gardens of the Bedouin to provide shelter for trekkers and an income for the community. Just as importantly, it will give the Bedouin a commercial incentive to restore those gardens that have fallen into disrepair. Working with Cairo-based architect Anne-Catherine Escher, Knutton is drawing up plans for inexpensive units for washing, cooking and sleeping that can be added as money allows but are in tune with the existing buildings. I couldn't help feeling, sitting in the garden of an old man called Ouda, in the improbably named Wadi Shagg, that the acid test for the survival of the Jebeliya will be the fate of these beautiful gardens. I was surrounded by trees and shrubs, offering figs, pomegranates, mulberries, walnuts, almonds, apples, pears, oranges, grapes and olives. Despite three years of minimal rainfall, Ouda had maintained the miracle of this green oasis. But will this garden still be here in 20 or even 10 years? For once, tourism could be part of a solution rather than the problem, and Knutton's timing is flawless. After a brief absence when projects have been allowed to drift, the EU is now investing again in St Catherine's sustainable tourism. Unrolling my mattress in Ouda's garden and lying down to sleep next to a pomegranate bush, I flicked on my iPod. By chance, it picked out a track by New York DJ Raz Mesinai, 'The Bedouin Walks Alone'. Hang on, I thought - not today he didn't. Essentials Ed Douglas travelled with Bedouin Paths (020 8744 0474; www.bedouinpaths.com) whose treks start in October. A week's trek costs £350, including transfers, baggage camels, meals, guides and accommodation, but not flights. Of this price, 40 per cent is earmarked for teaching and for rebuilding Bedouin buildings and gardens.

Over the past two weeks he has inferred that we believe that \"man-made global warming is either a myth or not worth tackling\" (The denial industry, September 19; Pundits who contest climate change should tell us who is paying them, September 26) On the contrary, we know that carbon emissions is one of the factors that contribute to climate change - we don't debate or dispute this. We agree with scientific assessments which conclude that climate change poses risks that may prove to be significant for society and ecosystems. Consequently, we are taking steps to reduce and minimise carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations. In addition we support approaches to reduce emissions more broadly in ways that are cost effective for society and that consider the uncertainties that remain. Does this sound like a company in denial? We think not. As for the comment that \"ExxonMobil gives money to scores of organisations that claim the science on global warming is inconclusive\": to be clear, we give financial support to organisations which research significant policy issues and promote informed discussion on issues of direct relevance to the company. These include topics such as international affairs, environmental issues and market economics. These organisations are supported by many other interested parties. They do not speak on our behalf, nor do we control their views and messages. Our financial support for such organisations is publicly posted on our website. So what needs to be done? Over the coming century we believe that risks associated with growing global greenhouse gas emissions will best be addressed by the development and global deployment of innovative technologies with far lower greenhouse gas emissions. To promote that objective we are a founding sponsor - along with Toyota, General Electric and Schlumberger - of the $225m Global Climate Energy Project at Stanford University that is focused on pursuing technology breakthroughs to deliver energy with much lower carbon dioxide emissions. It is the largest privately funded, long-term research program of its type in the world.The project's current focus is: hydrogen production, storage and use; wind, biomass and solar energy; carbon dioxide capture and storage; and advanced transportation and coal technologies. We are also jointly researching advanced vehicle technologies, to improve low-emission gasoline and diesel fuel engine systems. Furthermore, we have reduced emissions in our own operations, such as the flaring of natural gas at production sites, and invested to make efficiency savings at our refineries (at a cost of $1bn in 2004-5). In 2004, these and other actions enabled our company to avoid 10m metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions - the equivalent of taking more than 1.5m cars off the road.

British temperatures will rise for the next 30 years even if future greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, Sir David King will say in a speech tomorrow. As the damage wrought by existing pollution feeds slowly through the world's ecosystems, it is essential that the public adapts to change, he will argue. His call comes as the Blairite think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, publishes a report today calling for Britain to become a 'zero waste' country, where rubbish is recycled or reused instead of dumped in landfill sites. It says taxes should be applied to disposable products such as razors and cameras, encouraging people to buy more lasting products. The study argues consumers should learn to repair and reuse items rather than throwing them out, as well as recycling more. The think-tank report wants manufacturers to be compelled to design durable products that can be reused rather than throwaway plastic that will need regular, and profitable, replacement. More controversially, it recommends that councils should charge householders for taking away non-recyclable rubbish: Britons throw away more than 300 million tonnes of rubbish every year and recycle less than half of it. 'We have become an increasingly throwaway society, reliant on cheap, disposable and hard to recycle goods,' said Nick Pearce, the think-tank's director. 'Business needs to take greater responsibility for the whole life of a product.' Denmark, Sweden and Belgium all impose taxes on non-recyclable products, the report reveals. King told The Observer that Britain should prepare for major changes to help it withstand hotter summers and wetter winters. These should include setting aside land around major cities as housing-free flood plains, which could regularly be flooded during flash downpours that will become more common. The greatest flood risk will be inland rather than along the coast. King is also overseeing a project to design smarter buildings capable of withstanding a 'rather hot 21st century'. The building of the future would need to be wireless rather than cluttered with the electrical paraphernalia of a typical office or home, drawing 'whatever energy it can from its own environment' via geothermal, wind or solar energy. Such buildings would be lit by natural daylight harnessed through 'light pipes' - channels up to the roof designed to let light flood through rooms. The buildings would have their own waste recycling on site, in a drastic change from what he called the 'Victorian environment' in which most Britons still live. 'Adaptation is as important as mitigation,' he added. 'I think it's arguable that the crisis in Darfur is a political crisis driven by the impacts of climate change: it's now demonstrable that the 32,000 fatalities in central Europe in 2003 [during the summer heatwave] are a climate change-driven natural disaster. 'We have little chance of avoiding dangerous climate change: it will take something like 30 years for the Earth's climate system to catch up with what we have done to it. The next 30 years of change is in the pipeline and we are going to have to adapt and prepare.' Other technological advances, he said, included 'smart' transport systems allowing travellers to use their mobile phone to get instant information on how long a journey by public transport to any destination would take. King added that he increasingly hoped that a new global deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, succeeding the Kyoto treaty, could be reached within two years. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, which with America refused to ratify the Kyoto deal, recently signalled a willingness to discuss a new treaty. That, King said, was an optimistic sign: 'I think John Howard's position is unlikely to have moved without discussions with the White House.' 4 billion Number of throwaway cartons we get through in a year. They are typically made of several materials which are difficult to recycle. 7 million Number of tonnes of food dumped into landfill every year, even though it is easy to recycle at home, by making compost. £424 The amount of money each Briton wastes on average per year on food that is bought but never eaten."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/dec/03/bali","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-03T00:00:13Z","webTitle":"What single breakthrough would best advance the fight against climate change?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/03/bali","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/03/bali","fields":{"headline":"What single breakthrough would best advance the fight against climate change?","bodyText":"Kofi Annan The battle to find the funds Climate change is an all encompassing threat - threat to health, security, food production and to our ecosystems. Leaders must take decisive action in Bali to come to grips with climate change. The scientific evidence is compelling and alarming. We must sustain a two-pronged approach: mitigation and adaptation. The only suitable response is a binding international framework agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions beyond the Kyoto protocol which expires in 2012. We have to take steps to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities to the impact of climate change. In order to achieve the global development agenda, we must integrate environmental policies with social and economic policies. It will take huge resources to fund the adaptation to the actual impact of climate change on communities around the world. Funding must be a part of any serious solution to the climate change predicament we face. Kofi Annan was the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations David Bellamy Conservation, not carbon doom Consensus at Bali (despite the air miles) should replace the unproven big stick of carbon doom and gloom with an interactive map highlighting the fact that both rich and poor will prosper from good science, engineering and technologies already in the pipeline. No need for debilitating taxes, as environmental rewards will flow from the efficient use of energy, water and other resources. Directing funding to conserve the worlds natural areas, their soils and biodiversity is the bedrock of this bottom line.

In 50 years, we went from the Wright Brothers to the jet engine and trans-Atlantic travel. And today we are global mass transit for 2.2 billion people. What's possible in the next 50 years? The breakthrough I want to see is a plane that does not pollute - reducing aviation's 2% share of carbon emissions to zero. Some building blocks already exist - fuel cell technology, solar power and fuel from algae. Airlines, manufacturers and fuel suppliers are aligned and hard at work. What's missing is government commitment to coordinate and fund breakthrough research. Anything is possible. That's the spirit of our history - and it will define our future. Giovanni Bisignani is director general of the International Air Transport Association Richard Branson Halt rainforest destruction The climate is already changing and we need to find urgent ways to mitigate that change immediately and maintain as much biodiversity on the planet as possible. The most positive but realistic thing that governments could agree in Bali is to halt the cutting down of virgin tropical rainforests with immediate effect and agree a method by which the major economies, big multinationals and other carbon offset groups could pay for it. Why is this so important? The next five years of carbon emissions from burning rainforests will alone be greater than all the emissions from air travel since the Wright brothers first flight in 1903 until at least 2025. Richard Branson is the chairman of Virgin Group Brian Eno Electoral reform comes first It seems like an unambitious idea, but I think the most important thing we could do to deal with climate change is to change our voting systems. Right now, many people who care about climate change don't dare to vote for the parties who have shown a willingness to deal with it: in particular the Greens and the Liberal Democrats. Why? Because our \"first past the post system\" makes a vote for a minority party seem like a waste. This seems to me a way out of the electoral trap that we're in now, where many people vote negatively - to exclude - rather than positively - to include. Brian Eno is a musician and campaigner Leon Fuerth A way to trap carbon dioxide The single breakthrough that would be a game-changer is technological: it would involve an efficient method for trapping carbon dioxide as it is generated, before it can enter the atmosphere. The hurdles are difficult to clear, however: it would have to be a stable method; its costs would have to make it affordable not just in countries like the US, but in rapidly developing countries like China and India. Even such a breakthrough would have to be coupled with a profound change of mind about relying on massive consumption of carbon based fuels. It would have to be used as a way out of our dependence on these fuels, not as a free pass to go on as before. In every instance, a profound change of public and official attitude is needed, and Bali can help that along. Leon Fuerth is former national security adviser to Vice President Al Gore Paul Golby Developed nations' duty A global problem demands a global solution. All the developed nations must signal their commitment to new long term reduction targets and underpin the emergence of a global carbon market. This, together with a commitment to urgently develop and demonstrate all forms of low carbon energy technology, from efficient micro-generation in homes to industrial scale projects to capture carbon from the world's fossil power plants, will give nations, businesses and communities the incentive and confidence to invest in radical measures. Dr Paul Golby is chief executive of E.ON UK Zac Goldsmith Make leaders feel the pressure We can try to persuade everyone - through books and extravagant concerts - to change their ways. But if we're honest, how many of the planets' 6 billion people will actively respond? Call me a pessimist but I'm not holding my breath, not least because a vast number of people cannot afford to make meaningful green choices. Today if you want to travel by train, eat organic food or drive a clean car, you need to pay more. The alternative is to demand proper leadership from government so that green choices become available to everyone. It has the tools. The single most important thing we can all do is to pile the pressure on our leaders. We must let them know we expect them to do the right thing, and that they will be rewarded for doing the right thing. Zac Goldsmith is a Conservative candidate and environmental adviser to the party Mayer Hillman Allocate carbon equitably The equitable allocation of carbon emissions across the world's population and its application through mandatory tradable personal carbon rationing is the only realistic way forward. Support is gathering pace - German chancellor Merkel backed it this summer. Technology, increased energy efficiency and green taxation cannot conceivably ride to the rescue within the timescale remaining for sufficiently effective action. Dr Mayer Hillman is senior fellow emeritus at the Policy Studies Institute and author of How We Can Save the Planet Isabel Hilton Policy has to follow science The single most important breakthrough - which must form the basis of action - would be acknowledgment that policy must follow science, however difficult that is. We need an agreement at Bali of an upper stabilisation limit that recognises that we cannot allow the global average temperature to rise above two degrees centigrade. In order to avoid a greater rise and the consequent risk of runaway effects, we must agree that concentrations of greenhouse gases should not be allowed to rise above 400 to 450 part per million, CO2 equivalent. Until now, few national leaders have had the courage to make this commitment. Without it, we are plagued by shifting targets and lack of clarity. With a clearly defined target, policy can be designed to meet it. Isabel Hilton is editor of Chinadialogue and OpenDemocracy Jeremy Leggett The renewable remedy I can only agree with the original UK government energy review of 2003, which concluded that \"solar energy could meet world energy demand using less than 1% of land now under crops and pasture.\" We wouldn't need the arable land, actually. We could use the tops and sides of buildings. Hand-in-hand with energy conservation and efficiency, I have no doubt that solar can lead the renewables family in powering our world cleanly a few decades from now. But we will need to overcome the vested interests - or enlighten them - if we are to get to the promised land. Jeremy Leggett is chairman of Solar-century and author of The Carbon War Mark Lynas A global target for a 80% cut I know this is probably too much to ask, but it would be great if world leaders could get together and actually hammer out an agreement to stabilise the world's climate. Bali and Kyoto are important, but are at best incremental steps towards a long-term goal that no-one seems to want to talk about. A real breakthrough would be to agree on a worldwide target for emissions cuts of 80% by 2050 in order to keep global warming from passing the magic two degrees mark. That's it really. We can work out the nitty gritty of who does what later. Mark Lynas is the author of Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet Frank Loy The great American potential The answer is straightforward and, for an American, a bit embarassing. It would be for the US to adopt, at last, a national programme to reduce GHG emissions: a meaningful emissions cap covering all or most of the economy, with short and mid-term targets, a trading system to reduce costs of compliance, and complementary policies to promote low emission technologies where price signals don't work. US domestic action is a precondition for a meaningful agreement involving all key nations. If the US continues to dither and not adopt a domestic law, not only will China, India (and maybe even Japan) reject possibly costly actions, but the US Senate will resist approving an international climate treaty. Frank Loy was US under secretary of state for global affairs and chief climate negotiator from 1998 to 2001 Wangari Maathai Develop and protect If there were a technological breakthrough that offered an affordable and accessible way to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels we would most certainly see a major change in the rate of global warming. In connection with this, if a decision was made to protect the major forests of the world, and in particular the Congo, the Amazon, and the forests of Southeast Asia, that, in addition to the breakthrough in technology, would make all the difference for our planet. Dr Wangari Maathai is a Kenyan environmental activist and Nobel Peace laureate George Marshall From knowing to believing For 20 years the assumption has always been that if only people knew how serious climate change is surely they will act. But knowing something and believing in it are not the same. Climate change is so huge, so destabilising, so far outside our usual experience that our natural response it to push it away. People are still clutching on to any argument that suggests that it is still unproven, in the future, someone else's problem or someone else fault. Once you have accepted and internalised climate change you are not taking action to \"save the planet\" - you are doing it as a statement of who you are and what you believe. And that is how to really change things. George Marshall is the author of Carbon Detox and blogs at Climatedenial.org George Monbiot Fairness and simplicity on CO2 There should be an equal allocation, worldwide, of the right to produce carbon dioxide. Our rations can be tradeable - people may use more than their share if they are prepared to buy it - but the revenue should be returned to those who use less. This system works because it is just, easy to understand, requires very little policing and creates powerful incentives to use low carbon technologies. George Monbiot is the author of Heat: How We Can Stop the Planet Burning Rajendra K Pachauri Radical change to transport Each individual has to be part of the global solution, so that collectively the human race can meet this challenge effectively. In my view the most feasible option would be to bring about radical changes in our transportation habits. What every individual can do is to ensure that places that one can easily walk to are covered on foot. Each individual must set as a goal actions to promote low carbon-dioxide emissions from transportation that he or she is responsible for. Dr RK Pachauri is chairman of the Nobel peace prize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Jonathon Porritt Real steps on the carbon price The Bali Consensus is that we must reduce emissions of CO2 by at least 80% by 2050. As Sir Nicholas Stern made so clear, that will only happen if the price of a tonne of CO2 gets as high as possible as fast as possible - globally. Governments know this. They also know that trading schemes (like the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme) will take far too long to get us to that point. So, in an ideal world, they need to do three things: determine what price level is required to achieve the 80% cut by 2050; set a \"floor price\" for CO2 to kick in no later than 2012; agree the \"price milestones\" between 2012 and 2050. Almost everything else will follow. Jonathon Porritt is chairman of the UK sustainable development commission and founder director of Forum for the Future Jeremy Rifkin A third industrial revolution The pivotal economic changes in world history occur when new energy regimes converge with new communication regimes. Today, the technology that made possible the IT and internet revolutions is coming together with renewable energy and hydrogen and fuel cell storage technology to create the foundation for a third industrial revolution and a post-carbon, post-nuclear era. In 25 years, businesses and homeowners will produce much of their own power with locally available renewable energy, and store it in the form of hydrogen. Surplus energy will be shared with others via an intelligent \"intergrid\" just as we now produce our own information and share it with others via the internet. This revolution will help usher in a near zero-emission energy era. Jeremy Rifkin is an adviser on climate changet to the EU commission Joseph Romm A moratorium on old coal The science is in and we've run out of time for further delay. It's time for a bold step to reverse emissions trends immediately - a global moratorium on the construction of coal plants that don't capture and sequester their carbon. As part of the moratorium, we need: an aggressive energy-efficiency strategy to replace the need for most new power plants; direct assistance to countries like China and India to build alternative zero-carbon plants; extensive testing of carbon-capture technology; and a global effort to identify and certify permanent geologic repositories for carbon. Joseph Romm is senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress and editor of ClimateProgress.org Nicholas Stern The rich must take the lead We need a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the rich countries leading the way on targets and trading. The overall targets of 50% reductions in global emissions by 2050 (relative to 1990) agreed at the G8 summit in Heiligendamm in June are essential if we are to have a reasonable chance of keeping temperature increases below 2 or 3°C. Within these global targets, the rich countries should aim for a more ambitious reductions target of at least 80% - either made directly or purchased via a global mechanism for trading emissions. Trade in emissions has the double benefit of keeping costs down and providing glue for the global deal.

'Sometimes people come here just to watch the sun set over the cliffs,' says the park's director, Luis Ferreira. This aspect of Portugal seems a million miles away from the golf courses, piri-piri chicken and water parks that many holidaymakers will associate with the country. Yet a few developers are now leading the country into an eco-holiday property revolution designed to both protect and make the most of Portugal's natural beauty. The beaches around Costa Vicentina are remote and tranquil. 'Surfers, windsurfers, birdwatchers, hikers and nature-lovers are being drawn to the wild beauty of the national park,' says Artur Simes, managing director of Atlantic Estates. 'On the west coast there are no marinas, few golf courses, few luxury resorts and hotels - but you can find nature as it comes.' After nearly 20 years of mainstream and not very environmentally friendly coastal developments, the Portuguese are now fervently protecting their coastline. Building legislation has toughened, especially in the national park. 'We do not allow any more building within the park itself,' says Ferreira. But on the outskirts of the park, a limited number of developments are being permitted. One is Alma Verde (literally 'Green Soul'), an environmentally friendly 'well-being' residential village with its own spa, built by a British developer. Built on the gently sloping hillside of an old Portuguese farm and surrounded by fig and olive groves, Alma Verde is enveloped in an air of quiet stillness. Its cool white-washed villas and landscaped gardens overlook the unspoilt scenery of the Costa Vicentina - a far cry from the stifling congestion around Faro. Each villa is built from sustainable materials, including handmade sun-baked clay bricks and reclaimed tropical hardwood. Alma Verde's British architect Jes Mainwaring has also designed an innovative natural cooling and heating system to avoid the use of electricity-guzzling air-conditioning units. The aim, says Mainwaring, is for each villa to be as low-energy as possible. 'Our ethos is to take a responsible approach to development, at an affordable cost. We're doing this to show it can be done. If we can encourage other developers to take a similar attitude towards the environment, we can achieve something,' explains John Tranmer, managing director of Alma Verde. The homes, on sale through Atlantic Estates, start at £314,000 for a three-bedroom villa. Further north near Lisbon, a pioneering eco-property revolution is taking place. Mata de Sesimbra is the world's first-ever integrated sustainable living programme for eco-tourism launched by One Planet Living, a joint initiative between WWF and UK development group Bioregional. The project includes 8,000 zero-carbon holiday eco-homes and a major nature restoration scheme. The use of sustainable materials will reduce domestic carbon emissions by at least 30 per cent, while low-flow taps will cut water consumption by half. The development will be powered by solar energy and cars are banned from the centre of the resort. Instead, residents will be provided with free bikes. A one-bedroom apartment in Mata de Sesimbra costs about £60,000 while a large five-bedroom villa costs £600,000. The first phase will be completed by 2008. The former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde is also welcoming tourism with a heavy dose of environmental caution. 'People here have learnt from the dangers of overdevelopment in, say, the Canary Islands,' explains Jim Campbell of Sambala Developments, which is creating an eco-resort on the tropical Cape Verdian island of Santiago. 'Our philosophy is not to deprive the island of its natural resources - we staunchly believe that we have a responsibility to practise in a low impact way.' Sambala's commitment to the environment extends beyond its construction and includes the entire community. It has given land back to the locals to help develop Santiago's first social housing project and is also planting bio-fuel-producing nut crops to help the entire island become carbon neutral. The properties themselves use recycled steel frames made from old Cadillacs. They also come supplied with everything from recycled kettles and utensils to tropical hardwood furniture made from salvaged and reclaimed Indian teak by designer Arbor Vetum. Campbell says: 'We're here for the long haul, so it's important that we get this right now. By taking these measures now, we are demonstrating our long-term commitment to the island so that the local community can benefit from our being there.' Vivendas de Santiago, the second phase of Sambala Village, is selling off-plan townhouses and villas starting from £110,000.

As Tony Blair signed a letter with his Dutch counterpart warning that Europe only has 10-15 years to avoid \"catastrophic\" tipping points on climate change, solar and other renewable power groups said all the grants available for households had been used up, half-way through the current financial year. The scheme to encourage people to adopt green measures means homeowners can get a grant of up to 50%, saving thousands of pounds, on the cost of installing features such as solar panels to generate electricity. Earlier this year the Department of Trade and Industry replaced its old Clear Skies programme of grants for renewable energy with one known as the Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP) which put £80m in a pot for the next three years to boost the use of solar and wind power among others. Of this, just £6.5m was allocated to subsidise the use of renewables by households, with the rest going to promote greater use of alternative energy by public and other large buildings. Of the £6.5m, £3.5m was allocated for the 2006-07 financial year, £2m for next year and £1m the year after, with the idea that by then the renewables industry should be up and running without needing any subsidy. But because of the popularity of the grants, this year's £3.5m, supposed to last until next April, ran out this week. The Solar Trade Association, British Wind Energy Association and Renewable Energy Association have written a joint letter to the energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, warning that the viability of the fledgling industry is at risk. \"With six months of the financial year left to run, renewable energy installers and their customers now face a major black hole in government support until the start of year two of the programme in April 2007. \"This follows your department's decision to make severe cuts in grant support for household renewable energy systems earlier this year under the new LCBP. It was a decision which conflicts with the government's own microgeneration strategy and rapidly rising public interest in mass-market renewables.\" Gareth Ellis, head of renewables at the National Energy Foundation, added: \"There is much more regulation and funding encouraging the application of renewables to new buildings and homes, but it is important to remember that the big market out there is existing homes. \"If the market for renewables is not encouraged then we are not only missing a huge opportunity but also jeopardising the tremendous progress achieved by specialist renewable energy businesses in the UK to date.\" A spokesman for the DTI hinted that more money may be found to top up the empty grant pot, either in new funds or in money diverted from elsewhere in the LCBP. \"We want to develop a sustainable industry that does not rely too much on subsidies and the fact that you can now buy solar panels and micro-wind turbines in the high street shows that we are getting closer to that on the domestic front at least.\" But he said the DTI was reviewing the amount that will be available for the household stream: \"We will be meeting with industry representatives to discuss any changes, and we hope to make an announcement shortly.\" Recent calculations by the Guardian showed that with the sharp rises in electricity and gas prices over the past year, solar energy for houses now makes economic as well as environmental sense, but only when the grants are included. In the case of solar photovoltaic cells, the grant is worth 50% of the typical installation cost of £12,000. Photovoltaics have remained expensive because of a worldwide shortage of silicon, from which they are made. Household grants DTI grants in theory available for renewable energy installations: Solar thermal Solar panels generating hot water, 50%-70% of annual needs. Grant is £400, 8-10% of installation cost. Solar PV Solar panels generating electricity, up to half annual needs. Costs around £12,000, grants roughly 50%. Wind turbines Up to 30% of overall £1,500 cost. Small hydro Up to 30% of overall cost, around £4,000 per kW installed, up to 5 kW. Ground/air/water heat pumps System can cost £6,500. Grant is £1,200, up to 30% of costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/gamesblog/2006/aug/16/gottahaveagi","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-16T08:58:14Z","webTitle":"Gotta have a gimmick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/aug/16/gottahaveagi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/aug/16/gottahaveagi","fields":{"headline":"Gotta have a gimmick","bodyText":"All this talk about William Castle has caused me to pause and think about the greatest - but most useless - gimmicks ever incorporated into games. Gimmicks can work, but often they're used to hide a sub-standard movie product. There's a fine line between innovation and gimmick. Castle's seat-shocking episode during screenings of The Tingler and John Waters' Smell-o-Vision are shining examples. Still, 3D is neat. IMAX is cool. Smell-o-vision is even making steps towards a triumphant return to a screen near you... Here's our list. Please feel free to add. The Fishing Rod Controller The famous fishing rod controller for the Sega Dreamcast's Bass Fishing was utterly pointless, but a rather good idea. It used motion sensors to determine how far the player had cast off and a preposterous windy-up thing to reel the virtual supper back in. (Yawn) The best thing about it was that it cold be used across games. My favourite was Track and Field. Buzz buzzers Positioned as controllers which \"break down the gaming barriers\", the Buzz buzzers are simply giant red button interlopers on the joypad's domain. Nocturne's fabric I've got a real bee in my bonnet about this one. I remember reviewing this game many years ago and understanding quickly why all the press release could shout about was the fantastic real-time fabric effects. Bullet Time Only used in Max Payne, bullet time slowed down the action on the screen so the player could see just how cool s/he looked while blowing up a bad guy. Irritating as hell. Usually the \"off\" option was immediately deployed. Eight Players on Four Controllers Micro Machines is a great little racing game, but it's difficult enough to keep four players on the screen at any one time. If anyone slips off, everyone's gotta wait. Where's the continuity in that? So to double-up on Nintendo's joypads is ridiculous. Feels like it was designed for a photo-op to me. Dual Shock First premiered with the PlayStation console, this rumble-feature has become an industry standard. Thousands of people were forced to purchase the newfangled controller in 1999, when the game Ape Escape couldn't be played without it. Time-Reverse An excellent innovation from Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. Oops, you've just stepped off that cliff. Quick! Reverse and try try again! Helpful for those post-pub gaming. Madness 1Up reminds me of Eternal Darkness' clever manipulation of sanity. From the article: developers Silicon Knights decided to give players the opportunity to share in the hero and heroine's madness by altering the game world according to their degenerating mental health. So as the sanity meter drifted closer to the danger zone, odd things would happen -- for instance, the screen would appear to melt... or worse. Solar Sensor Hideo Kojima's studio is well-known for introducing all sorts of fascinating gameplay which heighten the immersion of an experience. They also have a penchant for the surreal. Enter the solar sensor in Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand, a game which requires that players (gasp) leave their pits and head into the sun. Solar energy supplies the game's weapon. Unfortunately, the GameBoy Advance's screen reflects it. Microphones Until Sony got the right (karaoke) application for them, console microphones were terrible. The virtual pet Seaman, the Dreamcast's most disturbing product, couldn't understand a word you were saying and would expire in protest. Even the more recent Nintendo GameCube microphone has issues with word recognition. Surely there are many others from days of yore."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2006/aug/03/spaceexploration.highereducation","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-02T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"Hawking's response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/aug/03/spaceexploration.highereducation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2006/aug/03/spaceexploration.highereducation","fields":{"headline":"Hawking's response","bodyText":"How can the human race survive the next hundred years? I don't know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face. Before the 1940s, the main threat to our survival came from collisions with asteroids. Such collisions have caused mass extinctions in the past, but the last one was 70m years ago, so the likelihood that we will need the services of Bruce Willis in the next hundred years is very small. A much more immediate danger, is nuclear war. America and Russia, each have more than enough warheads to kill everyone on Earth, several times over, and the same may now be true of China. The world came perilously close to nuclear annihilation on more than one occasion in the last 50 years. With the ending of the cold war, the threat has become less acute, but it has not gone away. There are still enough nuclear weapons stockpiled to kill us all, and their use might be triggered by an accident that convinced a country that it was under attack. There is now a new danger from small and potentially unstable countries acquiring nuclear weapons. Such minor nuclear powers might cause millions of deaths, but they would not threaten the survival of the entire human race, unless they sparked a conflict between the major powers. These dangers of asteroid collision and nuclear war, have now been joined by a host of other threats to our survival. Climate change is happening at an ever increasing rate. While we are hoping to stabilise it, and maybe even reverse it, by reducing our CO2 emissions, the danger is that the climate change may pass a tipping point at which the temperature rise becomes self sustaining. The melting of the Arctic and Antarctic ice reduces the amount of solar energy that is reflected back into space and so increases the temperature further. The rise in sea temperature may trigger the release of large quantities of CO2, trapped at the bottom of the ocean, which will further increase the greenhouse effect. Let's hope we don't end up like our sister planet Venus with a temperature of 250C and raining sulphuric acid. There are other dangers, such as the accidental or intentional release of a genetically engineered virus. Each time we increase our technological powers, we add new possible ways in which things could go disastrously wrong. The human race faces an increasingly dangerous future. There's a sick joke that the reason we haven't been visited by aliens is that when a civilisation reaches our stage of development, it becomes unstable and destroys itself. In fact, I think there are other reasons why we haven't seen any aliens, but the story shows how perilous the situation is. The long-term survival of the human race will be safe only if we spread out into space, and then to other stars. This won't happen for at least 100 years so we have to be very careful. Perhaps, we must hope that genetic engineering will make us wise and less aggressive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/feb/06/thesecretsecureenergysolut","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2007-02-06T14:30:00Z","webTitle":"Kept in the dark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/06/thesecretsecureenergysolut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/06/thesecretsecureenergysolut","fields":{"headline":"Kept in the dark","bodyText":"I first came across concentrated solar power (CSP) because I've always been interested in water issues. Twenty years ago I heard that the Saudis were boiling seawater with the natural gas from their oil fields. They did this to desalinate water but hadn't taken into consideration the enormous amount of steam they were getting. In the end they couldn't say whether the distilled water was a by-product of the electricity that they were able to generate or vice versa. My view was if there was a sustainable substitute for the natural gas we could provide most of the clean water that the world needs. This is just the beginning; so read on, I believe that this is the energy of the future. The basic technology is extremely simple. The ancient Greeks used it to set fire to enemy warships. CSP uses parabolic mirrors to concentrate the suns heat (not to be confused with PV Photovoltaic). CSP works best in hot desert. There are hot deserts within 3,000 miles of 90% of the worlds population eg North and South America, North and South Africa, Australia, India, Middle East etc. New power stations are being built in the US that are projected to be able to deliver electricity at 2.5p per kWh, which is half the price of nuclear. Nuclear is projected to cost 5p per kWh but probably coming in closer to 8p. Unlike nuclear, which can only survive with huge public subsidy, CSP has the capability of unsubsidised competitiveness and unlike nuclear, it is carbon-free, clean and safe. It uses solar energy, which is free, renewable and infinite in supply. CSP has none of the unresolved dangerous waste issues of nuclear, nor would it be at risk from terrorist attack. Small CSP power stations installed in a very small proportion of the US deserts could generate most of America's energy needs. Bush and Blair have shown no interest in promoting a strategy for using CSP for energy and climate security, despite evidence showing that the resource is huge and that the technology could deliver energy cost effectively. In 2000, on being elected the Bush Administration requested the termination of CSP, despite the success of established CSP power stations over the last 15 years. The National Academy of Sciences, coerced by the US department of energy, then re-evaluated the concentrated solar technologies. The re-evaluation was forced after an earlier negative report issued by the academy which had no verifiable industry input. Under the watchful eye of the DoE, the academy contracted independent utility power engineering and analysis firm Sargent and Lundy to review the technologies. The report, issued in 2003, showed concentrated solar to be viable with attainable costs of 4-6 cents (US) per kWh for solar troughs. A 26,000km squared farm in south-western America could provide as much electricity as is needed to power the entire country. A macro CSP project by a non-governmental organisation called Trans Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation (Trec) comprising European and African members, have put forward a cooperative plan for powering Saharan countries and the EU using a network of low loss grid lines linked to very large CSP schemes in the Sahara. Developed by a German NGO in conjunction with the German government and German Aerospace Centre, Trec demonstrates that an area 250 sq miles in the Moroccan-Algerian Sahara can generate all of Europe's electricity needs. An area of 450 sq miles can generate the global energy requirements as projected for 2030. The electricity would be delivered by DC power lines that have a far lower loss of energy in transmission than AC, thereby liberating Europe and the world of its dependence on such unreliable energy providers as Russia, Iran and Iraq etc. Areas on the map of the size as indicated by the red squares would be sufficient for solar thermal power plants to generate as much electricity as is currently consumed by the world and by Europe (data provided by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), 2005). The global marketing initiative (GMI) for concentrating solar power SolarPACES Report (p. 12) puts forward a global map categorising all countries according to how appropriately located they are for CSP plants. Schemes along coastal areas could also desalinate very large quantities of seawater into drinking or irrigation water and provide enough electricity to pump it anywhere. Costal regions within the highlighted areas in the map in the SolarPACES report would be highly suitable for CSP desalination. In fact these are the areas of the world that suffer from the most extreme water shortages. There almost seems to be a conspiracy to keep this in the dark. CSP was not even included in Princeton University's 15 carbon wedges despite the fact that it is capable of delivering more electricity than all of them put together. A micro application of CSP for the developing world is to provide cheap to build off-grid local CSP power stations. It can also be used for low tech solar cooking and incredibly simple and cheap new methods of water pasteurisation, which could impact the annual death of 5 million children from water borne diseases and cause a reduction in deaths from smoke inhalation (WHO estimates 1.6 million people die annually from hazards related to the use of biomass for cooking fuel). Solar cooking impacts many other environmental and humanitarian issues such as deforestation; 1bn tonnes of firewood are being cut every year for cooking fuel, women's protection, medical sterilisation in rural hospitals and water desalination. Despite the thunderous impact CSP can have on poverty reduction the UN has deselected it from eligibility for the UN clean development mechanism (CDM) funding on a feeble red tape pretext. CDM funding is only available for projects involving aforestation or reforestation. Since at the minimum, solar cooking can help stop deforestation and can cut a gigantic amount of CO2 emissions this seems insane. To date, the Guardian is one of the only major newspapers to carry a comprehensive story on CSP despite the phenomenal relevance of this technology in today's troubled times. Most MPs and scientists are completely ignorant of its implications, energy security and cost effectiveness let alone its existence. It is high time everybody, including Bush and Blair, did something about it. It is important that world leaders actually lead the way in providing an environmentally sound, safe energy supply that helps to combat climate change rather than taking us along the incredibly dangerous and short-term nuclear route to armageddon. Germany is hosting the G8 this year, so given Angela Merkel's and the German Government's involvement in the development of CSP technology and the prioritisation of Africa, energy security, climate change and carbon emission reduction, CSP should be at the top of the G8 agenda. CSP is extremely economically competitive, more competitive than nuclear, oil, coal and gas and it boasts a free infinite supply of it's raw material. We should all know about this and yet nobody does. Ultimately, energy decisions are economic. CSP is the missing piece of the renewable jigsaw puzzle. The sustainable alternative to nuclear and the secure energy supply of the future. http://www.katharinehamnett.com/"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"katine/2007/oct/20/about","type":"article","sectionId":"katine","sectionName":"Katine","webPublicationDate":"2007-10-20T09:18:18Z","webTitle":"Can we, together, lift one village out of the Middle Ages?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/20/about","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/katine/2007/oct/20/about","fields":{"headline":"Can we, together, lift one village out of the Middle Ages?","bodyText":"With the right flight connections, a journey from the 21st century to the 14th century can take just over 12 hours. It begins in the hot, crowded duty-free hell of Heathrow's terminal 3 and ends - through the bushes down a snaking mud track - by the marshes under a cloudless blue African sky. In front of us five women are doing what the women in these parts have done for thousands of years - fetching the water for evening cooking and washing. Dressed in luminous greens and pinks, they return with their heavy yellow cans and hoist them on their heads for the long trail back to their huts. A few minutes later we're in an African village straight from the pages of childhood story books. Half a dozen mud and grass-thatched houses circle an ever-changing cast of clucking hens, goats and children. There is no sound apart from the chickens and chatter of voices, young and old. This is Katine, in northern Uganda, which for the next three years will be the centre of a unique experiment between a newspaper, its readership, a bank and an NGO. Together, we're going to try to help the people who live here to make a significant difference - harnessing the power of 21st century communications, expertise, resources and good will to help change lives still trapped in the 14th century. The centurial metaphor is from the Oxford economist Paul Collier, who has spent a lifetime studying Africa. In his recent book he writes of the world's bottom billion, who \"coexist with the 21st century, but their reality is the 14th century: civil war, plague, ignorance\". Katine has had its fair share of all three. Our experiment will not be uncontroversial: little to do with aid or development is. The first, and most obvious, question is, why intervene at all in a way of life that has changed little in hundreds of years? It is a troubling question that niggles away throughout our visit. There will be plenty of people - on both left and right of the development argument - who may ask, why Katine, or even, why bother? The answer for me began to harden as I spoke to one of the women collecting the water in that idyllic-seeming scene I'd just witnessed, hot off the plane. She turned out to be called Joyce Abuko, a 30-year old mother of five children who also looks after three children of her husband's co-wife and four more children left orphans by Aids. So 12 lives in all depend on Joyce. They depend on her rising early in the single mud-floored room she shares with some of the children, some of the chickens, her cooking pans and her food. Twelve lives depend on her cooking, her gardening, her cleaning, her fetching and carrying. They depend on her for their health, their education and their security. They need her to be strong and in good health herself. But the odds are heavily stacked against Joyce. Start with the water. The borehole she and her friends use has been swamped by the catastrophic floods which have hit central and eastern Africa this year, displacing up to 300,000 Ugandans - very probably the result of climate change caused by the affluent other world of which Joyce has no knowledge or conception. The swamps are host to malaria, bilharzia and jigger worms, which burrow into human skin and can cause secondary infections, including tetanus and gangrene. Joyce confesses she is too tired - and, anyway, doesn't have enough time in her day - to boil the water before her children drink and wash in it. I could only find evidence of one, hole-ridden, malaria net. So, sooner or later, Joyce and those in her care will end up in the local health centre. At first glance it looks impressive enough: a series of long brick huts, with even an operating theatre. But, as with so much about Katine, appearances are deceptive. There is no electricity or running water, few malaria nets and a quite inadequate supply of drugs. The operating theatre, opened with some ceremony by President Yoweri Museveni's wife a year ago, has never been used. On the day we visited, the place had a feeling of hopelessness and decay about it. A solitary ambulance stood unused in the long grass, waiting for spare parts. A charcoal stove was the only way of sterilising equipment in the delivery room; a single paraffin lamp the only means of light after dark. Medical record keeping was rudimentary, with only a quarter of the local population tested for HIV. Government figures suggest that Joyce will be lucky to live beyond 46. She has a one in four chance of dying from malaria. Joyce's brood stand little opportunity of improving their lot through education. They must travel long distances to get to school by 7.30am. There is no food for the children during the day: by mid-morning even those who made it in have begun to drift off home. Sanitation is poor - five holes in the ground for a notional roll of 650 children - and no water. Girls stay at home when menstruating and many drop out of education early through pregnancy or marriage. As at the hospital, there was a forlorn air about Katine primary school the day we called in. The teacher who greeted us was initially upbeat and welcoming. But as she recited a litany of problems - few text books, classes of up to 130, poor accommodation for teachers and so on - the life sagged out of her. I watched as a class of listless 10-year-olds struggled with an aimless lesson in creationism. There was more spirit up the road at the local Community primary school - started by a group of parents - but with even more basic conditions. Children sat on mud floors or rough hewn logs under grass roofs open to rain. The sum total of written texts amounted to seven Bibles. The seven teachers (between 350 children) wrote in the dust for lack of slates. So much for plague and ignorance. The last in Paul Collier's trilogy of 14th century disasters - civil war - has also been visited on Katine. Of the two main rebel groups operating in northern Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has wreaked the most havoc - looting, raping, mutilating and killing numerous residents and abducting countless thousands of children in the name of the religious fanatic, Joseph Kony. I met one young man - still worried about giving his full name - who had found his way back to Katine after a year of abduction. He had been kidnapped at 17 and spent a year of forced marches, sometimes roped to hundreds of other young men. He described how they had looted their way across the country. He spoke of seeing numerous killings; of ears and hands sliced off; of friends branded with red hot pangas; of raids on terrorised farmers and terrifying battles with the Ugandan army. As many as 5,000 refugees from neighbouring areas established a displaced persons camp in Katine in 2003, placing further strain on the local infrastructure, further weakened by the LRA cutting the power supply, which has never been reconnected. There are still 250 people living in the camp, too terrified to return to their homes. Janet Adwo, 24, showed me inside the cramped hut that has been home for her and her two children for four years - all of them sleeping on a rag mattress with no mosquito net. In a nearby hut a 65-year-old man sucking ajon (millet-based hooch) through a hollow twig told of the calamities he had lived through recently. He fiercely rounded on a pair of laughing girls. \"There are things I do not like to speak of in their presence,\" he said. \"Young children killed by bamboo sticks pushed through their anuses.\" The girls fell silent. The area has also been subject to repeated raids from the Karamajong tribesmen, armed with AK47s as they rounded up and stole all the cattle they could find. Farmers have had to fall back on crop production, but with negligible markets for their food. So, that is life in Katine. These are people with almost nothing bar the clothes they stand up in and the patchy grass roofs over their heads. They are living on fine margins between a hard life and early death. For all this hardship and misery, Katine does not feel like a hopeless society: far from it. The community is full of heroines like Joyce. It is impossible not to be struck by an immense warmth and resilience ... and a fierce ambition to do better. It is quite hard to see how this \"sub-county\" - we are talking of a dispersed community of about 20,000 people - is going to do better on its own. Development economists have their varying theories to explain how countries such as Uganda and places such as Katine end up so desperately poor. Malaria, physical geography, poor governance, fiscal failure, trade and conflict are among the standard explanations - all of them applicable to Katine. Professor Collier would also point to Uganda being landlocked between Kenya, itself stagnant for 30 years; Sudan, gripped by civil war; Rwanda, devastated by genocide; Somalia, which simply collapsed; the Congo, laid low by years of catastrophic conflict; and Tanzania, which invaded it. He is also clear that in seeking to help places such as Katine we cannot rescue them. \"The societies of the bottom billion can only be rescued from within,\" he writes. \"In every society of the bottom billion there are people working for change, but usually they are defeated by powerful internal forces stacked against them. We should be helping the heroes. So far, our efforts have been paltry: through inertia, ignorance, and incompetence, we have stood by and watched them lose.\" He adds: \"A future world with a billion people living in impoverished and stagnant countries is just not a scenario we can countenance. A cesspool of misery next to a world of growing prosperity is both terrible for those in the cesspool and dangerous for those who live next to it. We had better do something about it. The question is what.\" Translating ambitions The question is what? Most western journalists periodically scratch their heads about how to keep some subjects fresh, including poverty and climate change. The big picture is known; the facts change little from day to day. Such subjects are at once the biggest news of our times - and not news at all. Like all newspapers, the Guardian and Observer promote annual appeals to focus attention on worthwhile causes during the pre-Christmas giving season. Would it be possible to find a way of dramatising an issue so that it held attention beyond Christmas, even for as long as three years? Of connecting the ideas, goodwill, resources and expert knowledge of 15 million readers around the world and focusing them on one problem? Would it be possible to do all this in a way which avoided the classic trap of creating a temporary oasis in a desert? Of doing something both sustainable and replicable? Could there be a model for using web-based technologies - and the power to link and harness people - that could be developed by other western communities, whether businesses, schools or towns? Why twin your village with one in Belgium if you could twin it with one in Uganda? Such were our thoughts as we sought partners who could translate our ambitions into practical realities. Assorted NGOs came in and pitched their ideas for how such a project might work. It was Amref - a charity which specialises in Africa and which began life in 1957 as the Flying Doctor service - which came up with the most persuasive ideas. Amref, whose staff is 97% African, nominated Katine, in the Soroti district of north Uganda, as the community they would most like to work with. They emphasised that the project would only take root if it could be the catalyst for change rather than something imposed from outside. It would take advantage of - and build on - existing social and economic networks as well as traditional and indigenous knowledge. We have been joined by Farm Africa, a vastly experienced NGO used to working with poor African farmers, and Barclays Bank, which has promised £1.5m in support (£1m of that to match readers' donations) as well as helping out with micro-finance and general economic development. As for the Guardian and Observer, we have sent a number of writers and photographers to Katine to map and record the area and its people, including Sarah Boseley, our health editor, John Vidal, our environmental editor, and Dan Chung, one of the world's leading photo-journalists. Sarah and Dan's detailed report appears in a separate supplement and on the website (theguardian.com/katine) It seems to me that a newspaper (plus, of course, its web operation) can do three things as part of this partnership. · Firstly, it can report, record, explain, contextualise, illuminate and analyse: all the day-to-day business of journalism. It can explore the complexities of trying to help communities such as Katine in a sustainable way. It should be able to get beyond the sloganising and occasional yah-boo politics of the development debate. · Secondly, it can involve a huge community of readers and web-users around the world and find ways of linking them in to what we're doing. We'll need money obviously. But, just as importantly we need advice and involvement. Among our readers are water engineers, doctors, solar energy experts, businessmen and women, teachers, nurses, farmers. We absolutely don't need a stampede of volunteers, but we would like a technical know-how bank of people who are prepared to offer time and advice. We'll let you know how to get involved as we go. · Finally, it can achieve visibility for (and thus pressure on behalf of) Katine. Katine and its problems barely register in the capital, Kampala. Some local officials worry that, because it is an area where the political opposition to Mr Museveni's NRM party is strong, Katine's problems may not have been among the government's highest priorities. That may be unfair, but the fact remains that this is one of the poorest, least developed areas of Uganda. Now for the hard bit. For a newspaper campaign, three years is long stretch: in terms of a sustainable aid project it is relatively short and sharp. Some of the most rooted and important work - training, reliable information and record keeping, supply systems and so on - is unglamorous and invisible to the naked eye. But there will be more obvious, and more easily recordable, progress. We want mosquito nets - thousands of them; bicycles - hundreds of them; solar panels - dozens of them. We'll need books, footballs, buildings, boreholes, pumps, computers and much else. Through the website we'll show tangible evidence of progress and keep you in touch with our needs. The niggling question Back to that niggling question: why intervene? On one level it is a simple question. Here are people within our reach and knowledge whose lives are quite brutally shortened by preventable disease, hunger and ignorance. They are people with virtually no earthly possessions and no carbon footprint, whose lives are likely to be made harder still by the climate change caused by people infinitely richer in belongings and education. To do nothing is, on this level, unthinkable. But you can't help worry about doing the wrong thing. After Joyce Abuko had described her average day to me - a treadmill of fetching, carrying, cooking, cleaning, hoeing, weeding, thrashing and grinding in order merely to survive - I asked her what single thing would most improve her life. She thought for a moment and answered: \"I love sitting down with my friends. I would like more time to talk.\" Just that, no more. Katine is no Garden of Eden. But, as you brace yourself to elbow your way back through Heathrow terminal 3, you harbour niggling prelapsarian feelings about what you've just left behind. So you want Joyce and the 12 children who depend on her to stand a better chance of a life without preventable disease and hunger. You want to help Katine stand in its own two legs and to exist without conflict, displacement and famine. But you also want to move gently and with the greatest possible sensitivity to the culture you have, briefly, witnessed, shared - and honoured. That is the challenge we have set ourselves. Over the next three years we will share it with you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2006/aug/24/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-23T23:17:55Z","webTitle":"Letters, August 24","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/aug/24/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2006/aug/24/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection","fields":{"headline":"Read this week's letters and blogs","bodyText":"iPods do play MP3s I think statements such as: \"iTunes' mainstream Windows Media-based competitors cannot break their nemesis's stranglehold.

Brian Wedge, Berkhamsted, Herts Laws online In your article (Access denied to the laws that govern us, August 17), you comment that Halsbury's Statutes is available in \"hard copy or online\". This is not the case. LexisNexis Butterworths, which publish Halsbury's Statutes, does have an online equivalent, but the material for that is actually prepared by a completely separate department to that which prepares the material for Halsbury's - and as such, there are differences between the material online and in hard copy. Anthony Fairclough, former senior editor, Halsbury's Statutes &amp; Statutory Instruments · I was interested to read your article about access to the law. I note that you list a number of free sources but did not mention our website, www.lawreports.co.uk, which publishes free summaries of key judgments which are likely to be reported within 24 hours of judgment. We also publish law reports and statutes in print and license electronic versions to Justis, WestLaw, and Lexis. John Cobbett, secretary, the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales, London · Your interesting article about online legal resources is said to be about something called \"British law\". There is no such thing. There is English law and Scots law. Loads of commonalities, of course, but entirely separate legal systems, legislation and case law. It's not that the sources quoted would be inadequate, it's much more that they would be just plain wrong and misleading to the reader. Ann Caldwell, Edinburgh Solar pricing In the article Solar energy is hot stuff (August 17), you said the following: \"With the average household's electricity bill above £900 (and set to rise again with British Gas's latest price rises), solar panels start to make sense at £4,000, after you've received a government grant available for installation.\" You greatly exaggerate the electricity bill. Most references I have seen estimate the \"average\" household consumption as 4,000-4,700 kilowatt-hours a year. The British Wind Energy Association uses 4,700 in all its statements concerning the output of wind farms. My own is around 4,900, in a fairly big house. Even after the latest price rises, this means that the average domestic electricity bill will be under £500. And have you tried to get one of the government grants? They impose some extraordinary conditions, and I understand that all this year's budget has run out. There is also the problem of making sure you get paid appropriately for any electricity units you export, without which solar panels are an even poorer investment.

Customers who want to keep up with Tory leader David Cameron, who plans to install a wind turbine on his roof, can pick up solar panels at three London branches of the high street store, in Fulham, Croydon and West Thurrock. Currys is taking a risk as the solar panels will cost far more than anything else the store sells. They say it will cost the average three bedroom household about £9,000 to buy and install solar panels - compared to £16,000 in specialist stores. There are also grants available through the Low Carbon Buildings Programme. Customers opting for solar power can expect to reduce their energy bill by up to 50% and could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to two tons per year. In addition, up to half of the cost of the panels can be offset by an increase in property value, Currys said. But it will take a long time to recoup the initial outlay, as customers will have to wait between seven and 18 years to see their investment pay off. In announcing the trial sales of solar panels, Peter Keenan, managing director for Currys, said: \"Our customers are becoming more environmentally aware all the time. But this is far more than a 'green solution' for the home. It is also a perfect way of safeguarding against seemingly inevitable energy price rises.\" British Gas and EDF last week announced yet more price rises, pushing average household fuel bills in the UK to around £1,000 a year, according to consumer group Energywatch. For customers who decide to take the solar route, Currys will offer an in-store consultation and customers with suitable houses will be offered a house assessment free of charge. Should the house be capable of supporting the technology - and most are - installation of the solar panels on the property's roof should take just one or two days. \"Technological advances mean that the solar panels are perfectly adapted to the UK climate,\" Currys said. \"Customers investing in solar panels for the home will see instant as well as long-term reductions to their electricity bills, as well as a potential increase to the value of their property.\" Should Currys decide to sell solar panels on a wider basis, solar energy could receive a big boost. The firm is Britain's biggest electrical retailer with a network of more than 550 stores nationwide. Industry analysts predict £750m in sales in 2010 from a \"standing start\" now. The price of solar panels is also expected to fall, in line with the reduction in price of other electrical goods such as flat-panel televisions. The panels are manufactured by Sharp UK, which has a factory in Wrexham, north Wales. Sharp has a 26% share of the solar panels market. Juliet Davenport, the chief executive of the renewables energy firm, Good Energy, welcomed Currys' move but wondered about the practicalities. \"Will Currys take care of the installation or get involved in helping customers get grants from the Low Carbon Buildings Programme?\" she asked. \"Unless Currys takes the hassle out of buying solar panels, it could be hard for sales to really take off - quite apart from the cost.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2006/jun/03/workandcareers.graduate","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2006-06-03T00:57:15Z","webTitle":"First class","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/jun/03/workandcareers.graduate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2006/jun/03/workandcareers.graduate","fields":{"headline":"First class","bodyText":"Nano state The University of Oxford has launched a new course - a part-time postgraduate degree in nanotechnology, taught entirely online.

With shelves sparsely stacked with beers and tinned vegetables, Flashy’s Place, as it’s known, is a cross between a bar and a corner shop. Playing dominoes and watching the evening news, a group of local men of all ages is sitting here tonight, like almost every other, unwinding after a day’s work. The hut can be no more than five metres square, and yet it is quite the social hub. Flashy is being economical with the truth, I later discover, but only slightly. It turns out that there was one incident, a robbery several years ago, but that was committed by an “outsider”. Still, it’s an impressive record, and no crime is just the beginning. The little west Jamaican town of Accompong has another secret, one that you’d think would belie the first. There are also no police. And, to the envy of us all, no taxes. “A nation within a nation,” is how little-known Accompong has been described. It was here in 1739 that runaway Maroon slaves signed a peace treaty with the British to gain semi-sovereignty over the area. Today, the treaty still stands. The town is run by an elected “colonel”, the state can only interfere in the case of a capital crime, and residents continue to live a peaceful life - a life that a growing number of tourists are keen to experience. Miles from the celebrated white sands and all-inclusive resorts, the town lies in the heart of Cockpit Country, where you can find places with the enchanting names of Me No Sen You No Come, the Land of Lookbehind, Wait-a-Bit and Quick Step. Getting to Accompong involves a short 30-minute drive from the not-so-enchantingly named Maggotty in St Elizabeth parish, and a certain amount of courage as you wind round a succession of treacherous blind corners. Up until the 1980s, the town’s gates were locked and outsiders had to seek permission to enter, but now visitors can come and go freely. Motorbike mashup Flashy is the first to spot me as I drive through the gates. He heads straight over to greet me, limping slightly from a recent motorbike “mashup”, but no less enthusiastic. After helping to arrange my room for the night, he soon becomes one of my main points of contact during my stay. Official guesthouses are thin on the ground, but most residents will open their homes to you for a small fee. Many will also arrange your meals. Local favourites are slow-roasted jerk pork and stews of freshly picked vegetables such as dasheen, breadfruit, plantain and cho-cho. Similarly, you’ll have no shortage of tour guides willing to take you to the town’s two main sights: the town museum, which holds an assortment of excavated relics, traditional musical instruments and details of ceremonial practices; and the Peace Cave, where the Accompong peace treaty was signed by the community’s founder, Colonel Cudjoe. The latter is found a short hike out of town. In exchange for a few dollars, a local named Mark offers to be my chaperone, but not before we collect a phial of rum to sprinkle on the sacred ground “for the spirits”. Accompong town is concentrated around one main road running up the hill, but the surrounding countryside is vast - somewhere between the 15,000 acres the slaves were originally promised and the 1,500 acres recorded on the written treaty (where a crucial zero was mislaid). As we trek along a series of unmarked, overgrown paths to the Peace Cave, the craggy hills reveal plenty of hiking opportunities. Every now and again, Mark stops walking and points out plants used for traditional herbal remedies. “This is a carcoon,” he says, holding up a cross between a conker and a large kidney bean. “It’s a typical Maroon food and we also use it to check if water is OK to drink. If it floats, it’s good.” Maroons are extremely proud of their traditions and living off the earth has enabled a large percentage of them to live to more than 100 years old. Island paradise Hiking through such idyllic natural surroundings, without another person in sight, I feel like I have stumbled upon the island’s true paradise. Yet there’s more to this tax-free, crime-free living than meets the eye. Although residents are keen to retain their freedom and cultural identity, raising their own funds for community projects, maintenance and development is not easy. “Farming just isn’t viable anymore,” Deputy Colonel Rupert Robinson (aka Colonel Robbie) tells me later on the porch of his home-cum-guesthouse. “Tourism has to be number one now.” Accompong is no place for high-maintenance types who need to be kept busy and entertained, but culture-hungry travellers looking to get off the beaten track will be in their element. However, if you’re looking for a quiet getaway, get your timing right. Roll into town around January 6, and you could have a rather different experience. At the beginning of the year, this rural enclave becomes west Jamaica’s biggest party town. The annual Maroon Festival to honour Colonel Cudjoe draws in up to 15,000 visitors, quite an increase on the trickle of people who arrive through the rest of the year. Although the festival is yet to build an international reputation, it brings in coachloads of visitors from across the island, and an increasing number of in-the-know foreigners. The day starts with a ceremony at the Peace Cave paying respect to Maroon ancestors, which is followed by feasting, dancing and traditional myal drumming. It all culminates in a giant parade and a sound-system dance party that continues throughout the night. Jamaicans don’t need an excuse to party, so when there’s a good one things certainly get lively. Half of me is disappointed to be leaving just before the town starts to buzz with festival preparations, but the other half feels privileged to have been able to escape the crowds, gain an insight into everyday Maroon life and experience such an individual welcome. “You’re not staying for the celebrations?” asks Flashy. “You should come back and see how different it is.” I must admit I’m tempted, although as I watch the sun set over the Appleton Valley to a soundtrack of chirping crickets, everything seems irie just the way it is. Getting there Car hire in Jamaica costs around US$50-60 (£25-30) per day. From Montego Bay (via Elderslie), head to Retirement and Accompong is signposted from there. From Black River or Santa Cruz, travel to Lacovia and then north through Maggotty and Retirement.

The 62-megawatt plant, which will use 350,000 solar panels spread over an area the size of 150 football pitches, represents a leap forward for solar energy as it moves out of small-scale use into producing electricity in large quantities. The €250m (£168m) Girassol plant will be 12 times the size of the biggest solar power plant currently in operation near Leipzig in Germany. \"The construction of the power station will begin in 2006,\" Moura's mayor, Jose Maria Pos-de-Mina, told journalists. The Girassol plant will be located in one of the poorest regions of Portugal, the sun-baked Alentejo. Those involved in the project say it will allow solar power to start competing with wind power as a large-scale generator of renewable energy. \"Photo-voltaic power is anecdotal at the moment compared to other power station sources. With this, it can start to become a player,\" Francisco Conesa, commercial director for BP Solar in southern Europe, said yesterday. Despite its green credentials, the Girassol project will have a huge visual impact on the largely unspoilt Alentejo. It will cover 112 hectares in the valley of Baldio das Ferrarias, an area equivalent in size to three-quarters of London's Hyde Park, with solar panels. The Moura station is still awaiting its licence from the Portuguese ministry for industry. That will set the final price at which the clean electricity can be sold into the national grid. Girassol's owners have lobbied for a significant premium over non-renewable power sources because it will not generate serious ecological costs in the future. Local people will, through their town hall, be taking on much of the financial risk for the project. Moura's town hall holds 90% of the capital in Amper. BP Solar will build a solar panel factory at the site, which it says will create 240 full-time jobs. Girassol is planned to come on line in 2009."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2007/jan/04/insideit.guardianweeklytechnologysection","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2007-01-04T23:41:08Z","webTitle":"Whatever happened to the future?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jan/04/insideit.guardianweeklytechnologysection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2007/jan/04/insideit.guardianweeklytechnologysection","fields":{"headline":"Whatever happened to the future?","bodyText":"What could be more futuristic than 2007? But life in the early 21st century tells us otherwise: no flying cars, no dinners in a pill, and certainly no cool rocketing off to space cities in the required outfit of the future (shaved heads and Bacofoil jumpsuits). We seem to have failed the expectations of the most wild-eyed seers from the past - futurologists who were for the most part in love with a supercharged, technologically sexy future where science would free us from the daily grind for holidays on the moon or underseas. But here we remain, plodding along somewhere between Orwell and Huxley in a familiar world that is neither utopia nor dystopia. In our conservative, cost- and safety-conscious, paranoid, post-cold war world, the big ideas, the truly revolutionary concepts - space tourism, android domestic help, etc - simply haven't materialised. What the futurologists did get right, however, were some of the more prosaic details that define us proto-21st-century-types, such as mobile phones and digital technologies. Japan was particularly attuned to where technological development was heading 47 years ago. About 40% of the 135 advanced technologies predicted in 1960 to become reality by 2010 by Japan's Science and Technology Agency, set up by the government to help decide where R&amp;D should go, have actually done so. And they're not all self-fulfilling prophecies either; most are non-Japanese inventions. Accurate predictions Mobile phones, microwave ovens, artificial insemination, permanent preservation of sperm, desalination and a voice-activated typewriter able to turn speech into text are just some of the things on the agency's list, which included 54 correct predictions. Heavy investment in areas highlighted by the agency certainly helped their future realisation, and goes some way to explain why cities like Tokyo are seen as futuristic while ours - hello, Victorian sewerage and transport systems - seem backward. \"Britain could have led the world in developing the internet and computer games if the government had listened to the advice of a former editor of New Scientist [Nigel Calder] three decades ago,\" wrote Mick Hamer in New Scientist in 1994. Hamer was revisiting predictions made by New Scientist's special issue on the future in 1964, many of which came true but were ignored by Whitehall. More forward-thinking than the British, Americans too can tally up some major hits in past predictions; but anyone reading the New York Times in 1950 might have been seriously misdirected. In \"Miracles You'll See In The Next Fifty Years\", its science editor stuck his neck out to predict such things as \"sawdust and wood pulp converted into sugary foods\". Lucky children would be treated to \"discarded paper table 'linen' and rayon underwear bought by chemical factories to be converted into candy.\" Past blunders The New York Times's mistakes, like many wild claims of the same period, stemmed from extrapolating hot areas of research at the time. When the US got it right it was during earlier, less developed times. The prize for the best informed predictions must go to the extraordinary seer-like minds of the writers for a 1900 issue of Ladies Home Journal, who wrote: \"Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electronically with screens at the opposite ends of circuits, thousands of miles at a span\" and \"photographs will be telegraphed from any distance\". The internet? They also predicted the rise of the car, fridges, air-conditioning, zoned traffic and x-rays used in medicine. There's no doubt technological divination is a tricky business, says Ian Pearson, head of BT's Foresight and Futurology Unit, a BT Group think tank. He has correctly forecast the rise of SMS, the search engine and interactive digital TV. There have been some misses, too, including virtual reality, whose allure he vastly overestimated. \"We predicted video-conferencing decades ago but we didn't think it would be through PCs, but dreamt up huge mahogany affairs instead. We did think of PCs, but not printers; thinking instead that you'd put a Polaroid against the screen to take a snap.\" Tricky indeed. Below, we've outlined some key areas or modern life where past fortune-tellers were sure we would or wouldn't make technological strides. Enjoy reading with perfect 20/20 hindsight; unfortunately the 3D version isn't available. Past predictions too often make hilarious reading rather than accurate forecasts Transport: come fly with me In 1940, Henry Ford said: \"Mark my word: a combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come.\" We are still smiling, Henry. The flying car stalled long ago, along with a wish list that included the commercial production of personal jets, helicopters, hovercrafts and jet cars. There are \"skycars\" and jet cars still knocking around laboratories but no commercial carplanes as yet. Pragmatists point to the air traffic control nightmare if should they start to fill the skies. One recent development that may take us closer to a personal flying saucer is from SPR Ltd, a small Havant-based company, which has successfully tested an experimental engine using patented microwave technology to convert solar energy directly into thrust - that is, an engine that could behave like an antigravity machine. The government has just given a grant to the company to build a prototype, according to New Scientist. Back in the same magazine in 1964 Professor Ian Fells saw things very nearly accurately when he talked of fuel cells driving electric motors. He now admits progress has been slower than he had hoped. Communications: missed call Alexander Graham Bell was overmodest when he predicted: \"One day there would be a telephone in every American city\". Some Japanese writers were way ahead of him. A 1901 edition of the Hochi Newspaper predicted, among other prescient ideas, the invention of wireless telephony (mobile phones), a technology where Japan still leads the world. The US lags in this sphere, so maybe it's not surprising to read in Laura Lee's book Bad Predictions that in 1984, US giant AT&amp;T rejected a free opportunity to enter the mobile phone market because its forecasts \"indicated only 900,000 units would be sold by 1995\". Computers: slow counting Although widely foreseen as becoming useful tools, few came to predict what we might really use PCs for, while very few foresaw the rise of the PC. As IBM famously said in 1952: \"The total market for computers would amount to around 52 units\", only to raise its figures to the (in hindsight) still ludicrously low figure of 200,000 in the early 1980s. That is about the number shifted each week. Writing in New Scientist in 1964, Dr Maurice Wilkes predicted an \"international network of computers\" and the use of computers to crack the secrets of the genome, although like many he was a few years premature with his dates. 1984, he thought, would see this breakthrough. Space: not the place How retro-futuristic those Apollo moonshots seem to us now, and how soon their foregone evolution - crewed flights into deepest space - petered out, along with NASA funding for them. Around the time of the moon launches in the late 1960s, the US's Hudson Institute tried to guess what life would be like at the end of the century, and typically suggested space colonies and interstellar travel. Dr Richard van der Riet Woolley, Astronomer Royal and space adviser to the British government, said in 1956: \"Space travel is utter bilge.\" The next year Sputnik orbited the Earth. As it was, the moonshots went beyond anyone's expectations. Space colonisation hasn't taken off mostly because, as Sir Patrick Moore puts it, \"space is a very dangerous place for ordinary people\". · If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2006/sep/25/fightingthewrongwar","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-25T09:43:55Z","webTitle":"Fighting the wrong war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/25/fightingthewrongwar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/25/fightingthewrongwar","fields":{"headline":"Fighting the wrong war","bodyText":"It always comes back to oil. The continuing misguided interventions in the Middle East by the United States and the United Kingdom have their roots deep in the Arabian sand. Ever since Winston Churchill led the conversion of Britain's navy from coal to oil at the start of the last century, the Western powers have meddled incessantly in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries to keep the oil flowing, toppling governments and taking sides in wars in the supposed \"great game\" of energy resources. But the game is almost over, because the old approaches are obviously failing. Just when one is lulled into thinking that something other than oil is at the root of current US and UK action in Iraq, reality pulls us back. Indeed, President Bush recently invited journalists to imagine the world 50 years from now. He did not have in mind the future of science and technology, or a global population of nine billion, or the challenges of climate change and biodiversity. Instead, he wanted to know whether Islamic radicals would control the world's oil. Whatever we are worrying about in 50 years, this will surely be near the bottom of the list. Even if it were closer to the top, overthrowing Saddam Hussein to ensure oil supplies in 50 years ranks as the least plausible of strategies. Yet we know from a range of evidence that this is what was on Bush's mind when his government shifted its focus from the search for Osama bin Laden to fighting a war in Iraq. The overthrow of Saddam was the longstanding pet idea of the neoconservative Project for a New American Century, which was already arguing in the 1990's that Saddam was likely to achieve a stranglehold over \"a significant proportion of the world's oil supplies.\" Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated these fears in the run-up to the Iraq war, claiming that Saddam Hussein was building a massive arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to \"take control of a great portion of the world's energy supplies\". Cheney's facts were obviously wrong, but so was his logic. Dictators like Saddam make their living by selling their oil, not by holding it in the ground. Perhaps, though, Saddam was too eager to sell oil concessions to French, Russian, and Italian companies rather than British and US companies. In any event, the war in Iraq will not protect the world's energy supplies in 50 years. If anything, the war will threaten those supplies by stoking the very radicalism it claims to be fighting. Genuine energy security will come not by invading and occupying the Middle East, or by attempting to impose pliant governments in the region, but by recognizing certain deeper truths about global energy. First, energy strategy must satisfy three objectives: low cost, diverse supply, and drastically reduced carbon dioxide emissions. This will require massive investments in new technologies and resources, not a \"fight to the finish\" over Middle East oil. Important energy technologies will include conversion of coal to liquids (such as gasoline), use of tar sands and oil shale, and growth in non-fossil-fuel energy sources. Indeed, there is excellent potential for low-cost solar power, zero-emitting coal-based technologies, and safe and reliable nuclear power. Solar radiation equals roughly 10,000 times our current energy use. We tap that solar power in many fundamental ways - food production, wind power, hydroelectric power, solar heating, solar-thermal electricity, solar panels - but the possibilities for greatly increased use of inexpensive, widely available, and environmentally friendly solar power are huge. Coal, like solar energy, is widely available. It is already inexpensive, but it is a solid rather than a liquid, a major pollutant, and a source of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet all of these problems can be solved, especially if we make the needed investments in research and development. Gasification of coal allows for the removal of dangerous pollutants, and coal can already be converted to gasoline at low cost; a South African company is beginning to bring that technology to China on a large scale. Nuclear power, both fission-based and fusion-based, is yet another possibility for vast, reliable, secure, and environmentally safe primary energy. Here, too, there are technological obstacles, but they seem surmountable. Of course, there are also major political, regulatory, and security considerations, all of which need to be addressed properly. It is ironic that an administration fixated on the risks of Middle East oil has chosen to spend hundreds of billions - potentially trillions - of dollars to pursue unsuccessful military approaches to problems that can and should be solved at vastly lower cost, through R&amp;D, regulation, and market incentives. The biggest energy crisis of all, it seems, involves the misdirected energy of a US foreign policy built on war rather than scientific discovery and technological progress. ©Project Syndicate, 2006."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2006/aug/29/energy.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-29T14:14:59Z","webTitle":"Engineers race to steal nature's secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/aug/29/energy.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/aug/29/energy.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Engineers race to steal nature's secrets","bodyText":"A new generation of small green companies is emerging with radical but proven ideas to revolutionise engineering and create anything from intelligent fridges to colossal wind turbines moored at sea. The designers hope their projects will transform energy supplies and cut carbon emissions in the next 20 years. They include huge wind turbines, more powerful than any seen before, anchored to the seabed 20 miles off the coast; fridges that monitor the national grid to use less power; a desalination plant that is also a theatre; and a tidal lagoon that protects the coast while generating electricity. The new companies are rethinking major infrastructure projects using natural objects as their basis. The aero-generator turbine, now being laboratory tested before sea trials next year, mimics sycamore seeds that spin like propellers in the slightest breeze. Its twin arms could each be as tall as the Eiffel tower, and the structure could be moored like an oil platform in 450 feet of water. Each turbine, said Martin Pawlyn, an architect with Grimshaw - which developed the transparent \"biomes\" at the Eden Project in Cornwall - could produce 20 megawatts of electricity, nearly five times as much as any existing wind turbine. \"A cluster of 100 of them spread over just a few square miles of ocean, each turning at just a few revolutions a minute, could outperform almost all Britain's existing wind farms put together,\" he said. \"We are now learning from natural eco-systems, and are scaling up projects. We are going back to first principles, taking our inspiration from nature.\" The desalination plant, essential in countries that suffer water shortages, is also being rethought. Mostly banished to the edges of cities, they are disliked for needing large amounts of energy and looking like ill-designed boxes. Architects working with designer Charlie Paton have developed one that needs next to no energy and can double up as an open-air theatre. It has been proposed by Grimshaw for the city of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, historically short of fresh water. The structure, looking like a wall of glass and steel, uses simple evaporators and condensers to produce large quantities of fresh water. \"The inspiration came from the Namibian fog-basking beetle, which uses its shell as a condensing surface for moisture, which allows it to survive in the desert,\" said Mr Pawlyn. \"There are countless other examples like this that we can turn to when tackling some of the environmental issues that we now face.\" The idea has been used in three commercial greenhouses in the Middle East to grow food using salt water. Seawater cools and humidifies the air in the greenhouse and sunlight distils fresh water. A radical but simple design proposed for north Wales is a 15km-long tidal energy scheme that could generate up to 450 megawatts of power and protect the coastline from erosion and severe storms. It could be constructed from dredged sand and seabed material, or waste slate from disused Welsh quarries. Long rows of hydroelectric generators would turn and generate electricity as the tide rushes in and out. North Wales has some of the highest tidal ranges in the world. \"It would protect Rhyl and neighbouring towns with 30 linear miles of breakwater, reducing the risk of flooding disasters like the one in 1990. But it would not be visually intrusive. It works well with wind power, and it would even be possible to move it,\" said Mr Pawlyn. The scheme could also offer a natural but nearly invisible shelter, allowing a marina to be built and a depressed area of north Wales to be regenerated. \"We are trying to raise the utilitarian [infrastructure project] to another level. It's the idea of celebrating nature, and learning from it to rethink environmental problems,\" said Mr Pawlyn. Other ideas being developed include sewage treatment processes that generate 20% more electricity than usual, and giant solar heaters that would concentrate sunlight on to solar cells, producing 30 times as much electricity as today's cells. Mark Shorrock, a director of venture capital firm Low Carbon Accelerator, which is aiming to raise £50m to back dozens of small green technology companies, said the market for imaginative, new renewable energy technologies was taking off, and was expected to more than double in the next few years. Solar energy is expected to be a £50bn market by 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2006/may/27/supermarkets.asda","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-26T23:51:58Z","webTitle":"Asda hits back as Tesco takes the train to show its greener credentials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/may/27/supermarkets.asda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2006/may/27/supermarkets.asda","fields":{"headline":"Asda hits back as Tesco takes the train to show its greener credentials","bodyText":"Supermarket group Tesco took another step to improve its green credentials yesterday by unveiling a plan to move goods off the roads and on to the rail network. But it immediately ran into a clash with rival Asda over claims the switch would make Tesco \"the first UK retailer to move significant volumes from road to rail\". Wal-Mart-owned Asda has been transporting goods from south coast ports to northern depots by train since 2003 and accused Tesco of \"recycling our old news\". Tesco plans to start moving non-food products by rail from the Midlands to its main Scottish distribution centre in Livingston in the summer. It will be using \"purpose-built green trains\" imported from Canada. They will replace 20 lorry journeys a day. The company said the plan would save an estimated 4.5m road miles and around 6,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year and \"make sure goods are transported in the most environmentally-friendly way\" also reducing noise and vibration. The 1,300-strong chain has been facing mounting criticism that it steamrollers suppliers and small businesses. Chief executive Sir Terry Leahy said it was determined to be a \"good neighbour\". He denied that the plan - which was unveiled just one day after the supermarkets were referred to the competition commission for a full-scale inquiry - was part of an attempt to improve Tesco's reputation. He said it is merely reflecting the concerns of its shoppers. The initial investment is only £3.2m, but the trial may be extended, possibly to other routes, if it proves successful. Laurie McIlwee, distribution director, said that Tesco \"has led the way in developing an efficient supply chain which minimises impact on the environment\". Asda, however, immediately took issue with the Tesco claims. The Leeds-based group has been using rail to move food and general merchandise from south coast ports to northern depots for three years which, it says, saves 4.5m road miles a year. Last month Asda also opened a £20m deep-sea import facility at Teesport so that ships can unload directly to the north. The supermarket said the facility will save a further 1.5m road miles a year transporting goods from south to north. Wal-Mart - also stung by criticism of its impact on communities - recently set out an ambitious environmental programme including pledges to ensure it is supplied 100% by renewable energy and creates zero waste. Tesco's 10-point community plan included a £100m environmental fund to explore the feasibility of using alternative power, from solar energy to wind turbines on store roofs and gasifying waste food. It also included recycling initiatives, pledges to encourage healthy eating and fitness, and a promise to listen harder to any protests over new store plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2005/apr/08/energy.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2005-04-08T02:20:05Z","webTitle":"Sunny side down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/apr/08/energy.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2005/apr/08/energy.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Sunny side down","bodyText":"The solar energy industry is under a dark cloud. Amid growing suspicion that the government is about to pull the plug on grant money for early adopters of solar energy, the industry has openly accused Tony Blair of reneging on previous commitments. According to the Renewable Power Association (RPA), an umbrella organisation for renewable energy companies, the government plans to end its 2002-2012 programme for solar photovoltaics (PVs) - cells that convert solar radiation into electricity - prematurely in March next year. This means that the government will no longer give out grants for solar projects. The solar industry has relied on such capital grants to households and industry to build up domestic demand and hence a market for solar panels. It fears that once these grants dry up, demand will vanish and the market will collapse, and with it the UK solar industry. Since the government started its solar PV programme, the UK has seen the growth of a fledgling industry. Sharp UK has a manufacturing plant in Wrexham, Wales that employs 150 people, while firms such as Romag and BP Solar have plants in the north-east. The UK is also a world leader in the integrated solar PV market, with companies such as Marley and Solarcentury developing new solar tiles that have export as well UK potential. But uncertainty over the government's commitment to solar is causing mounting anxiety and anger within the solar power industry. The industry first expressed its concerns last November, but recently cranked up the volume. It is now openly accusing the government of bad faith and of not living up to its rhetoric on climate change. Jonathan Bates, a director of PV-UK, a solar industry group, said \"The UK PV industry has taken the government at its word and invested millions of pounds in response to the white paper commitment. This money will have been wasted and many of our members will find it hard to continue trading should the government now decide to abandon the industry as it did the nascent UK wind industry 20 years ago.\" Solar energy firms cite the 2003 energy white paper, which called for \"2002-2012 implementation of solar PV demonstration programme in line with our competitors as set out in the Opportunities for All white paper\". They also cite the principal recommendation of the government-industry PV group report of 2001, which called for a 10-year, £150m programme with a target of 70-100,000 roofs. Sebastian Berry, a policy manager at the RPA, told Guardian Unlimited: \"The bottom line is that the government has gone back on its previous commitments to a 10-year PV programme at a time when Tony Blair is stressing the need for more not less action on climate change.\" Faced with growing disgruntlement within the solar energy industry, the government insists that it remains strongly committed to long-term funding for solar power, an industry to which it has given £31m since 2002. The Department of Trade and Industry said in a statement: \"We have reassured the solar industry that we have a long-term commitment to them, and look forward to working with them on the new arrangements.\" But DTI officials have made it clear that the government favours wind and tidal power as renewable energy sources. \"The climate we have does not lend itself to solar energy and the government has to decide which kind of renewable power is most viable. The government has to prioritise,\" a DTI official said. So far, the UK has installed six megawatts (MW) and may have trouble meeting its target of nine megawatts - or the approximate equivalent of 3,000 domestic roofs - by this year. By contrast, Germany last year installed 300MW of solar PV and on 12 separate occasions since 1999 the German solar programme has delivered the equivalent of the UK's three-year target in just one month. The government has said it wants five per cent of the UK's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources this year, 10% by 2010 and 20% by 2020. Currently, the figure stands at 3.86% of the total electricity supply. Most renewable energy experts believe that Britain will miss those targets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2006/may/10/greenpolitics.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-09T23:18:28Z","webTitle":"John Vidal: Wind of change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/may/10/greenpolitics.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2006/may/10/greenpolitics.politics","fields":{"headline":"Wind of change","bodyText":"If a government department loses its secretary of state and three of its four junior ministers all in one day, it suggests one of three things: there has been an almighty failure that demands retribution; the team has been so good that it is needed elesewhere; or the changes are being made in political desperation. In the case of the Great Cull of Defra [2006], which leaves intact only Ben Bradshaw from among five ministers, at least two of the three are likely. On one level, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs needs to change fast. Margaret Beckett, the wise old Labour bird, was its first secretary of state, brought into a hurriedly created ministry near the end of the foot and mouth crisis in 2001. Having presided over the greatest cull of livestock Britain had ever seen, she is leaving just as bird flu and the greatest cull of poultry probably starts. The government's record has been dreadful. Beckett leaves behind 100,000 angry, unpaid farmers; agriculture has seemingly been downgraded to a semi-needed pastime run by a few supermarkets; much of the south-east of England is threatened with concrete; climate change emissions are rising fast and Britain is unable to meet its own targets; communities are furious about airport expansions; nuclear power is poised to make a comeback; the waste industry is in turmoil; the fishing industry is drowning; there is soaring consumption; there is more light and noise pollution than ever; and a drought will most likely kill off wildlife for a decade in some parts. On her watch, too, hunting with dogs was banned and the divide between town and country clearly widened. For a department specifically charged with protecting the environment and to encouraging sustainable development, this might seem a disaster, but it actually says less about Beckett and Defra than about the power and lack of environmental sense of other government departments. Trade and industry, planning, transport, the Treasury, even health and education, are all self-serving fiefdoms with enormous power to affect and influence the physical environment. Defra's analysis of what's been going on may be second to none; but the best it has been able to do most of the time is try to enforce European Commission directives, and make the case for the education and greening of government across the board. Clear advantages But Beckett leaves some clear advantages for the new secretary of state, David Miliband. Partly because of her department's advice to Number 10 and the Treasury, and its inputs into the energy review, the environment and sustainable development debate has risen to near the top of political agenda, and other parties are desperate to claim it as their own. Labour must now respond quickly and strongly. So if Miliband wants to take on the new transport secretary, Alistair Darling, over his department's out-of-control car and plane emissions, or to challenge Ruth Kelly over the clearly unsustainable housing plans she has inherited, or indeed tackle trade and industry chiefs over nuclear power, he may find he has more high-level support than he would expect. He will also have the sympathy of Beckett, who was continually frustrated in the post. Moreover, the polls suggest there is a new personal appetite for strong green initiatives, which Miliband should be able to harness at least in his honeymoon spell. The powerful green groups, which have a history of slavering over new environment ministers and then turning nasty, have been impressed that Miliband is one of the few ministers to pledge to reduce his own carbon emissions. But the likelihood of Defra becoming the launchpad of a new green government is slight. In place of \"Jungle\" Jim Knight, a wildlife enthusiast, and Elliot Morley, the only man in government who knows much about farming, Defra has been handed a team of metropolitan ministers who collectively have shown little enthusiasm, understanding or appreciation of the natural world. Coming in to Defra from the Department of Trade and Industry, clearly to get Defra on side with nuclear power, is Ian Pearson, the new minister of state \"for climate change and the environment\". Pearson, now responsible for the climate change review, emissions energy issues, fuel poverty, and transport and the environment, is a leading nuclear advocate, defender of free trade and the privatisation of water and electricity in developing countries. \"My personal view is that we ought to look at a limited new-build nuclear programme,\" he said. \"That strikes me as pretty much a no-brainer. It is the right thing to do.\" Meanwhile, the new minister for rural affairs, landscape and biodiversity is Barry Gardiner. Another trade and industry cast-off, he has at least shown some enthusiasm for the natural world, once arguing government should not reduce spending on the Amazon rainforest. Meanwhile, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, the fourth new member of the Defra team, replaces Lord Bach, whose disastrous handling of farm payments could still escalate and severely embarrass government. She, too, is desperately inexperienced about the environment, having spent most of her career working in childcare, health and family support. On the other hand, that could prove to be exactly the experience needed in the new Defra. Big benefits London could get a new landmark within a year if parliament accepts proposals to turn to wind and solar energy. Not only could a turbine be erected in the grounds of the palace of Westminster but many other buildings that are part of the large parliamentary estate could be fitted with solar panels and photovoltaic electricity cells. The ideas have been put to MPs by Building Design Partnership, a firm of consultants that has spent 15 months at Westminster considering how to refurbish the Westminster village. \"We are looking at all options,\" says a senior member of the parliamentary estates directorate. \"All these things are being talked about. We are keen to be green, but there are constraints. We would need planning permission, but if we could get it, [wind turbines and solar energy] are a possibility. At the moment, though, we can't move a tile on the roof without permission.\" The moves follow a damning report by former Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker, who found in 2004 that parliament was using as much energy as a small town and had increased its electricity consumption by 45%, its water consumption by 58% and its gas by 34% since 1997. Baker, delighted by the ideas, says: \"The environmental performance of parliament has been abysmal. At last some action seems to be taking place.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2006/jul/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview7","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2006-07-15T22:55:40Z","webTitle":"Et cetera: Jul 15","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2006/jul/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview7","fields":{"headline":"Renewable recomendations","bodyText":"A Short History of the Future by Colin Mason (Earthscan, £14.99) Be afraid. Numerous alarming trends threaten to culminate in what Colin Mason calls \"the 2030 spike\", a moment of crisis for humanity driven by global warming, famine and drought, war, and scary advances in biological and nanotech warfare. It may sound like dozens of sci-fi disaster movies rolled into one, but Mason, a former Australian senator, writes a narrative that is carefully researched and sober, and he actually offers some suggestions as to what to do about it: renewable energy, green communal villages connected to cities by maglev trains, a global police force, and a Billion-Artefact Programme, by which cheap computers and efficient stoves may be constructed for all. Lest you think that this now sounds like hippy utopianism, he warns that we'll either adopt such changes voluntarily or will be forced to do so, and he carefully tests each of his suggestions against an axiom of appealing to people's self-interest. There'll still have to be some sacrifices, of course: \"Replace your dinosaur with a hybrid or electric car,\" Mason advises, which will be a wrench, as I do so like riding around on my stegosaurus. Kicking the Carbon Habit by William Sweet (Columbia, £17.95) Focusing on just one of Mason's horsemen of the apocalypse, this book splits neatly into two halves. The first offers a compelling ground-up human story of how global warming came to be accepted as scientific fact, focusing on the eureka moments of geologists, climatologists and computer modellers. The second part asks what we should do about it. William Sweet (like James Lovelock) makes a case for nuclear power as one of a set of multiple strategies that can help to level off carbon-dioxide emissions, though he doesn't address Mason's point that calculations of nuclear power's cost hardly ever include the inevitable cost of eventual decommissioning. Wind energy is another favoured candidate, as in Germany and other parts of Europe. Sweet is quite sceptical about hydrogen and solar energy, although he doesn't mention new technologies such as \"solar chimneys\" described by Mason. The two do not conflict so much, though: Sweet's emphasis is more on what we can do right now using proven technology. First, burn less coal, which kills 30,000 people a year in the US through pollution, and emits twice as much CO2 as oil. Was Margaret Thatcher an environmental hero after all? Candy Freak by Steve Almond (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, £10.99) The Proustian effect of one's favourite childhood chocolate bars is indisputable, though the effect of Steve Almond's book may be rather spoiled for a British audience since most of the American \"candy\" he references is unknown to us. Nevertheless, he gets impressive mileage out of the idea of writing a humorous book about his love of chocolate and other sweets. The fact that the big corporate confectioners won't let him into their factories (for fear of giving away trade secrets) is turned into a virtue, as instead he tours smaller, independent concerns, run by happily plump, avuncular chocolate-lovers, and tastes their products in a kind of permanent erotic daze. Almond's aesthetic fascination with \"enrobers\" and other bits of machinery becomes a bit repetitive, but that is probably a subtle joke on the love of chocolate being about the comfort of repetition. Unfortunately, he also seeks to contextualise his subject in a couple of self-pitying autobiographical sections labelled \"Depressing but Necessary Digressions\", which are certainly depressing, but not necessary. Perhaps he feared that merely talking about chocolate would not constitute sufficiently serious or artistic writing, but sticking to the subject brings out the best of his considerable comic and poetic ability.

Naked. Vapour steams from our shoulders and thighs while my head appears to have floated free of my neck. There are, Eero tells me, wolves in this forest as well as elks, the odd lynx and even a bear or two. Although it's eight in the evening, the day is still bright and birds are singing in the slender birches and towering pines around us. This is the third time in two hours we've emerged from the smoke sauna, bringing with us the scent of burning alder logs, and sunk our heated, sweating bodies into the treacle-coloured river. The contrast in temperature, from the 90C air that folds about you with each ladle's splash and hiss over the hot stones, to the 7C river water, is alarming. Your heart races, your breath catches and your blood comes humming to the surface of your skin. As you sit out the wake of this sensory assault, however, you begin to realise why so many Finns subject themselves to this process. It's calming and invigorating all at once, or as Eero puts it, \"a chance to sit and listen to yourself, your body\". It's said that Finland has enough lakes and islands for every Finnish family to own one. I don't know if this is true, but as you fly north over the Great Lakes of Saimaa and Paijanne towards Kuopio airport, it's certainly believable. The land below is a lattice-work of water and forest, with isolated islets, narrow peninsulas and curving beaches all linked by waterways of river and canal. As we drive further north again towards our final destination the lake per family anecdote seems even more believable. I'd read there are just 16 Finns to every 16 sq km of Finland, but it isn't until you're actually in the landscape that you really appreciate how gifted the country is with space. If it's escape from the summer hordes you're looking for, then this is the place to come, as the original tsarist Russian tourists did in the 19th century and as thousands of city-living Finns do today every summer weekend. Which is why, in pursuit of the ultimate take-off-the-watch getaway, we're heading for an escape from the escape ... Heron's Lodge is a traditionally built mokki (summer cottage) complete with its own wood-burning sauna on the shores of lake Salahminjarvi. The coloured rectangles over Finland that mark out the maps in my guidebook form a neat triangle around this lake and the surrounding area, making it in my book (literally speaking at least) satisfyingly off the map. When we arrive, it's actually only been six and half hours since we left London and less than 10 minutes since we left the main road. The situation of Heron's Lodge, however, tucked away within the ruler-straight pines overlooking an undisturbed portion of lake, crystallises this off-the-map feel. I can't help feeling we should have travelled longer and further to have achieved such a sense of isolation. It's in these lakes, rather than beside them, however, that the Finnish landscape really makes sense. On the drive north we'd been left somewhat uninspired by the regimented forests and cultivated fields dotted with red-painted barns. But this all changes the next morning when Leo and Kaija Ruotsalainen, the owners of Heron Lodge, take us canoeing on lake Kiurujarvi. From water level, the landscape appears both more varied and complex. The deep greens of the conifers and fields are off set by platinum blonde reeds and the peeling barks of silver birches. We also become more aware of the fauna; along the banks, beaver-bitten stumps like shortened pencils punctuate the flowers, while lapwings flap heavily beneath the smoother glide of brown swamp hawks. The canoeing itself, in double Canadian kayaks, is hard work against a strong head wind then, on entering the river, suddenly easy and peaceful. Less easy or peaceful is what's on offer at the end of our journey where what Leo describes as a \"Finnish natural spa\" awaits us. For spa, read white-water arcs gushing through crevices in the weir wall with chained metal triangles to hold on to. The idea is to hang from these triangles and let the icy compressed water pound your back. Apparently it's good for you. From the moment we arrived Leo and Kaija have fed us heartily with traditional Finnish cuisine: lake-caught whitefish in cream sauce, grilled pork and mushrooms, local cheeses and some tasty things called 'poor knights', a Finnish take on French toast, upgraded with a dose of cinnamon. The meal after our canoeing trip is no exception. Back at Sininen Helmi, their bird-egg-blue lakeside 19th century house, Leo serves up pancakes with cloudberry compote, followed by a dash of cognac to take away that 'spa' chill. Like everywhere in the area, Sininen Helmi has its own wood-burning sauna, but by now I'd started to realise that in Finland the sauna is not just always close geographically, but also philosophically and socially too. Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising as the smells and sensations of the sauna are somehow hard-wired into the Finnish psyche; after all, as Leo and Kaija explain, the smoke-sauna was traditionally where children were born, where families gathered and where village gossip was swapped. Even nowadays, Sininen Helmi regularly plays host to day-long business conferences where meetings are held naked in the the steam of the sauna. The idea of a nude board meeting would seem strange elsewhere, but in Finland it somehow seems fitting, a worthy image for the contrasting juxtapositions that make up the Finnish character. For while the Finns we meet are all courteous, practical, reserved yet welcoming people, it seems there is also, within all Finns, an undeniable propensity for wackiness. Think Eurovision winners Lordi, or perhaps the most famous Finnish export, the Moomins. In the Lakeland area this eccentricity often comes to the fore over the brief summer festival period, and no more so than at the wife-carrying festival held in nearby Sonkajarvella every July. Inspired by an infamous local thief who initiated his gang members by making them steal someone else's wife, what began as a bit of a joke has now become serious sport. At least, as serious as is possible when the main event involves running round an obstacle course with a wife (not necessarily your own) clinging to your back. Again, it all seems perfectly Finnish; the physical prowess, the sense of history, the bizarreness. In recent years, however, it's all become a bit more, well, Estonian - the winners of the festival are increasingly from Finland's neighbour. As Leo says, \"The Estonians - they have very big men and very small women.\" A winning combination, obviously. We are too early for the wife-carrying festival, and our own experience of Finnish eccentricity is confined to dining at Kuappi, the world's smallest restaurant, in Iisalmi, a town almost exactly half way between Helsinki and the Arctic Circle. Situated in the town's harbour opposite the local Olvi brewery, the restaurant boasts room for just two diners. When it gets crowded, and if the weather is fine, there's another table outside for two more. The food was excellent, but as to there being a reason for this restaurant, there didn't seem to be one. \"Someone thought it was a good idea,\" is the closest I get to an answer. I wasn't convinced, until the next day when I realised the intimacy and sheer oddness of eating in a slightly leaky shed made everything about the meal memorable in a way it just wouldn't have been in a restaurant for, well, more than two. Black Tomato, the UK travel agents for Heron Lodge, also offers travellers a book and a CD of their choice to take on their journey. Thinking I should get into the Finnish swing of things, I opted for the Kalevala, the 19th-century epic poem compiled from traditional Finnish oral poetry by Elias Lonnrot that did so much to bolster early Finnish nationalism on the road to independence. Although much of the Kalevala is set further east across the Finnish/Russian border, it's the landscape of the poem, its forested ridges, dark rivers and secluded lakes that dominate our hike the next day. Guided by local hunter Urpo Piippo, we strike deep into the woods. Urpo speaks no English and our Finnish hasn't progressed past kiitos (thank you) and kippis (cheers), but the lack of a common language makes our walk all the more enjoyable. Everything is conveyed by gesture, sound and mime. The effect is one of bringing you that bit closer again to the nature around you, abandoning verbal language for a more elemental shared physical experience. On returning to Heron's Lodge that evening, we fire up the cabin's lakeside wood-burning sauna which we finally enter in the sunset of a Finnish midnight. We've only been here for two days but already the sense of escape is complete. Bathing in the lake between bouts in the sauna, it's as if the silence of this location, of the taut, unrippled lake and the dark forest around us, has somehow stretched time to make hours feel like days and our days like a week. As we watch the lake's surface cool from red, to orange to pink, all thoughts of our departure in the morning dissipate with the fading light. It's as if the landscape is speaking to us, directly from the poetry it once inspired, the Kalevala; Farewell now upon your way, Upon your journey sweetly, End your curve beautifully, Come at evening into joy! Way to go Getting there Heron's Lodge costs from £799pp for seven nights' self-catering, based on four sharing, including international and domestic flights plus car hire from Kuopio with Black Tomato (020-7610 9008, blacktomato.co.uk).

Five other cabins to escape to Brimnes Cabins, Ólafsfjördur, Iceland Famous for its isolated ruggedness and expansive vowel usage, the northern tip of Iceland is prime cabin country. The Hotel Brimes has eight little wooden numbers on the banks of the roll-off-the-tongue lake Ólafsfjardarvatn. Boredom is unlikely - one can sail, fish, canoe and ride horses. brimnes.is, from £96 per night. Great Glen Chalets, Fort William Not log cabins as such, but certainly related somewhere down the family tree (family tree, geddit?), these eight Scandinavian-style timber chalets reside within the woodlands of an organic farm in the foothills of Ben Nevis, three miles from Fort William. fortwilliam-chalets.co.uk, from £345 per week. Finca La Píedra, Andalucía, Spain Who said log cabins had to be nippy alpine affairs? Mike and Jane (expats, one assumes) have two cabañas in the Finca la Píedra olive grove with spectacular views over the Sierra de Aguas and Los Gaitanes natural park. The cabins are air-conditioned, use hot water supplied by solar energy, and have French windows opening on to balconies for al fresco mountain ogling. fincalapiedra.com, from €400 per week (two sharing) B&amp;B. The High Cabin, Snowdonia OK, this one is a bit of a splurge, but just wait until you hear what it packs. The cabin sits on a mountain ridge above the Conwy valley, with a king-sized bed, luxurious bathroom, black leather sofas, big fancy telly with DVD player, a fully equipped kitchen and a heated veranda. Oh, did I mention the outdoor hot-tub with mountain views? groesinn.co.uk/high-cabin.htm, from £195 per night, two nights minimum. Merekalda Cabins, Käsmu, Estonia Estonia is a bit like Finland, only smaller and more Baltic. The cabins lie on the coast of the small village of Käsmu, which juts out into the Baltic on the northern fringe of the Lahemaa national park.

We know from the start that something bad has happened and we can guess what it is, but the writing avoids all clichés . Don't expect to be cheered up, but it did make me look around and decide that my lot are not that bad. Geoffrey Bamford Holmfirth, West Yorkshire Alexander McCall Smith's 44 Scotland Street (Abacus) and its sequels, Espresso Tales and Love Over Scotland, bring delight in their celebration of everyday life in an Edinburgh suburb. They are minor classics in the tradition of Mr Pooter's diary. My book from the past is John Steinbeck's The Pearl (Penguin Modern Classics). As a teacher I must have read it at least 20 times, and the gentle but inevitable drive towards tragedy, together with the tranquillity of the language in which it is expressed, never fails to give me a deep sense of joy and pain . Sam Banik London Clive James's Cultural Amnesia (Picador) is an excellent anthology of essays on the lives and works of many luminaries who have shaped our social, political and cultural consciousness over a hundred years. In A Writer's People (Picador), the Nobel laureate VS Naipaul reminisces about the literati, here and abroad, about his younger days in Trinidad and the \"ways of looking and feeling\" in a mutating world. As always, Naipaul is a joy to read, although his remark about India having no autonomous intellectual life will off end many people. Brenda Beamond Lymington, Hampshire Only 70 pages long, Kressman Taylor's Address Unknown (Souvenir Press) will stay in the memory for ever. Two Germans, one in California and the other in Nazi Germany, correspond in a poignant and austere refl ection of strained loyalties in the 1930s. It was fi rst published in 1939. My local library had a waiting list of 14 after it was reviewed on Radio 4's A Good Read. This slight book might seem costly to buy, but regard yourself as a lending library and pass it round to all you know. Charles Boardman Nottingham In writing Redemption Falls (Harvill Secker), an extraordinary story of human remnants - good, bad, hopeless - of the American civil war, Joseph O'Connor interweaves straight narrative, journals, press reports and letters to telling effect. These strands gradually come together in a devastating climax, with a crucial fact revealed only in the final sentence. Dinaw Mengestu's Children of the Revolution (Jonathan Cape) concerns the not always successful efforts of a lonely Ethiopian immigrant in the US to widen his circle of friends and to save his failing business. A gentle and beautifully written novel that never raises its voice. I felt better for having read it. Jerard Bretts Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire Sean O'Brien's The Drowned Book (Picador) is a beautiful collection of poems to which I've kept coming back over the year. It is steeped in recent British history and the landscapes of the north, and his anti-Thatcher \"Valedictory\" is alone worth the price : \"Let ignorance be iron-willed: / The task is always to rebuild / Our city.\" Hand Me My Travelin' Shoes by Michael Gray (Bloomsbury) transported me to the pre-civil rights American south in a meticulous and ground-breaking biography of the blues musician Blind Willie McTell, the subject of one of Bob Dylan's most haunting songs . Finally, I caught up with John Updike's 2006 novel Terrorist (Penguin) and found it to be a terrifi c read. Updike captures the mood of the times perfectly in his thought-provoking portrait of a teenage would-be suicide bomber in a New Jersey city. As ever, Updike's prose is exquisite, alive to the nuances of life after 9/11, and the plot is utterly gripping. Sue Brooks Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire This year I discovered Roger Deakin. There are two books - Waterlog (Vintage), published in 1999, and Wildwood (Hamish Hamilton), published posthumously this year. I was saddened to hear of his death. Reading Waterlog was such an exhil arating experience, I wanted to write and thank him. The book is a long exploration of the swimming places of these islands: open-air lidos, quarries, waterfalls, rivers, streams, underground pools . The enthusiasm is infectious. I'm not a great swimmer, but as a tribute, I visited the nearest open-air lido, never having done such a thing before, and it was marvellous. Barbara Brown Bisley, Gloucestershire The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters ( Fourth Estate), edited by Diana Mitford's daughter-in-law, Charlotte Mosley, brings spice and immediacy to the endlessly fascinating story of Nancy, Pamela, Diana, Unity, Jessica and Deborah Mitford between the years 1925 and 2002, not least in their almost libellous gossip and extreme opinions . Hermione Lee's massive Edith Wharton (Chatto &amp; Windus) explores the complex life of this extraordinary woman: a brilliant author and colossal snob who toured Europe and the States always with some man-about-town or literary lion in tow, then startled her contemporaries by flinging herself into war work in Paris during the first world war. But in the end, my vote must go to Claire Tomalin's Thomas Hardy: The Time-Torn Man (Penguin), which so compellingly achieves its objective: to help us to understand the secret sorrows of the rural fiddler's son who danced before he could write . Michael Callanan Birmingham Tom McCarthy's icy and circular writing in his debut novel Remainder (Alma Books) has echoes of Paul Auster. Auster himself produced a welcome , if short, luxury, Travels in the Scriptorium (Faber). With Ascent (Jonathan Cape), Jed Mercurio created a protagonist so heroic and yet so detached from humanity that it's a credit to his talent that he made me care so much. However, the best novel out this year, for me, has to be Biyi Bandele's Burma Boy (Jonathan Cape). Working from stories told him by his father, Bandele has written an engaging, lucid, humo rous and humane novel about the horrors of war. James Choles Hangzhou, China My book of the year is Don DeLillo's Falling Man (Picador). It is a tremendous return to form, certainly his best since Underworld. I love how the events of 9/11 seep into the lives of the main characters : the kids who scour the skies through their binoculars looking for \"Bill Lawton\" ; the group of Alzheimer's patients who only want to write about the planes; the Giorgio Morandi still life that becomes a picture of the towers. This is how a tragedy is felt, in these complex and fleeting moments to which the novelist must give form. Simon Clarke London Patricia Ferguson's Peripheral Vision (Solidus) interweaves three tales of love, passion and suff ering with consummate skill. I enjoyed Charlotte Greig's fi rst novel, A Girl's Guide to Modern European Philosophy (Serpent's Tail), a witty and inventive tale of a female student in the early 1970s dealing with life's setbacks , with a little help from Nietzsche, Heidegger and Kierkegaard. The most memorable books in translation were Alaa Al Aswany's The Yacoubian Building (Harper Perennial, translated by Humphrey Davies), which reveals the richness of Cairo through the lives of some residents of an apartment block, and Morten Ramsland's Doghead (Doubleday, translated by Tiina Nunnally), a delightful, John Irving- like Danish family saga. Brenda Cox Swansea Set in France during the second world war, Irène Némirovsky's Suite Française (Vintage), translated from the French by Sandra Smith, is a timeless novel about the human condition , made all the more moving because of the circumstances surrounding its discovery - by the author's daughter more than 60 years after her mother's death in Auschwitz. Angus Doulton Bletchingdon, Oxfordshire Jon Latimer's Burma : The Forgotten War (John Murray) off ers a magnifi - cently comprehensive assessment of that vicious campaign. Was it the fi rst combined British -American shot at crashing around in the jungle for uncertain ends, or was it a great feat of arms and endurance? Or both at once? Gillian Dunstan Cullompton, Devon Jim Lynch's fi rst novel, The Highest Tide (Bloomsbury), is to be savoured as a rare treat. During one seemingly endless summer, 13-year-old Miles O'Malley comes to recognise that his safe, familiar childhood is vanishing for ever. He fi nds consolation in his passion for ecology and his fantasies about the enigmatic Angie, his onetime babysitter and wannabe rock chick. Alternately funny and tragic, it is a delicious, thought-provoking read . Brian Fearon Fakenham, Norfolk CK Stead's My Name Was Judas (Vintage) is the story of the life (and death) of Jesus as told by his childhood friend, and later disciple, Judas. Judas did not commit suicide after all, but changed his name and went to live in Greece. Urbane and elegant, with a sharp sense of the ridiculous, Judas gently debunks the Christian myth. Niall Griffi ths's Runt (Jonathan Cape) gives us the world as seen through the eyes of a disturbed but gifted 16-year-old boy who is sent to live with his alcoholic and recently bereaved uncle on a remote Welsh farm. The violent climax is memorable, but more so is the touching relationship be- tween the boy and his dog. Davide Ferrauto London First The Uncommon Reader (Profi le/ Faber), Alan Bennett's eulogy to books and reading. Funny, touching, insightful and extraordinarily eff ective in bringing characters to life in half a (small) page. A lesson in prose economy. And surprisingly gentle to our old Queen, too. Ian McEwan gave us a powerful tale of cramped emotions and gender politics in the 100 or so pages of On Chesil Beach (Jonathan Cape). Janet Davey's The Taxi Queue (Chatto &amp; Windus) was also effective in creating characters, giving us only signifi cant personality traits and leaving us to fill in the blanks. A touching story of loneliness, sexual confusion and family ties. William Firebrace London Le Labyrinthe Infernal, the ninth volume of Jacques Tardi's series of graphic novels, has just been published by Casterman after a wait of nine years since volume eight. The narrative is extreme and complex , the artwork is beautiful and elegant, with amazing coloured images of 20 s Paris. Volume 10, Le Bébé des Buttes-Chaumont, is expected . . . sometime. Waldo Gemio London For sheer enjoyment, Michael Chabon's The Yiddish Policemen's Union (Fourth Estate) and Howard Jacobson's Kalooki Nights (Vintage) both take darkly humorous looks at being Jewish. Crime lovers will already be aware of two serial criminals: the ageless Parker (the inspiration for \"Walker\" in John Boorman's Point Blank) returns in Richard Stark's Ask the Parrot (Quercus); and Lawrence Block's likeable assassinfor- hire, Keller, is back for the third time in Hit Parade (Orion). Finally, at 49 pages, you might argue that Joseph Roth's last work, The Legend of the Holy Drinker (Granta, translat ed by Michael Hofmann), isn't a novel; only it is, and it's perfect. Richard Gilyead Cirencester, Gloucestershire One of my best reads about four years ago was Richard Powers's The Time of Our Singing (Vintage). In his new novel, The Echo Maker (William Heinemann), a young man suffers a traumatic brain injury in a road accident and thinks his older sister is an impostor. She calls on an expert neurologist to help and all three find their identities in question. T C Boyle's Talk Talk (Bloomsbury) provided an entertaining, if scary, description of the effects on an innocent deaf teacher, and her boyfriend, as a criminal uses her identity to continue his lavish lifestyle. A chance remark by a confused elderly relative in Jon McGregor's tender So Many Ways to Begin (Bloomsbury) makes a dull museum curator question his whole life story as he struggles to find out who he really is. Robert Greenwood Chatham, Kent This year came the deaths of jazz trumpeter Mick Mulligan and his sometime vocalist George Melly, whose aff ecting memoir of his old friend and former boss appeared in this newspaper in January. Owning Up (Penguin), Melly's account of his years with Mulligan, fi rst published in 1965 and still in print, is one of my favourite books, but anyone who has read it should also read Jim Godbolt's autobiographical All This and Many a Dog (Northway Publications), now back in print. Godbolt represented Melly and Mulligan as their agent throughout the 1950s, and his book includes detailed and frank, if aff ectionate, portraits of this hard-drinking and rakish duo. The testimony of a resilient and cultured man, it is full of humour and compassion . Libby Grimshaw Nottingham My discovery of the year was Christopher Hope's White Boy Running (Picador), a title I found written on a napkin at the bottom of my handbag. I still do n't know who recommended this memoir of growing up around the corner from Dr Verwoerd in 1960 s Johannesburg. Mark Haddon in A Spot of Bother (Vintage) disturbed and amused as he took us through mental collapse and matrimonial adventure, as did David Mitchell with Black Swan Green (Sceptre), a gentle but sinister coming-of-age novel quite unlike his previous work. Lauren Hadden Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin Rudolph Delson's debut Maynard &amp; Jennica (Fourth Estate) got great reviews in the US, but has had a quieter landing over here. This is a shame, as it's one of the most charming, funny love stories I've read in a long time. It's the tale of two slightly lost oddbods and could only be set in New York. Told in a seductive between-you-and-me style by 35 different narrators (a lot less irritating than it sounds), this is a hymn not only to unlikely relationships everywhere, but to New York itself . Shelley Harris Marlow, Buckinghamshire Jane Harris's The Observations (Faber) is a treat. The novel is set in the 1860s and narrated by Bessy Buckley, sometime gentleman's companion, who hastily reconstructs herself as a lady's maid in the fi rst chapter. Her voice - sharp, sassy, very funny - is what makes the book such an engrossing read. Sandra Hawes Eastbourne, East Sussex Kiran Desai's The Inheritance of Loss (Penguin) is a delight. Desai's talent lies in her knowledge of northern India's politics and social history in the 1980s. Her narrative of illegal immigrants unable to find work in America and exploited by unscrupulous employers is powerful. The love affair between Sai and Gyan, a man with divided loyalties in a world of contrasting interests, is heart-rending. A great read, opening the west's eyes to eastern cultural differences. Martin Hills Chichester, West Sussex Denis Johnson's Tree of Smoke (Picador) centres around American psychological intelligence operations during the Vietnam war. Darkly comic and beautifully written, it combines vivid physicality with a hallucinatory quality to convey cultural dislocation and forces way out of control. John Gray's Black Mass (Allen Lane) analyses how apocalyptic religion has become historically intertwined with utopianism . Blair is not economical with the truth, but lacks a normal understanding of it . Gray's timely argument for political realism off ers a welcome cautionary message. Carrie Horgan Norwich I found the freshest, most original voice in fi ction this year to be Miranda July's in her collection of short stories No One Belongs Here More Than You (Canongate). A lonely woman living in the middle of nowhere gives swimming lessons in her living room; a non-communicative couple realise their relationship is over while acting as extras in a restaurant scene . . . The stories are laugh-out-loud funny and poignant at the same time. Martin Jones Eastbourne, East Sussex I picked up Travis Holland's The Archivist's Story (Bloomsbury), set in Stalin's Russia on the eve of the second world war, from a first novels pile in Eastbourne Library. The title's archivist, Pavel, has been removed from his job as a teacher of literature. He treads a risky path between his job, archiving banned literature for the KGB, and his commitment to free expression. The quiet fears, sadnesses and hardships of ordinary individuals, lost in the madness of totalitarianism, are beautifully described in a gripping read. Melanie Jones Brierley Hill, West Midlands Scarlett Thomas's The End of Mr Y (Canongate) may not be the bestwritten novel of 2007, but I found this smart and stylish story of Ariel Manto's adventure with a rare and dangerous book wholly absorbing. I also loved Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach (Jonathan Cape). This slight volume, which narrates the events of one night in June 1962, left me moved. It deserved to win the Booker far more than that dreary novel by Anne Enright. Vidyaratha Kissoon Georgetown, Guyana Shantaram (Abacus) by Gregory David Roberts is a piece of wonderful storytelling - all 935 pages of it - with interesting characterisation, compassionate humour and descriptions of parts of India that are usually seen only through the eyes of the media. Kate Latham Gunnislake, Cornwall In Richard Ford's The Lay of the Land (Bloomsbury) everything and nothing happens in the run-up to Thanksgiving - a funeral, an explosion in a hospital and the onset of prostate cancer. Against this background, old friendships, past and current relationships and being a parent of \"grown up\" children are explored with a brutal but illuminating honesty. This is a book about a world that does not play fair. Colette Lawlor Silverdale, North Lancashire I waited in anticipation for Maggie O'Farrell's new book, and The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox (Headline) delivered a poignant story about a forgotten aunt that relates to more of us than we might realise. Rachel Cusk's Arlington Park (Faber) will have given many noughties mothers a jolt of recognition. Perceptive and funny, with a great SUV moment! And I really enjoyed the work of the Barrow poet Jennifer Copley. In Unsafe Monuments (Arrowhead Press), her words take us with them in amazing leaps and bounds, yet remain grounded in the everyday . Maria McCarthy Rochester, Kent My favourite reads of 2007 have an Irish fl avour. My non-fi ction choice is Thomas Lynch's Booking Passage: We Irish &amp; Americans (Vintage). Part memoir, part political, historical and religious commentary, part guide for writers , Lynch's book is full of good sense and is written in a readable yet literary style. \"Night of the Quicken Trees\" from Claire Keegan's Walk the Blue Fields (Faber) is a memorable folk tale set in modern rural Ireland, whil e Bernard MacLaverty's stories in Matters of Life and Death (Vintage) have a grittier, edgier feel. Austin McHale Isleworth, Middlesex My book of the year is Cormac Mc- Carthy's The Road (Picador). I read it over two days rather than my usual two weeks, having been transported into another universe - cruel, bleak and yet suff used with the memory of love. I would also like to give an honourable mention to Redemption Falls (Harvill), by Joseph O'Connor, a dizzying sweep through 19th -century Ireland, Australia and America in the company of a host of narrators, some more reliable than others. Fred McKinley Bury, Lancashire As an 82 year old, I have fallen out with modern fiction, preferring popular science books. I bought Jay Griffi ths's Pip Pip: A Sideways Look at Time (Flamingo) thinking it was of this genre. It was, but to say Pip Pip is just another science book is to say Tristam Shandy is just another novel. Pip Pip is an explosion of fun, facts, legends, rage, sex, humour and vulgarity, beautifully written and deeply researched. It smashed my views on history, religion, femininity, art and time, which, it turns out, is not only relative but cyclical. It is the most exciting book I have read in years. Hamilton McMillan London Andrew Hodges's One to Nine (Short Books), about the fi rst nine numbers, is well worth a grapple. Contemporary German fi ction doesn't generally do too well here, but I recommend Franz Schätzing's The Swarm (Hodder) , a gripping eco-thriller. Sally-Anne Spencer's fi rstrate translation has just won this year's Schlegel-Tieck prize. Ian Mankin London I think art books rarely make a good read, but each image in Glitter and Doom: German Portraits from the 1920s (Yale University Press) had a really interesting story to tell, not only about the sitter, but about the times, too. I read it from cover to cover. Janet Malcolm is a wonderfull stylish writer . Her choice of subjects sometimes appears at fi rst to be dry, but Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice (Stein and Toklas), also published by Yale University Press, was an interesting read about those earlier times. The Rug Merchant (Penguin) by Meg Mullins is a very moving love story of an Iranian living and working in New York It gave me a much better understanding of what it's like to be Middle Eastern, and that for some it's not always so great to live in this wonderful western world of ours. Tristan Martin Newmarket, Suffolk Oil: it's non-renewable, and peak production might be only a few short years away. Paul Roberts's comprehensive study of the subject, The End of Oil (Bloomsbury), is not simply an apocalyptic, doom-mongering treatise. But n either does the future seem rosy, with substitutes such as biofuels, solar energy, hydrogen fuel cells, carbon sequestration and nuclear (among others) incapable of fully taking oil's place, at least not without hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in new energy infrastructure. Andrew Moorhouse Rochdale, Lancashire James Schiff 's Updike in Cincinnati (Ohio University Press) is essentially a record of John Updike's visit to Cincinnati, where he was a guest speaker at a writers' conference. Throughout it all, Updike comes across as wise, funny, urbane and understanding of his and our failings. Hayden Murphy Edinburgh Michael Henry Heim's English translation of Günter Grass's autobiography, Peeling the Onion (Harvill Secker), reveals how vulnerable fact is to the vanity of fiction: \"When gaping blanks came up I doodled flourishes and stick figures.\" As an Edinburgh-based Dubliner, I enjoyed Ian Rankin's Exit Music (Orion). After 14 books, Rebus finally stops pacing the streets of the capital in pursuit of clues and criminals. Now, in Bloomsday fashion, I can pursue his pub crawls without fear of him glaring at me in the Oxford Bar. As for poetry, Edwin Morgan's A Book of Lives (Carcanet) : \"Kiss me with rain on your eyelashes, / come on, let us sway together, / under the trees, and to hell with thunder.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2006/may/21/energy.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-21T00:43:58Z","webTitle":"Comment: Should Britain recommit to nuclear power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/may/21/energy.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/may/21/energy.comment","fields":{"headline":"Should Britain recommit to nuclear power?","bodyText":"Karol Sikora The nuclear business is beset with bad press. From its wide association with death and destruction in Japan in the Second World War, the disaster of Chernobyl and the bad vibes around radiotherapy in cancer treatment, it badly needs a PR makeover. But it's actually the cleanest form of energy. No mess, no smoke, no smell, no devastation of the countryside to mine fossil fuels. Coal, gas and oil will inevitably run out eventually - they're not sustainable. We are going to have to return to atomic energy. New technology has made nuclear power safer and cheaper. But it needs to be rebranded urgently, just like those organic carrots on sale at farmer's markets at twice the price of their smarter-looking supermarket brothers. Nuclear power is a natural product, after all. · Karol Sikora is a cancer specialist Stephen Tindale Blair's announcement is dreadful news. Waste remains dangerous for thousands of years and there's no safe way of managing it. Nuclear power is inextricably linked to nuclear weapons - as we're seeing in Iran - so promoting it as a response to climate change encourages proliferation. It's ruinously expensive: the bill to clean up past misadventures is £70bn. And it's unnecessary. By decentralising the energy system and using the waste heat from power stations to warm homes and offices we could burn fossil fuels more efficiently, cutting our dependence on imports and slashing carbon emissions. Going nuclear, in contrast, will choke off investment in renewables and leave us dependent on a failed 1950s technology. · Stephen Tindale is Executive Director, Greenpeace UK Sarfraz Manzoor I am a reluctant advocate of nuclear power. As a country, we cannot continue to rely on fossil fuels which are environmentally harmful, subject to geopolitical volatility and finite. I strongly believe that we should be investing more in renewable forms of energy, but it seems unlikely that wind or solar energy will be able to replace oil and gas. While there are obvious risks with nuclear energy, it is also the nearest thing to a non-polluting energy source; a nuclear reactor emits virtually no carbon dioxide and modern reactors are now safer. With oil and gas prices rising, the supply of cheap gas running low, along with the challenge of reducing carbon emissions, it seems that signing up to nuclear energy is a bullet that we are going to have to bite. · Sarfraz Manzoor is a writer and broadcaster Sunder Katwala I don't see nuclear power as an ideological issue, but a technical question: what energy mix will deliver sufficient supply and get us back on track for our climate-change targets? Nuclear, renewable sources and reducing demand all have their champions, but no single option will be 'the answer'. Without new nuclear power stations, we will lose a carbon-free chunk of energy, but waste disposal is a big question mark. It comes down to economics: what public support is needed and could those resources deliver better energy and climate results elsewhere? Nuclear may need to remain part of the picture, but should be combined with accelerating investment to help renewables become more economically viable long-term. · Sunder Katwala is general secretary of the Fabian Society"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2006/sep/24/spaceexploration.theobserver","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-23T23:37:13Z","webTitle":"Cooling Sun brings relief  to sweltering  Earth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/24/spaceexploration.theobserver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/sep/24/spaceexploration.theobserver","fields":{"headline":"Cooling Sun brings relief  to sweltering  Earth","bodyText":"The earth could be rescued from global warming by an unlikely saviour: not fewer cars, nor less pollution, nor even thousands of wind farms spread across Britain's hillsides - but, remarkably, by a cooler Sun. An international group of scientists believes a period of reduced solar activity could soon bring desperately needed cooling to our sweltering world. The work is based on research of past periods of climatic change, including the Little Ice Age in the 1700s when Europe shivered, the Thames froze over, and harvests failed. At the same time, solar activity dropped and sunspots disappeared from the face of the Sun. Now leading scientists are predicting that we may soon enter such a period again - although they stress such cooling would only bring temporary relief to our overheated world. In the end, the Earth will still be swamped by huge rises in global temperatures, triggered by human activities, that will affect the planet over the next few decades. 'If there was a period of low solar activity, it could give us a little more time to combat global warming and to introduce the curbs on the carbon emissions that we need to limit climate change,' said Professor Joanna Haigh, of Imperial College, London. The revelation comes in the wake of Nasa's successful launch on Friday of the Solar-B mission, which will study the Sun's corona. Space scientists are finalising preparations for two other probes to study the star that dominates the world: Stereo, in which one spaceship will fly ahead of, and another behind, the Earth as it orbits the Sun; and Solar Orbiter, which will swoop close to the Sun's surface to gain a detailed view of its surface. Scientists have known for decades that the Sun's output varies over an 11-year cycle. More recently, they have found what appear to be other, longer cycles affecting its output. These occasionally cause perceptible drops in solar radiation. For example, during the Little Ice Age, which affected Europe from 1650 to the end of the 18th century, astronomers noted that sunspots disappeared completely from the face of the Sun. 'High numbers of sunspots are associated with increased solar output,' said Professor Sami Solanki, of the Max Planck Institute for Solar Research, in Katlenberg-Lindau, Germany. 'Sunspots occur when magnetic fields rip through the Sun's surface and show that vast amounts of energy are being released deep within its heart. The impact on the Earth can be considerable.' Studies have shown that when solar output is high, the climate tends to be hot. For example, over the past 30 to 40 years scientists believe the Sun has been particularly active, adding to Earth's already considerable heating problems. However, things may change in the near future. One study, by a group led by solar expert Leif Svalgaard of ETK - a consulting firm based in Houston, Texas - has predicted that in the next few years solar activity is set to drop to its weakest level in over a century, with sunspot numbers declining by about 40 per cent over the next decade. 'Sunspot numbers will be extremely small,' he said. This point was backed by Cambridge solar physicist Nigel Weiss. 'Periods of high solar activity do not last long, perhaps 50 to 100 years, then you get a crash,' he told New Scientist. 'It is a boom-bust system and I would expect a crash soon.' The net result of this sunspot decrease could be to lead to an increase in cloud formation and also to a reduction in ultra-violet radiation reaching the atmosphere. Overall, it would bring about a 0.2C decline in global temperatures, according to Solanki and his colleagues. That is only a tenth of the rise now predicted to grip the world over the next few decades, however. Not enough to save the Earth from a sweltering, overheated fate but possibly enough to provide a little breathing space in which humanity could take remedial action. 'Just who might benefit most from any reduction in solar energy is hard to say at present,' added Professor Haigh. 'The Little Ice Age was mainly felt in western Europe and the rest of the world was relatively unaffected - possibly because meteorological effects cause solar radiation reductions to have localised impacts. That could happen again, though it is difficult to predict where.' However, not every expert on solar radiation agrees with the idea that sunspot numbers are set to decline. Other scientists - using the same data - have come to a different conclusion. They predict that numbers will increase over the next decade. 'We predict a 30 to 50 per cent increase,' said Mausumi Dikpati, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research's High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado. If such an increase occurs, there could then be a strengthening of global temperature rises. It is an interesting issue, admits Svalgaard, one of the main backers of the low-sunspot school. 'If all models predict the same thing, we don't get wiser.' As to finding out who is right, that would take a couple of years, he added. 'We're all waiting.' Great ball of fire The Sun is a sphere of super-hot gas, 870,000 miles in diameter. Its volume is great enough to hold more than one million Earths. The surface temperature is 5,500 degrees Centigrade: it is 15 million degrees C at its core. The average distance from Earth to Sun is 93 million miles. At a steady 70mph, it would take 152 years to drive there. Even with a speed of 186,000 miles per second, it takes light eight-and-a-half minutes to travel from the Sun's surface to the Earth. At 4.5 billion years old, the Sun is halfway through its lifespan. George Harrison's Here Comes the Sun was written in Eric Clapton's garden in 1969.

The ministers are making developers revamp plans for a 10,000-home town five miles north-west of Cambridge to achieve 50% reductions in energy consumption and mains water use compared with conventional housing. They will also today announce a study into how 120,000 homes, to be built along the Thames Gateway to the east of London, can set the trend in coping with climate change. The long-term ambition is for the entire gateway to be carbon neutral in its impact even if some homes and businesses fall short. That will mean helping to cut travel, providing local employment instead of acting as satellites for the capital, and possibly being a green technology hub from which Britain can export ideas. Ministers hope to harness ideas for more \"utopian\" urban communities - exemplified, for instance, by Dontang, an eco-city of 500,000 people planned for a Shanghai suburb - and boost demand for photovoltaic cells, solar panels and domestic wind turbines so that the costs of such renewable energy equipment start to plummet. The developments should, they believe, also help high-volume housebuilders to raise standards, first through voluntary codes but later by regulation, and make green technology affordable for everyone. The plans will be outlined by Yvette Cooper, Ruth Kelly's deputy at the new Department for Communities and Local Government, when she addresses the Green Alliance thinktank with the environment secretary, David Miliband. They will seek to establish the government's green credentials in the face of David Cameron's repositioning of the Conservatives on environmental issues while stressing that ministers will not be thrown off course from adding to housing in Britain. They are determined to see 200,000 homes a year being built within 10 years - 40,000-50,000 more than at present - and are making the issue one of social justice, since without the rise, they say, prices will continue to soar and home ownership will increasingly become the province of the rich. Ms Cooper told the Guardian: \"This is not about symbolic gestures. It is about serious long-term plans to substantially change the way we build and develop. It would be easy to use climate change as a reason to stop development but it would be unsustainable when we need homes for the the next generation. We need to take the opportunity of new homes to change the market and improve our environmental standards.\" The proposals for Northstowe, near Cambridge, are being drawn up by English Partnerships, which owns half the land, and the private company Gallagher. The scheme will go through its planning stages over the next year with building possibly starting late in 2007. Among the ministerial demands for the buildings are good insulation, solar energy devices such as roof-mounted collectors for hot water, large windows on south-facing walls, water recycling, water-efficient fittings, and porous paving to keep rainwater in the ground rather than running into drains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/culturevultureblog/2006/may/26/drivingthedeb","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-26T14:46:53Z","webTitle":"Driving the debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culturevultureblog/2006/may/26/drivingthedeb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culturevultureblog/2006/may/26/drivingthedeb","fields":{"headline":"Driving the debate","bodyText":"Thinking of driving to Hay? ... read on. Photograph: Mike Kittrell/AP. Global warming is a \"national security emergency\" and the country must adopt a \"war footing\" to deal with it, according to one panellist in a debate on the future of the car at this year's Hay Festival, writes science correspondent James Randerson. According to renowned environmentalist Jeremy Leggett, the CEO of Solar Century - a company that promotes solar energy - global warming \"is going to lay waste to national economies and ecosystems with quite the effectiveness of an invading army - therefore we need to mobilise for it on a war footing\". Leggett will be speaking tomorrow at a Hay Festival debate entitled Cars Are Killing The Planet, which is sponsored by The Economist. Channel 4 news frontman and enthusiastic cyclist Jon Snow will chair the discussion. Leggett argues that governments should adopt draconian regulations to, for example, improve fuel efficiency or sweeping changes to planning rules, which would combat urban sprawl and so restrict car use: \"If we really believed in the nature of the threat we wouldn't even question these things. In the same way that we didn't when we had to rapidly find ways of building shed loads of Spitfires and Lancasters.\" Economist writer Vijay Vaitheeswaran will argue that the perceived problems with cars can be solved with new technology. \"The car is one of the greatest inventions of modern times. It means mobility and freedom. It's an extraordinary expression of individual style and personality.\" \"The problem is not cars, the problem is oil,\" he argues. \"The clean car of the future can give us all of the benefits with very few of the problems we mistakenly identify with the car.\" In the short term Vaitheeswaran believes alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel can reduce emissions, for example in Brazil, where half the transport fuel is ethanol from sugar cane. In 20 to 30 years he thinks hydrogen vehicles will take over from our current polluting gas-guzzlers. Another panellist, Green Party MEP Caroline Lucas suggests the glossy magazine image of the car as a symbol of freedom is becoming increasingly removed from reality. \"By the time they introduced the congestion charge in London the idea that driving in London was anything to do with freedom I think would have made most people laugh in a rather hollow way.\" \"On this issue as with so many people are always reaching for a very easy technical fix which means that they can just carry on with business as usual,\" she says. \"Smarter consumption is not enough, we actually have to consume less and that's not as terrifying as many people think. \"If anything else were killing 3,000 people a day we would be having major conferences about how to stop this epidemic, but when its cars we just treat it as some kind of unfortunate and unavoidable byproduct.\" Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, will argue that restricting car use is not practical. \"I'll bet your bottom dollar that three quarters of the people at Hay-on-Wye will have got there by car,\" he said, \"The chattering classes love to criticise the car but they've all got one.

As long as they make record profits from their oil and gas operations while continuing to invest relatively small sums of cash in renewable projects, they are unlikely to see much change. And while campaigning environmentalists do recognise BP and Shell as \"progressives\" compared to industry rivals such as ExxonMobil, they remain sceptical over whether the whole thing extends any deeper than marketing. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth puts it bluntly: \"You will see a lot of advertising from these companies highlighting their green credentials but this is all about trying to boost the morale of their staff and ultimately it's superficial.\" In fact, the decision by John Browne, BP's chief executive, to use the tagline \"beyond petroleum\" while increasing oil output and overall greenhouse gas volumes has left him facing a deeper level of cynicism. Similarly, the harder that Shell works at its environmental assessment studies, at new gas projects such as Sakhalin in Russia, the worse the fall - and criticism - when things go wrong. And no matter how hard ExxonMobil argues that its position on climate change has been misrepresented, few environmentalists are willing to give the Texan giant the benefit of the doubt. Bad publicity seems to have a habit of following these oil majors around. We currently have Shell's aspirations to be a better environmental citizen being undermined by a bruising experience in eastern Russia while BP is under fire over its record in Alaska. Their problems are compounded by earning record profits and yet the bulk of this bounty has been handed back to investors through the buying back of shares or through issuing higher and higher dividends. Capital expenditure has also been concentrated on hydrocarbons but that should not completely overshadow the fact that both BP and Shell have been putting more emphasis on, and more money into, renewables. At the end of last year BP took its most significant step establishing a BP Alternative Energy division with promises that it would spend $8bn over 10 years on renewable projects. Small beer, some might argue, given BP spends more than that amount on oil and gas schemes annually, but not to be sneezed at, considering the company believes it can help reduce forecast greenhouse gas emissions by 24m tonnes a year in 2015. That is the equivalent of making a city as big as Berlin emissions-free, it boasts. Equally, BP is promising to build a world-class wind business and is also ploughing money into hydrogen, which could become the clean fuel of tomorrow. The group is engaged in two groundbreaking schemes to generate power from hydrogen: one at Peterhead in Scotland, the other at Carson in California. The new alternative energy business also has symbolic importance. The company likes to say it has been in solar energy for 30 years but it has all been relatively low-key stuff until last year when revenues leaped by 30% to nearly $500m. Lord Browne will say that he was one of the first oilmen to take global warming seriously. He did pull BP out of the Global Climate Coalition, the US body made up of oil and car companies that campaigned against initiatives such as the Kyoto Treaty back in 1997. But BP, like other oil companies, ultimately believes its role is to provide the world with energy from whatever source is needed and argues that oil and gas will remain dominant for years to come. It therefore approaches the issue of sustainability in various ways - many of them incompatible with the kind of interpretation that Friends of the Earth or Greenpeace would consider acceptable. Lord Browne insists he wants to provide energy \"to fuel human progress and economic growth. It also means satisfying the need for a sustainable environment.\" But then he also says that BP has invested more than $50bn since the turn of the century - mainly in traditional hydrocarbons. \"That will help to provide sustainable supplies of oil and gas for decades to come.\" Shell, too, talks about its commitment to \"sustainable development\" in its general business principles, which were revised and updated in 2005. The Anglo-Dutch group's version of sustainability is \"balancing short- and long-term interests and integrating economic, environmental and social considerations into business decision-making.\" Shell still has 47 traditional oil refineries and a network of 45,000 petrol stations but it, too, has a diversified renewable portfolio, which stretches from hydrogen and biofuels to solar and wind. In fact Shell is at the cutting edge of some of the most dramatic schemes with the world's first hydrogen filling station - in Iceland - and the world's biggest offshore wind farm planned off the coast of Kent. Equally, it is looking at quirky one-off schemes such as using pure C02 for growing fruit and vegetables. This not only cuts 325,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases from the Pernis refinery but also provides cheap - and productive - fuel for growers. Shell, with Norwegian state oil company Statoil, is also working to develop the world's largest offshore project to store carbon. The C02 from a new gas-fired station would be stored permanently but also used to push out higher quantities of oil and gas from two North Sea fields. But while these schemes progress and Shell highlights its new-found sensitivity to the environment, it still marches into new regions of valuable biodiversity such as the Beaufort Sea in Alaska, or Sakhalin. And while it makes far more effort than it would have in the past to accommodate both \"green\" and social concerns, it can still find itself at the centre of a massive row as it has at Sakhalin in Russia. Having changed the direction of pipelines at great cost and monitored the breeding grounds of the Pacific Grey Whale, it finds itself still under attack from NGOs - and more recently the Kremlin - for alleged environmental degradation. Similarly, a gas pipeline in Ireland - from the Corrib field - has put it on the receiving end of huge community anger and protests. Shell is pleased that its total greenhouse gas emissions fell last year but admits this was partly because oil output dropped - something it tried to prevent - and because it reduced flaring at a major field in Nigeria. The company has continually promised to bring an end to all this wasteful and environmentally damaging practice only to set new targets into the future, the latest being an end to \"continuous\" flaring by 2009. Despite this, the company boasts that it scored highest for \"environmental responsibility\" for the fourth year in a row as measured by the 2005 reputation tracker survey. But this was a Mori poll that Shell itself commissioned and it is clear that the man and woman in the street remain wary, if not downright sceptical, of big business and particularly big oil. The only certainty oil companies face is that the standards expected of them will rise as public awareness increases about the environmental fragility of the planet. · Terry Macalister is industrial correspondent of the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2006/sep/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview6","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-29T23:05:55Z","webTitle":"Review: Heat by George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2006/sep/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview6","fields":{"headline":"Change or die","bodyText":"Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning by George Monbiot 277pp, Allen Lane, £17.99 The 1959 film of Nevil Shute's On the Beach depicts a world in its dying days. After a nuclear war, lethal fallout is gradually being carried on the wind to all four corners of the world. The film concludes with a lingering shot of a banner flying in a deserted Melbourne street: \"There is still time ... brother.\" For the fictional inhabitants of Melbourne - and the world - it was too late. For cinema audiences, however, many of whom wept openly after seeing On the Beach, there was still time to act. Such fictions played an important role in raising awareness about the threat of nuclear war. We stared into the abyss and then stepped back from the brink. Today we face a threat as terrible in its way as nuclear holocaust: global warming. According to George Monbiot, climate change denial is beginning to look \"as stupid as Holocaust denial, or the insistence that Aids can be cured with beetroot\". The latest research suggests that if carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere remain what they are today, by 2030, global temperatures will rise by 2C. Above this level major ecosystems begin collapsing: rather than absorbing carbon dioxide, the dying Amazonian rainforest will begin releasing millions of tonnes of it. And elsewhere, as the permafrost melts, the ground releases greenhouse gases. Climate change will spiral out of control. To avoid this, says Monbiot, we must prevent global average temperatures rising beyond this \"critical threshold\". It's possible that we have already passed the point of no return. But, says Monbiot, he is writing \"in the spirit of optimism\". Like the characters in Shute's novel and film, we are all living in denial about the catastrophe that is about to engulf us. One of Monbiot's environmentalist friends spends her holidays snorkelling in the Pacific. \"She doesn't get there by bicycle,\" he adds angrily. Another burns coal on an open fire. Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay, sings about people mistreating the planet and then boasts about how his band flies everywhere by private jet. In just 30 years' time, this country will be \"profoundly and catastrophically different\". So where are the mass demonstrations? \"We are simply too comfortable, and we have too much to lose.\" Monbiot sets himself the task of persuading us that climate change is worth fighting. At the very least he wants to \"make people so depressed about the state of the planet that they stay in bed all day, thereby reducing their consumption of fossil fuels\". Heat is a solidly researched manifesto for change. Monbiot regards the threat as so obvious and the need for action so urgent that he wastes little time combating the arguments of sceptics such as Bjørn Lomborg. According to Monbiot, we need a global reduction of 60% in emissions to avoid hitting the critical threshold. This means the richest nations will need to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. The Kyoto protocol envisaged a 5.2% cut by 2012. In the UK, we need to get our carbon emissions of 2.6 tonnes per person down to 0.33 tonnes. Monbiot's first thought was that this would be impossible. But in Heat he argues convincingly that a medium-sized industrial nation like the UK can be \"de-carbonised while remaining a modern economy\". He proposes a system of carbon units, or \"icecaps\": \"it enables us to cap our carbon emissions to keep the planet cool.\" Every person in the world will have an annual carbon allowance. But to make the new rationing scheme feasible, governments have to establish a carbon-neutral infrastructure: that means redesigning our transport systems to cure us of our addiction to cars; electricity generation not from nuclear but renewables and gas-fired power stations utilising carbon capture and storage; and a new national grid that will make wind turbines on the continental shelf and solar power from the Sahara viable: \"High Voltage Direct Current cables ... could change the world\". Energy-efficient housing is an area where individuals and governments both need to take action, particularly in Britain. He admits that his home, built in the 1900s and refurbished with scant regard for energy efficiency, is a typical \"ecological disaster.\" Demand for energy across the UK rose by 7.3% between 1990 and 2003; but in our homes it rose by 19%. Building regulations in Sweden were tougher in 1978 than they are in Britain today: \"our builders get away with practices very similar to those that prevailed in 1900.\" On becoming chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel declared that she would provide £1bn annually to ensure that every house in the country would be air-tight and properly insulated within 20 years. But in Britain, the minister for housing and planning, Yvette Cooper, described proposals to introduce proper energy-efficiency standards for the refurbishment of houses as \"unnecessary gold plating\", a phrase Monbiot bitterly recalls every time he pays his gas bill. One eminently sensible suggestion he makes is that a rebate on stamp duty could be used to help pay for refurbishment and insulation of existing homes. Monbiot comes up with some ingenious solutions to cut carbon while preserving our lifestyles. There is, however, one carbon extravagance he insists the planet can no longer afford: air travel. A return flight to New York creates more greenhouse gases per passenger than the total amount Monbiot says we should be allowed to use as individuals in a year. \"The growth in aviation and the need to address climate change cannot be reconciled.\" A 90% cut in carbon emissions means that there can be no more shopping trips to New York or parties in Ibiza, \"unless you believe that these activities are worth the sacrifice of the biosphere and the lives of the poor\". Heat, he writes, is \"both a manifesto for action and a thought experiment\". The combination of practical detail and creative thinking is immensely impressive. Monbiot concludes that \"it is possible to save the biosphere\", but we must be prepared to accept that setting a limit on our freedom to pollute means all our lives will change. What we need now is \"bold politics and ambitious engineering\". The catalogue of political failure Monbiot describes does not give one much cause for hope. For example, the budget for widening the M1 is £3.6bn - seven times more than is spent annually in the UK on tackling climate change. But we can do it. As someone once said, \"if sunbeams were weapons of war, we'd have had solar energy long ago\". · PD Smith is writing a cultural history of science and superweapons for Penguin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2008/jan/05/budget.hotels","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-05T23:44:02Z","webTitle":"50 hotels under £50","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jan/05/budget.hotels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2008/jan/05/budget.hotels","fields":{"headline":"Thrifty fifty","bodyText":"The Americas Hotel Marionetas, Merida, Mexico It takes its name from a puppet theatre that once resided in the building.

With the hefty rises in electricity and gas prices over the past year, the lining is that solar power, for most of us, is now a realistic, cost-effective option. Until recently the expense of putting solar panels on the roof meant only a few eco-warriors with money were doing it. Anyone else concluded that the payback period was too long. But solar power, if you will pardon the phrase, is fast coming in from the cold. Sure, the payback time is still long, at 15 years or more. But the annual savings on electricity or gas bills - which is, I think, a better way of looking at it - is now at least as good, if not better, than sticking spare cash in a building society. And that is based on the cash yield on the capital. It does not include the value of carbon dioxide not emitted or the satisfaction of walking the walk, rather than talking the talk, on global warming. The payback time would matter if a solar system added no value. But evidence suggests solar power can add nearly 9% to a property's value. Another misconception is that solar thermal panels, which heat water, are cheaper than photovoltaic (PV) panels, which produce electricity. Though it is true that PV panels are pricey, a 50% government grant roughly equalises the cost to the consumer per unit of energy generated by each type of system. A typical solar thermal system can often generate all the hot water needed in the summer and 20% in the winter, so 50%-60% year round. So what you will save? Panels of about 2 sq metres claim to save the equivalent of about 1,100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year. The savings depend on what you heat your water with. If you are off the national grid and using oil or liquefied petroleum gas, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) figures show you could save about £150 a year. For mains gas, which is an efficient way to heat water, the saving is smaller, at about £50 a year. As a return on the cheapest system I was quoted for (£3,100, fully installed, including the standard £400 grant), the yield ranges from 1.6% to 4.25% - the latter easily beating most savings rates. You also save from using your boiler less. Many people with thermal panels do not use the boiler between May and October. That means servicing the boiler every two years instead of annually, maybe saving £50 a year. Assuming the boiler will last longer because it is used less and given the cost of new boilers, extending its life could save £50 a year. Limits Add that £100 to your saving and you have a yield of 4.25% on mains gas and up to 8% on other fuels, a fine return indeed. You could even add the carbon dioxide saving. This is a difficult one but some economists \"value\" a tonne of CO2 at about £20. Domestic solar systems save 1-2 tonnes a year of CO2, adding a theoretical £20 to £40 a year of savings. There are limits to thermal. You can only use so much hot water. You may be on holiday for some of your summer peak-generation time. Modern washing machines and dishwashers tend to have cold water feeds and heat water with an electric element. So hot water is mainly for showers. So you can save only 10-15% of domestic energy use a year. You may also have to fit a new hot tank and intrusive plumbing from the roof panels. For these reasons, PV is gaining in popularity. An installed 1kW system costs about £3,500 (after a 50% grant), rising to £9,000 for 3kW. They are often guaranteed for 25 years - manufacturers such as Sharp and Sanyo are confident their products could last a century. They also return the energy used in their construction in only two to three years. PV has no intrusive plumbing, merely a cable to the electricity meter. Currys recently began selling this type. They save about 900kWh a year per kilowatt installed. A 2kW system generates about 1,800 kWh - half what a typical family uses in a year. This not only saves the current 12p/kWh average electricity price but you can get another 3.3p/kWh via the regulator Ofgem once a year. That means nearly £300 a year in savings - a return on the installation cost of £6,200 (my best quote so far) of 4.7%. Not bad. Although there are not the boiler cost savings of thermal, PV systems are \"fit and forget\" with few maintenance costs. And they save money when you are not at home - you can sell the excess generated back to the utility companies. Older electrical meters will actually turn backwards when you are not at home using electricity. How cool is that? Because of this, bigger systems are possible with PV than thermal. PV is especially worthwhile if your roof is being replaced. There are now PV roof tiles and slates so if you have a builder already replacing your roof, the extra cost of using PV tiles is low. Many fans of solar energy fit both systems, which together can easily generate 40% of total household energy. One wonders why the government is so keen on boosting nuclear energy again. Such a project would cost near to £10,000 but the return would be the same as putting money in the bank. Jeremy Leggett, of Britain's leading PV supplier, Solar Century, argues that as energy prices are certain to rise further, savings will increase. \"There is zero chance of energy prices coming down. This is one of the best investments you can make,\" he says. If they do fall, your return falls too. But then you can enjoy doing your bit for the environment and that, one might say, is priceless. So is the solar market about to boom? The experts think so. Richard Cockayne of yourwelcome.co.uk, a retailer of energy-saving technology, says: \"You have got to be from Mars if you don't see there is going to be massive growth.\" Surging New markets always reach a tipping point when production rises enough to lower costs sufficiently to raise demand. China accounts for 80% of the world thermal market with 65m square metres of panels on roofs. But China's high volumes and low costs mean a system costs only £200, a 10th of the price here. As with PV, prices are very high now because of a shortage of silicon but that is likely to be overcome in the next few years. But demand is already surging, as the graph shows. So why wait? The returns already justify the outlay and, if you are worried about global warming, this is a concrete step you can take with tried and tested technology. Just do it. ashley.seager@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2005/may/06/energy.environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2005-05-06T10:49:48Z","webTitle":"Huge solar power station planned for Portugal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/may/06/energy.environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2005/may/06/energy.environment","fields":{"headline":"Huge solar power station planned for Portugal","bodyText":"A plan to build the world's biggest solar energy power station, covering about 250 hectares and capable of sustaining 130,000 households, has been unveiled in Portugal. The park would be visible from space, according to a spokesman for the owners of the site at an abandoned pyrite mine near the town of Beja, in the southern Alentejo region. With a potential output of 116 megawatts, the new station would be several times the size of what is now the world's largest solar energy plant. The output would be fed into the Portuguese electricity grid at a government-set price. A consortium of mainly German companies plans to erect 116 hexagonal clusters of solar panels. A German manufacturer of solar panels has said it also plans to build a factory at the site, bringing 250 permanent jobs to one of the poorest regions of Europe. The Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Negocios reported yesterday that investment would total €426m (£290m) and the multinational company Siemens would be involved in building the power plant. The Mina Sao Domingos pyrite mine was run by a British company, Mason and Barry. The mine, founded in the 1870s and closed in the 1960s, was run by British engineers for much of its life and involved both opencast and underground excavation. Helmfield Horster, managing director of the company that owns the site, said the banks and inclines of the reservoirs were already close to having the 32 degree slope that allows solar panels to make best use of the sun's rays. \"That means we will be able to mount most of them on wooden frames rather than the metal ones that are often used,\" he said. Mr Horster said that the yellow banks would have to be covered with something dark grey. Acid water that had pooled in the reservoirs has killed all vegetation. Mr Horster said permission had already been granted by the environment ministry and the consortium was awaiting the go-ahead from the Portuguese government. \"There has been a change of government so they have not had time to look at it yet,\" he said. With 1,890 kilowatt hours of sunshine per square metre a year, the parched and thinly populated Alentejo is one of the most promising areas on the continent for solar power. \"This is definitely one of the sunniest spots in Europe,\" Mr Horster said. He added that the solar park and factory would have a big impact on the Alentejo region, creating three jobs in ancillary areas for every employee working directly on the solar power plant or in the factory. \"It will have a structural effect on the whole area,\" he said. \"The local authorities are very enthusiastic.\" The project would be financed by special renewable energy investment funds set up by international banks. Building the full new power plant will take four to five years. With the old mine site occupying much more than the 250 hectares (620 acres) set aside for the project the consortium said that it could expand operations if that became necessary. Last year a solar power plant near Leipzig pronounced itself to be the world's largest, though it produces a relatively small five megawatts on a 20 hectare site. A 15 megawatt solar power station being built in South Korea is due to be opened next year. Israel, meanwhile, is reportedly planning a 100 megawatt solar power station for the Negev desert - with potential for expansion at a later date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2006/sep/23/ethicalliving.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-23T12:05:43Z","webTitle":"Home directory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/23/ethicalliving.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/sep/23/ethicalliving.energy","fields":{"headline":"Home directory","bodyText":"ENERGY INFORMATION The Energy Saving Trust 0845 727 7200, www.est.org.uk/myhome Non-profit organisation promoting energy efficiency.

FURTHER READING There are dozens of books offering you tips for lowering your domestic carbon footprint, but the Guardian’s own A Good Life: the Guide to Ethical Living by Leo Hickman is one of the easiest to follow (honestly). On a higher, less immediately practical level, the Humanure Handbook by Joe Jenkins is a wonderful classic about the potential usefulness of, er, poo. Green Books and the Centre For Alternative Technology are good places to go for specific information on solar power, wind power and composting. The new Grand Designs Handbook by Kevin McCloud is full of tips from projects featured in the TV series. Out Of The Woods by Pat Borer and Cindy Harris is the first book to turn to if you want to try a bit of self-build, closely followed by the Green Building Bible, which publishes a new, two-volume edition in October (newbuilder.co.uk). The Shelter Sketchbook by John S Taylor (first published in 1983) is a beautiful book containing Taylor’s drawings of architectural ideas and innovations all around the world. • This article was amended on 3 July 2019.

Perched at the very edge of the continent, in Svalbard, Norway, a mere 600 miles from the North Pole, the centre's international scientists have been experiencing weather that is becoming increasingly unpredictable. The archipelago should still be gripped by ice and screaming winds. But to their surprise, researchers have found conditions on Svalbard have been balmy and calm. Last month, Vigdis Tverberg of the Norwegian Polar Institute, reported that waters in the Kongsfjorden - the long strip of water that pokes eastwards into mainland Svalbard at Ny-Alesund - were now 2C warmer than they used to be a few years ago. Two degrees may seem a modest rise, but the effects are profound, as Tverberg stressed: 'Normally, the temperature in the fjord would be close to freezing. This winter the cooling of the water has probably never been close enough to produce an ice cover.' Thus a major strip of water, on a latitude parallel to the northernmost tip of Greenland, failed to produce a covering of ice this year. The inference is clear, say researchers. Global warming, driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is not only increasing air temperatures, it is causing the oceans to warm alarmingly. Neither is Kongsfjorden unique. According to Tverberg's colleague, Sebastian Gerland, all the other fjords on this normally ice-locked coastline have remained open, thanks to the startling warming of their waters. Polar ice is not so much dwindling, as scientists once suggested might happen, it is disappearing before our eyes. The implications are deeply worrying, as Graham Shimmield, director of the Dunstaffnage Marine laboratory, in Scotland, points out. His researchers have just finished a survey of Kongsfjorden in a bid to find out the effects of climate change on its marine life. 'There is a very carefully delineated food chain in the Arctic,' he said. 'Plankton are eaten by fish, which are eaten by seals, which are eaten by polar bears. It has been a very stable supply for a long time. Now the whole chain is changing and we have no idea what the consequences will be. For the polar bear, which is already suffering because it has less pack ice to hunt on, the problem is particularly worrying.' The likely impact on wildlife is clearly disturbing. But the issues go far beyond concerns for polar creatures. They sound an alarm bell for the entire planet. For years, scientists have stressed the Arctic and the Antarctic are the most climatically sensitive parts of our planet. Global warming was always going to hit the poles with disproportionate severity, they said. Now those predictions are being proved correct, not just in the warming waters off Svalbard but in the melting glaciers of Greenland and the disappearing ice sheets of west Antarctica. In the case of Greenland, scientists at Nasa and the University of Kansas reported this year that previous estimates of the rate of melting of Greenland's glaciers had been too low and too optimistic in assuming it would take centuries to heat and melt its massive ice shield. Instead, when Nasa's Eric Rignot, and Pannir Kanagaratnam, of Kansas University, studied Greenland's glaciers, they uncovered an unexpected effect. As air temperatures have risen - roughly 3C in the Arctic over the past two decades - the resulting meltwater has poured to the bases of glaciers and acted as a lubricant. Thus the marches to the sea of these great rivers of ice are being accelerated, raising the amount of ice dumped in the Atlantic each year from 100 cubic kilometres in 1996 to 220 last year. Neither is the Antarctic exempt. In March, scientists from the University of Colorado at Boulder, using satellites to monitor tiny fluctuations in Earth's gravity, concluded that the continent is now losing similar amounts of ice, about 150 cubic kilometres a year. This will have several profound consequences, say scientists. First, it will help to increase the rate at which sea levels are now rising. At present, the figure is about 2mm a year, but it is destined to increase considerably over the coming decades. For countries such as Holland, a quarter of which currently lies below sea level; for low-lying Bangladesh; and for coral island nations such as the Maldives, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, it is a deeply worrying prospect, particularly as climatologists also predict increased numbers of major storms as another consequence of global warming. All these places will become increasingly vulnerable to massive sea surges sweeping over their strained ocean defences. Already the world's coral reefs and islands are suffering: swamped by rising waters, battered by storms and bleached by seas becoming increasingly acidic from the carbon dioxide they are absorbing. It is a grim prospect. Yet there may be even more worrying, more serious effects triggered by the disappearance of the polar ice caps. Those vast sheets of bright, white ice make near-perfect mirrors that shine back 80 per cent of the sunlight that falls on them. Thus they help to keep our planet cool. This measure of reflectivity is known as albedo (from the Latin word for whiteness). A perfect reflector would have an albedo of 1.0, The albedo for polar ice is around 0.8. By contrast, the albedo for sea water is around 0.07. The difference between these two figures is stark. Ice has one of the highest albedos of any substance on Earth, sea water has one of the lowest, so we are replacing our planet's best reflector with one of the worst. In this way, more and more solar energy is being absorbed as ice cover is lost, causing the oceans to heat up even more - which, of course, will trigger even further losses of ice. Thus a nudge provided by modestly increased carbon dioxide levels is amplified into a major change. The bad news doesn't stop here, however. There is the issue of the melting of the planet's permafrost, the thick layer of frozen soil covering much of the ground in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The trouble, as Elizabeth Kolbert points out in her newly published analysis of Earth's climatic woes, Field Notes from a Catastrophe, is that the permafrost acts as a repository for greenhouse gases. One estimate suggests there are 450 billion tonnes of the stuff locked up in the world's permafrost. 'As the climate warms, there is a good chance that these gases will be released into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming,' she says. These two effects, loss of albedo, and the release of permafrost gases, are known as tipping points. Once passed, reversal becomes nigh impossible. As Kolbert says, the climate is like a rowing boat. You can tip it and it will return to an even keel. You can tip it again, and once more it will return to its original state. But if you tip just a little too far, it will capsize. That is the danger Earth now faces: the overturning of our climate system, from its relatively stable, moderate status to one in which we have recreated the climate of the Cretaceous era, when there were crocodiles at the poles and the planet cooked. The question is: how did the planet reach its current status? More importantly, what can be done to halt our seemingly relentless passage towards the Cretaceous? The answer to the first question is, of course, the easier. It can be traced to the moment, in 1765, when James Watt - wandering across Glasgow Green - conceived of the idea of a separate condenser for the steam engine. Patented in 1769, his invention made steam power feasible and economic. It unleashed the Industrial Age; the burning of Earth's fossil reserves of coal, oil and gas; and the injecting of much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In those days, there were approximately 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That level has inexorably increased, indeed it has accelerated, until today, when there are about 380. And most scientists do not envisage this rise flattening out until it reaches 500 to 550 ppm, a prospect that has deeply unsettling implications. Carbon dioxide - like all other greenhouse gases - absorbs the solar energy that perpetually beats down on our world, holds it, then radiates some back to Earth. The effect is to heat up the atmosphere. This is not necessarily a bad thing. If there were no greenhouse gases, our world would be a decidedly chilly one, as the pioneering British physicist John Tyndall realised almost 150 years ago. Were it not for heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide, solar radiation would be reflected straight back into space. 'The warmth of our fields and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space,' he wrote. 'The sun would rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost.' On the other hand, if you get too much of the stuff, problems arise, as is revealed through the example of our sister planet Venus. Although its orbit is relatively close to Earth's, and its size is almost identical, conditions there are as near to hell as you could envisage because its atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. The greenhouse effect there generates surface temperatures of 450C, hot enough to melt lead. No scientist is predicting such a fate for the Earth, of course. Nevertheless, our world cannot avoid disruption even if it could limit global warming to an increase of only a few degrees. The issue is: how can we mitigate the changes we have unleashed? More importantly, have we the political will to carry out the industrial makeover needed to flatten out that curve of rising carbon emissions before our viability as a species is threatened? As you will see in the pages of this supplement, there are many eminent scientists and experts who remain optimistic. Equally, there are those who feel the prospects for our planet are hopeless. Both are united on one issue, however: no matter how bleak our position, there can be no excuse for inaction. It is a point stressed by the US anthropologist Jared Diamond. In his recent book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, he outlines examples of societies - such as the Vikings in Greenland - who refused to changes their ways and perished as climate change swept their Arctic colonies. By contrast, there is the example of the people of Tikopia, in the Pacific, who when faced with environmental devastation caused by pigs, their favourite source of protein, that were rooting up and destroying their farmlands, acted with commendable decisiveness. They slaughtered every pig on the island. Our prospects and our choices may not be quite as stark as that - at least not yet. Indeed, as we make clear in the rest of this section, we have many courses of action. We are still in control of our own fates. As Diamond stresses: 'Because we are the cause of our environmental problems, we are the ones in control of them, and we can choose or not choose to stop causing and start solving them. We don't need new technologies to solve our problems; while new technologies can make some contribution, for the most part we just need the political will to apply solutions already available. Of course, that's a big \"just\". But many societies did find the necessary political will in the past.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2006/apr/26/replytojeremyleggett","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2006-04-26T13:41:13Z","webTitle":"The impossible dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/26/replytojeremyleggett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/26/replytojeremyleggett","fields":{"headline":"The impossible dream","bodyText":"If, a few months ago, a columnist for the Guardian had written the article I wrote on Tuesday, I would have attacked it in the same terms as Jeremy Leggett uses today. So what has changed? Have I, as one or two people have suggested, sold my soul to the fossil fuel industry? Well no - I hate it as much as ever. By contrast, I love the idea that we could meet our energy needs through a combination of improved efficiency and renewable technologies. The problem is this: that over the past few months I have been ferreting out every figure I can find in an attempt to discover what is and isn't possible. I have discovered that the dream I entertained - of an economy powered entirely by ambient energy - is simply impossible to realise. If we could magic away the entire housing stock and replace it with passive houses - which require no heating apparatus of any kind - the problem would be solved. But our housing stock is in a dreadful state, and at current rates of demolition and rebuilding it would take 1700 years to replace. After examining every possible efficiency measure and low carbon technology that could be retrofitted to our homes, Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute concluded that we might just scrape a 60% carbon cut by 2050. But \"in reality, these targets are approaching the extreme end of the policy envelope: it would be close to inconceivable to plan for tougher standards ... on this timescale\". As readers of my column will know, 60% by 2050 (which is the government's target) doesn't take us anywhere near the point of avoiding dangerous climate change. Jeremy asserts that \"our feeble sun is capable of generating far more electricity than the country uses, were we to deploy the current generation of solar photovoltaic rooftiles on available roofspace\". This is not the first time I have seen him make this claim: it also features in his book Half Gone. Because strong claims require strong support, you would expect it to come from a good source: a peer-reviewed academic journal or a government report, for example. Here is the reference he gives. \"'Solar Energy: brilliantly simple', BP pamphlet, available on UK petrol forecourts\". The Energy Technology Support Unit, which deals in real numbers rather than corporate hype, calculated that if all the roofs in the United Kingdom were covered in solar panels, and solar electricity could miraculously be produced at the same rate at all points of the compass, the \"maximum practicable resource\" would be 266 terawatt hours (TWh) per year. The UK currently uses some 400 TWh. But solar panels will produce appreciable quantities of electricity only in the south-east to south-west quadrant. If its estimate were divided by four, that would give us 66.5 TWh. But this takes no account of the cost. When the unit confined its estimates to the amount of electricity which could be produced at 7 pence per kilowatt hour or less (roughly the retail price of electricity) it found that the technical potential of roofs in the United Kingdom by 2025 was 0.5 terawatt hours, or one 800th of our consumption. This estimate is too harsh, and the electricity price has risen and the technology has improved since it was made, but it is obvious to anyone who has studied the actual data, rather than corporate PR materials, that solar power simply cannot supply our needs, not least because peak electricity demand in the United Kingdom is between 5 and 7pm on a winter's evening. Do I need to spell this out? I applaud Jeremy's efforts to attach solar cells to every available roof in this country, and this must be part of the solution. But I cannot see how it helps us to pretend that we can solve this problem with resources that do not exist. If we're really interested in stopping climate change rather than striking ideological poses, we are going to have to make some very hard choices, some of which - as I have found - conflict with our instincts. I don't like the position I have had to take any more than Jeremy does, but we cannot save the biosphere by means of wishful thinking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2006/aug/08/comment.politics1","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-07T23:05:02Z","webTitle":"Polly Toynbee: Britain can still lead the world - on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/08/comment.politics1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/08/comment.politics1","fields":{"headline":"Britain can still lead the world - on climate change","bodyText":"If politics is the art of the possible, then Tony Blair is spending far too much of his energy on the impossible. Like all leaders long in office, once absorbed by the great powerplay of global conflicts, the banalities of the mundane pall. But it is the politics of the impossible to imagine that he can have any significant influence now over the necessary step-by-step cooling of the Lebanon crisis. He can hardly help prevent a terrifying Middle East conflagration when he has helped throw fuel on that fire. Eagerly Downing Street lists his many phone calls with key leaders, but you will find scant mention of Blair's role in the foreign press. Instead the draft UN resolution is being negotiated between France and the US. Chirac, cynical old arms salesman, has carved himself a niche as peace statesman, leader of the planned new UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon. That may be bitter for Blair the global moraliser, but it is the price for getting Iraq so wrong. As Baghdad disintegrates into ungovernability, war-party Britain is just a minor US adjunct and Yo Blair isn't even wanted as a US go-between. Britain's age-old grand illusion about its place in the world led Blair into this Iraq disaster: now some humility on war and peace would be more dignified than further grandiose self-delusion. Instead let him return to that greater global threat - climate change - about which he has been almost as rhetorically loud on the world stage. With Europe and America sweltering and drought parching southern Britain, he was in California striking a usefully symbolic carbon-trading deal with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has upped Britain's pledge in a tougher carbon trading regime for the second EU round. But since 1997 UK emissions are up 3%. In hard reality, we are middling in the EU emissions tables; no aspect of Britain's climate-change policy leads the world, except rhetorically. But it is well within the politics of the possible to change that. As it is, Germany has a 1m-homes-a-year insulation scheme: ours is in the thousands. We have the EU's biggest wind capacity, but fall far behind in wind farms. We have the dirtiest cars and the most expensive public transport. Market leaders in biomass, wave power and solar energy are elsewhere. However, at last it looks as if Labour's younger generation of ministers are seizing the initiative. Blair and Brown have shied away from anything that might mean voters taking any pain. When the prime minister dropped into Radio 1 yesterday to promise every household a carbon audit, replace all Downing Street light bulbs and turn down the central heating, that was useful but still the easy bit. It is David Miliband and Douglas Alexander who are confronting the hard questions. Significantly neither was a minister during the event that scared Blair and Brown into paralysis. It seems extraordinary that a handful of right-wing farmers with tractors laying siege to power stations could so warp climate-change policy. But the fuel protests frightened Labour from ever suggesting the public should make any sacrifice in its use and abuse of cheap energy. Now Alexander is putting forward a bill to introduce charging on trunk roads all over the country, with a congestion-charging system for any city that wants one. The environment audit committee is calling on him to set a £1,800 excise-duty differential between the most and least polluting cars. If the money raised is poured back into better public transport, this will shift more journeys from cars on to buses and trains. Miliband's rousing end-of-term speech advocated the one idea that could make most difference - a personal carbon-trading scheme. If all energy from gas and electricity at home, petrol in cars and air travel were apportioned fairly as a quota per head, people with above-average use would have to buy any extra they needed, while under-users sell their spare capacity. People would save points from car travel in order to take an extra flight, or turn down the heating to earn more petrol. Before he was brutally evicted from Defra, along with any minister who had doubts about new nuclear power, Elliott Morley had commissioned a feasibility study for this idea, starting by applying it just to surface transport. That plan, landing on Miliband's desk, looks relatively easy. Just as people have petrol loyalty cards, so they would have a transport credit card awarding points. Use more than your ration and the card can be topped up for a price, while unused points can be traded in for cash. Miliband said a full scheme including all domestic energy would take 10 years - but Morley's first step for transport could be done quickly. In the end fair rationing is the only way. Despite recent price rises, energy in Britain is almost the cheapest in the EU. Only huge energy taxes would change most people's habits. But a system that allowed non-drivers (the poor) to sell their quota to gas-guzzlers and frequent flyers would be massively redistributive. Since British politics of left and right still feels the need to talk presumptuously in terms of \"leading the world\", there is no reason why Britain should not lead the world and show that a domestic carbon-trading scheme can work. It would make the public razor-sharp about how much energy they use. Suddenly cutting carbon would become a one-upmanship game that might, I suspect, particularly suit the British psyche. Up on the island of Lewis, if the Scottish parliament gives the go-ahead, Britain might at least start to catch up. Two large wind farms will produce 20% of Scotland's electricity and 6% of Britain's renewable energy target. But that's just the start. The Western Isles council plans to turn the area into a mighty alternative generator, ploughing money back into wind and wave, creating jobs and trouncing the wind-doubters. In the meantime, Friends of the Earth is pressing the government to put into the Queen's speech a legally binding law to cut emissions by 3% a year - a cross-party bill drafted by Michael Meacher, Norman Baker and John Gummer. The distant target of a 60% cut by 2050 will be far too late. And will Gordon Brown have the nerve to put a windfall tax on the oil companies' gigantic profits from Middle East calamity, to pay for alternative research? Meanwhile we can wring our hands over the unfolding crisis in the Middle East, to which Britain has contributed in Iraq. But beyond offering support to the best chances of peace, it is better not to be further deluded about British usefulness now. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2006/jan/22/nuclearindustry.greenpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-01-22T02:17:20Z","webTitle":"Blair warned on 'rush for nuclear'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/jan/22/nuclearindustry.greenpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/jan/22/nuclearindustry.greenpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Blair warned on 'rush for nuclear'","bodyText":"A senior cabinet minister has warned the Prime Minister that controversial proposals to build new nuclear power stations across Britain have hidden costs and consequences for climate change. Peter Hain, the Northern Ireland and Welsh Secretary, said the nuclear industry must prove it was a better bet than wind and wave power, arguing that its process - touted as better for the environment than dirty coal-fired stations - actually produced high amounts of carbon, which is linked to global warming. His words will be seen not just as a shot across the bows of Downing Street, which wants a new generation of nuclear power stations, but as the outbreak of 'green wars' with the new Tory leader, David Cameron. Both men pride themselves on eco-friendliness. Hain accused the Conservative leader of doing a U-turn on the issue, revealing that the Tory leader had once criticised a planned wind farm as a 'bird blender' - a reference to local fears of birds flying into the spinning turbines - and yet made great public play last week of switching his home energy bills to a green supplier specialising in power derived from just such wind farms. The attack comes ahead of a government energy review to be launched this week. This is designed to combat fears that the lights in Britain could go out within two decades, as dwindling domestic reserves force this country to depend on oil and gas primarily from Russia and the Middle East. Although the review has been viewed merely as a technicality ahead of approving a new generation of nuclear power stations, Hain told The Observer there would be no blank cheque for the nuclear industry. 'The review has got to have the drains up on the costs of nuclear: not just the upfront cost, the decommissioning costs, the waste storage costs - they all in themselves have quite high carbon emission consequences,' he said. 'There has to be an assessment of what you could do with the billions that would be spent on nuclear power, [if you spent it] on renewable energy.' Hain's family home in south Wales is equipped with photovoltaic cells, which trap solar energy to provide heating and hot water. Not to be outdone, Cameron is considering installing a wind turbine on his roof. Beneath the green stand-off lies a deeper battle, however, for liberal voters. Hain admitted that Labour had 'lost a lot of progressive opinion' which it must recapture with new ideas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2006/mar/02/energy.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-03-02T00:14:11Z","webTitle":"Portugal powers ahead as wind champion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/mar/02/energy.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/mar/02/energy.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Portugal powers ahead as wind champion","bodyText":"Portugal signalled the launch of one of Europe's biggest wind power projects yesterday - a move that will supply enough electricity for 750,000 homes. The contract is the equivalent to a quarter of all the wind power installed in the European Union last year. It will help cement the growing reputation of Portugal - a country importing 86% of its energy needs - as a renewable energy champion. This year, it has already approved the building of the world's largest solar plant. The new wind project will rank Portugal alongside Denmark and Spain as the European countries with the highest proportion of wind energy in the national grid. It will more than double wind power capacity in Portugal. The winning consortium will be asked to erect about 500 turbines at various locations. \"This is definitely one of the biggest tenders we've seen [in Europe],\" Christian Kjaer, policy director at the Brussels-based European Wind Energy Association, told Reuters news agency. \"We've seen those [auctions] more in the United States and Canada.\" Half a dozen consortiums featuring some of Europe's biggest power companies were expected to have lodged their bids for the two-phase 1,500-megawatt project by last night's deadline. The winner is expected to be announced during the summer. Portugal's Socialist government also aims to create 1,600 jobs by allocating €900m (£613m) for turbine equipment manufacturing. With a 520-mile coastline, often battered by Atlantic gales, Portugal is well-placed to take advantage of wind power. Last year, the country increased its wind power target for 2010 from 3,750 to 4,400MW. Lisbon is looking to wind to help meet its goals under the Kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The country's emissions surged almost 37% from 1990 to 2003 - the third-highest increase in the world. One of the EU's poorer countries has, however, already shown signs of leading Europe in renewable energy. Its energy plans range from the world's first commercial wave farm to putting a hydroelectric dam on its last big undammed river, the Sabor. The government set aside a €2.5bn renewable energy war chest last year. It recently granted a licence for the world's biggest solar energy plant, which will be able to produce enough electricity to power 21,000 homes for the southern town of Moura. The 62MW plant will use 350,000 solar panels spread over an area the size of 150 football pitches. It will be 12 times the size of the biggest solar power plant currently in operation near Leipzig, Germany. A wave power plant is also being established near the northern town of Povoa de Varzim. Using sausage-shaped floating generators made by a Scottish company to lap up energy from the Atlantic, it is due to generate sufficient power by the end of this year to supply 1,200 homes. Some energy experts predict that Portugal could eventually produce 20% of its needs from the sea. Gathering force The global wind power market increased by 43% last year. The total capacity now stands at 59,322MW. This is a fraction of the total electricity supply, but the figure is rapidly growing. The countries with the highest total installed capacity are Germany (18,428MW), Spain (10,027) the US (9,149), India (4,430) and Denmark (3,122). Britain, China, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Portugal have all reached the 1,000MW mark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2006/may/17/post95","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-17T14:34:14Z","webTitle":"How much will you pay?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/17/post95","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/may/17/post95","fields":{"headline":"How much will you pay?","bodyText":"If you believe nuclear power is dangerous or immoral under any circumstances, read no further; your mind's made up. Dust off your wellies and anoraks, crank up the photocopier and the server, start designing your stickers - you've got a lot of protesting to do over the next 10 years if you want to prevent new nuclear reactors springing up like mushrooms (not, we hope, as mushroom clouds) the length and breadth of the British Isles. If, on the other hand, you're prepared to believe modern nuclear power stations can be built to be safe (and I lean towards that view), and you believe they could be a good way of ensuring Britain's energy security while minimising harm to the environment, read on. My question is simple: how much are you prepared to pay? The British nuclear lobby's campaign for a new generation of reactors, which Tony Blair has bought into, has two parts. One, the publicly louder but less important part, is to argue the environmental, safety, employment and energy security case for nuclear. The second, by far the most important part, is to obscure the fact that nuclear power is too expensive to get by without subsidies. From the way the nuclear debate is being reported in the British media - even, it has to be said, the Guardian - the public could be forgiven for thinking that there is a law in Britain against building nuclear power stations. There isn't. So why is the private sector not busily building them, here, or in the United States? And what is it that the nuclear lobby wants from the government to enable its new reactors to get built, if the government has no legal objection to them? The answer, of course, is money. When last year I asked Keith Parker, the former DTI civil servant who is now chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, what it wanted the government to do in order to get new reactors built, he gave me a four-point wish list - to shorten the planning application process for reactors, to pay for inspectors to certify new reactor designs, to support a complete programme of ten identical reactors to lower costs, and to guarantee a minimum price for nuclear electricity. I say four points, but actually this seemed to me like three mice and one elephant. I asked him if, by a guaranteed minimum price, he meant subsidies. He said no, he didn't. I asked him what the difference was. He couldn't explain in a way which made sense. And, indeed, for the government to guarantee a minimum price for nuclear electricity over the 40-odd year lifespan of a nuclear power station appears to differ from a \"subsidy\" only in a semantic sense. Just to be clear, then - what the now mainly private nuclear industry is seeking is a 40-year deal with a government whose term expires in four years by which if it can generate electricity at a profit, it keeps the profit, but if it generates electricity at a loss, the public makes up the difference. How good does a nuclear future sound now? About as good as the Common Agricultural Policy, with which it has much in common. Let's be fair. It's unlikely that nuclear reactors would be subsidised directly by the Treasury. They would be subsidised directly by us when we pay our electricity bills. A nuclear tax would be hidden in the bill. The nuclear lobby would argue that there is already a renewable energy tax concealed in electricity bills. This is quite true. Electricity suppliers pass on to you and me and businesses the extra cost to them of buying electricity they're obliged to buy from wind farms and other renewable sources. The government would simply add a \"nuclear obligation\" to the existing renewables obligation. But there's a difference. Wind power is becoming steadily cheaper, after less than a decade of its widespread use. The downward curve of cost has become so embarrassingly steep that the anti-wind lobby now has a new stick to beat wind farms with. Embarrassing - but also a positive sign for the wind lobby that it is heading for the point where it could become commercially competitive without any subsidies. After a half-century of development and experience, the nuclear industry is nowhere near such a steep success curve. Why hand it another half-century of subsidies when the first 50 years didn't work? No-one should be under any illusions that wind and tidal power by themselves, vital as they are, let alone wave, biofuels and solar energy, are going to solve Britain's energy and pollution problems in the next two generations, and the country seems to be institutionally and psychologically incapable of taking the straightforward steps required to speed up energy efficiency and microgeneration. But this government does seem to be curiously anti-clean coal; and in the coming debate on nuclear, let those who believe it's safe and good for the planet please not pretend that it is anything other than an expensive alternative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2006/sep/16/hotels.ecotourism.travelsenvironmentalimpact","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-16T14:33:37Z","webTitle":"The new generation of hoteliers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/sep/16/hotels.ecotourism.travelsenvironmentalimpact","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2006/sep/16/hotels.ecotourism.travelsenvironmentalimpact","fields":{"headline":"The new generation of hoteliers","bodyText":"Once upon a time, hoteliers were a distinct breed.

Until now, scientists had assumed that meteorite dust trails consist mostly of nanometre-sized particles, but the new data shows that micrometre sized-particles dominate. Because these particles are a similar width to the wavelength of sunlight they are likely to interfere with sunlight as it travels towards the Earth. \"For the meteorite we measured, around 10% of the incident solar energy was scattered and absorbed by the dust cloud,\" says Klekociuk. If the meteorite is big enough, the scientists believe that the dust trail will have a similar effect on our climate to a large volcano."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2006/feb/16/europeanunion.utilities","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2006-02-16T09:32:58Z","webTitle":"Generation gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/feb/16/europeanunion.utilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2006/feb/16/europeanunion.utilities","fields":{"headline":"Generation gap","bodyText":"Tony Blair has received support from a top European executive for an ambitious EU energy plan to meet the challenges of high oil prices, secure supplies and climate change. Gérard Mestrallet, the chief executive of the French energy group, Suez, says the EU should invest €1,000bn (£682.7bn) in new unified grids for both electricity and gas transmission under a common energy policy. Mr Mestrallet's comments come ahead of next month's EU spring summit to discuss a European commission paper on the contentious roles of renewables and nuclear power within Europe's energy supply. The summit will also discuss how the EU's 25 national regulators can create the right policy framework for private sector investment. It is expected to endorse the common grid concept. Meanwhile, Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, is today set to warn governments and energy groups in several big countries that they face sanctions after their failure to open up their energy markets in time for full-scale liberalisation in July next year. But Mr Mestrallet said last week: \"Opening markets to competition is not enough, and Europe has not thought enough about long-term security of supply, and the need for investment in new production facilities and sources of energy and transmission infrastructures.\" With EU energy consumption expected to rise by 15%, including a 50% leap in electricity use, by 2030 when imports amount to 70% of the primary market, the Suez chief said Europe would require an extra 750 gigawatts (billion watts) of power plants or 1,500 new stations - at an estimated cost, according to the International Energy Agency, of € 650bn. In addition, electricity grids would have to be upgraded to prevent the current bottlenecks, which led to power blackouts in Italy in 2003, and to create a genuine single market. This would cost an additional €100bn. With 45% of EU natural gas already coming from Russia, an increasingly fractious supplier, the EU would need to spend €155bn on new production facilities and a further €100bn on developing a common grid - and on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities to ease imports from other countries such as Algeria and Qatar. Suez, Europe's fifth-largest provider of gas and electricity, acquired the Belgian operator Electrabel last year and runs Europe's largest LNG terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, on the North Sea coast - home to the gas interconnector (pipeline) with Britain in which it holds a 16% stake. Mr Mestrallet said: \"Europe is fragile and so is its electricity supply system ... Europe's own hydrocarbon reserves will run out in ten to 15 years and it has invested almost nothing in new generating capacity. If we don't wake up Europe will have one of the highest dependencies on imports of energy in the world, facing permanently high prices.\" Creating unified electricity and gas grids does not require large-scale state intervention, Mr Mestrallet argues, and can be financed entirely by the private sector without a penny of public funding - provided the 25 national regulators act in common. \"These grids are natural monopolies and the regulator(s) have to give the correct signal. One can dream of coordinated activities by the regulators which would spur Europe's need for a modern infrastructure with a proper reward for capital and tariffs,\" he said, calling for a single regulator. Suez, which has 58,000 megawatt of capacity globally, including two nuclear power stations in Belgium it acquired via Electrabel, believes Europe cannot survive without the nuclear option. It is a supplier to the third generation European Pressurised Reactor being built by the French manufacturer Areva in Finland. Mr Mestrallet said: \"It is up to each country to decide but collectively it's a solution which can't be avoided. Nuclear has to have a place in Europe's energy mix to combat global warming.\" His group is considering plans to build its own pressurized reactor in France or to join forces, as a minority partner, with part-privatised energy company EDF to build a series there. But he is less sanguine about the prospects for renewables, despite his group's investment in hydropower as well as wind power, biomass and solar energy, and a target of 18% of installed capacity by the end of the decade. The group, which delivered a cargo of LNG to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent last autumn to help ease the then UK shortage of gas, has dismissed as pointless the current inquiry by Ofgem, the British energy regulator, into the alleged failings of the interconnector. Executives argue flows under the Channel were normal and, anyway, Suez had long-term contracts with continental purchasers it had to meet. Alain Janssens, the chief executive of Distrigas Suez, which holds the interconnector stake, points out capacity has been doubled to 16.5bn cubic metres of gas, and will be upgraded by the end of this year to 23bn. The executives argue that Britain, which reported its first trade deficit in hydrocarbons (€96bn) last week for 26 years, miscalculated the speed at which North Sea reserves were being depleted - and failed to secure enough long-term contracts or invest in adequate gas storage. For Mr Mestrallet the UK is a no-go area for large-scale acquisition of the kind being considered by energy groups such as Russia's Gazprom. He insists that Suez is opting for organic growth, notably by expanding its LNG terminal at Everett, Massachusetts, the biggest US importer, and will only contemplate smaller acquisitions in, say, France and Belgium - despite the urgings of some of his advisers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2005/aug/20/highereducation.biography","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2005-08-20T00:03:17Z","webTitle":"Review: Mary Archer by Margaret Crick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/aug/20/highereducation.biography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2005/aug/20/highereducation.biography","fields":{"headline":"Archer & Archer","bodyText":"Mary Archer: For Richer, For Poorer by Margaret Crick 352pp, Simon &amp;amp;amp; Schuster, £17.99 For some time now, Mary Archer's reputation has been on the whiffy side. If there was once, in the era of her fragrance, a possibility that this sanctimonious academic was quite as much a victim of her husband Jeffrey Archer's misdeeds as the prostitute Monica Coghlan and the many other people he has deceived, threatened or paid off, it has since been thoroughly extinguished by her subsequent adventures as an Anglia director, Lloyd's council member, merciless litigant and, above all, as champion of the Old Vicarage One. Anyone who can insist, as Mary Archer still does, that her husband did not deserve his prison sentence for the \"trivial\" crime of perverting justice is either dim or morally flawed, or, I suppose, in the pay of Jeffrey Archer. And the choirmistress Mary Archer is certainly not dim. Whiffiness, as Jeffrey Archer demonstrated for very many years, is no barrier to preferment, and his wife continues to prosper in public life. Although her work in solar energy is not, one gathers from Margaret Crick's biography, of a quality to put her in the first rank of scientists, Mrs Archer has nonetheless collected a number of prominent positions on boards and bodies, trusts and charities that would be quite amazing, were it not in the nature of such activities to be insupportably boring. Although it may be disagreeable for fellow worthies on, for instance, the board of Addenbrooke's NHS Trust, to endure sustained contact with a person who must be irreparably grubbied by her years as Jeffrey Archer's helpmeet, there is no evidence from Crick (who certainly looked hard for it) that the female Archer has been anything other than efficient and diligent in her public duties. And for all one knows, Lady Archer, who was heard not long ago hissing \"bitch\" at her former secretary in the high court, may, in this world of status-seeking busybodies, pass for a person of untrammelled integrity. What preoccupies Crick is her clever subject's loyalty to that buffoon, philanderer and fraud, Jeffrey. \"Does she know about everything and simply accept it? Does she excuse Jeffrey's unacceptable behaviour because she feels he has many redeeming features?\" Crick asks. \"Or is she a very strong wife who values loyalty and her marriage vows very highly?\" Would it really add to the sum of human knowledge if Mary told us the answer? Of course, Crick thinks so, worrying away at the question for well over 300 well-upholstered pages, until she is forced, in the final chapter, to admit that Mary remains \"an enigma ... largely because she stays married to Jeffrey\". In putting such emphasis on this mystery, Crick does herself a disservice, for her main achievement is to highlight, as never before, the similarities between the Archers. Mary may be a mistress of the periodic table who reeks of moral certitude, but she is also a flagrant exhibitionist who will grab any opportunity to warble and prance in front of an audience and who takes obvious delight in the attention and wealth, property and parties, geegaws and dressing-up opportunities that have been conferred on her through her husband's efforts. A career in solar energy does not buy country vicarages, penthouses and art collections. As with Cherie Blair, with whom she also has quite a bit in common, it is a habit of Archer's to alternate between showing off and asserting her right to privacy, and she seems to have gone to some trouble to thwart Crick in her research. While one fully understands Crick's irritation, Archer's resistance is also comprehensible. For there is, obviously, a good deal of difference between offering your own, disingenuous confessions and having them extracted from you willy-nilly by a third, probably unsympathetic party. Coming from the wife of Michael Crick, the author of a brilliant and brave exposé of Lord Archer's deceptions, Stranger than Fiction, this proposal for a companion volume was never likely to appeal to Mary Archer. Whichever came first, Margaret's antipathy, or Mary's obstructiveness, the result is a study in hostility. For example, Mary is semi-ridiculed for appearing in a new \"eyecatching designer outfit\", and then twitted for greeting Jeffrey, on his return from prison, in a dress \"at least six years old\". She is charged with having a face lift, then rebuked for wanting to keep it a secret. She is chastised for occasionally lashing out, and then criticised for not doing so more often. The snitty asides, sustained over so many pages, are not just monotonous, they also have the occasional, quite unintended effect of evoking sympathy. Whatever the couple's private sexual arrangements, for example, it seems unlikely that Jeffrey Archer's many infidelities were painless for his wife. Crick, perhaps working on the assumption that anyone married to Jeffrey Archer cannot have feelings, introduces the subject as follows: \"Unfortunately for Mary, one person certainly finding time to squeeze in a few extramarital affairs was the husband she liked so much.\" With this level of disaffection, it must have been hell for Crick to complete what reads, for all her obvious research, like a protracted cuts job, supplemented with great chunks of Jeffreyana and lacings of Christmas round-robin detail (\"guests enjoyed a menu of 'ham mousse and Newnham soufflé'\"). Actually, the great enigma of this book is not the mysterious bond between Archer and Archer, but what, exactly, Crick ever thought she saw in Mary. ·To order Mary Archer for £16.99 with free UK p&amp;amp;amp;p call Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875. www.theguardian.com/bookshop"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2006/jul/17/architecture.watersportsholidays","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2006-07-17T09:45:35Z","webTitle":"Steve Rose: on lidos in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jul/17/architecture.watersportsholidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2006/jul/17/architecture.watersportsholidays","fields":{"headline":"Just add water","bodyText":"It has been argued that human beings love the water because we evolved from a species of aquatic ape, but if you look at the state of Britain's swimming pools, you wonder if we're now heading in the opposite direction. Having spent the past few centuries developing ever more sophisticated monuments to aquatic recreation, swimming pool architecture seems to be in a state of regression. The scenario today's swimmers are most likely to experience is a lukewarm bath of chemicals and urine in a humid 1970s leisure centre - possibly the closest mankind has come to recreating the primordial soup. Swimming architecture in Britain reached its evolutionary peak in the 1930s and 40s. This was the golden age of the lido, an era to which older swimmers look back with nostalgia and younger ones with envy. The word itself (derived from the bathing resort just off Venice) conjures images of something more exotic than a utilitarian swimming pool (\"machines for swimming in\", as Iris Murdoch, who preferred rivers, described them). The prospect of being able to swim outdoors, lie in the sun and generally reconnect with our inner aquatic ape was appealing enough to interwar Britons, but lidos were also places to commune. They were an environment outside the ordinary rules of society, where physiques could be safely displayed and appraised, and where the mixing of the gene pool was a distinct possibility. Package holidays, council cutbacks and maintenance headaches have all added to the demise of the British lido, and out of the 300-odd lidos and outdoor pools in operation before the second world war, only about 100 are still open. But the functions they fulfilled can hardly be said to have gone out of fashion, and in recent years a growing grassroots community - including architectural conservationists, hardcore bathers and ecologically responsible leisure-seekers - has mobilised to stop the lido going the way of the dodo. And they've been making considerable progress. A number of derelict lidos around the country have been successfully reinstated in recent years, such as those in Plymouth, Penzance and Brighton. Others, in Uxbridge, Brockwell Park, Broomhill in Ipswich, have been brought back from the brink of extinction, thanks to new refurbishment contracts. Putatively leading the current renaissance is Hackney's London Fields Lido, which closed in 1984 and has been undergoing a £3m renovation. As well as restoring the facility to its former glory, the scheme aims to put a removable roof over the pool, to allow for winter swimming. But although the lido was due to re-open this month, the date has now been put back till October - due, among other things, to the discovery of large quantities of asbestos in the buildings. As much as some lido lobbyists would like to see every pool restored to its prime, the London Fields Lido serves as a reminder that most lidos were not necessarily built to last. Lidos were very much an early 20th-century craze, and as a result they were frequently thrown up quickly, using cheap labour, in the interests of political gain. Most were built by local authorities, and overseen by engineers rather than architects. Consequently, their styles vary wildly, as Janet Smith's comprehensive book Liquid Assets, published by English Heritage, attests. Some look like adapted cricket pavilions, others like neo-classical temples or art deco palaces. But above all, lidos were a place where racy new European modernism found a safe haven. Mendelsohn and Chermayeff's celebrated De La Warr Pavilion, in Bexhill-on-Sea, introduced Britain to seaside modernism in 1935, and its nautical influence is clearly visible in Brighton's Saltdean Lido, with its flat roofs, curvilinear facades and ship-like railings, built three years later. Lidos produced other striking structures, not least Weston-super-Mare's diving platform. An evocative, extravagant tower built upon two reinforced concrete arches, its swooping lines and slender cantilevers somehow summed up the spirit of the age, but it was demolished in 1982. In London, architects Rowbotham and Smithson produced a run of handsome deco lidos typically composed of harmoniously proportioned brick boxes, which could almost have come off the drawing board of Frank Lloyd Wright. Many are still running, including those at Brockwell Park and Parliament Hill Fields. Some of Britain's grandest lidos are lost forever, such as the stupendous Super Swimming Stadium in Morecambe, which held Esther Williams-style swimming revues and weekly heats of the Miss Great Britain contest. Or Blackpool's Open Air Baths, a lavish beaux arts-style swimming temple the size of a football stadium, complete with a domed main pavilion and a pergola-shaded rooftop cafe. Or the colossal New Brighton Bathing Pool, which attracted more than a million swimmers in 1934. At the time, these were some of the largest pools in the world, but they were frequently structurally unsound and built on unsustainable visitor numbers, destined to become the dinosaurs of the lido world. If you look beyond lidos, there are contemporary alternatives for outdoor communal swimming. The idea of a floating lido, for example, has been repeatedly explored. Such a facility existed on the Thames in the 19th century (although it was essentially just a closed-off portion of the river); artist Tracey Emin has expressed a desire to design one; and 10 years ago architect Alex Lifschutz proposed an Olympic-sized floating pool for the Coin Street estate, to be moored off the South Bank. With a glass-sided swimming tank, poolside restaurants, and a transparent roof that would collect solar energy to heat the pool water, it was a tantalising prospect, but the economics didn't pan out, Lifschutz explains. \"It was too expensive, even if funded by the restaurants around it. We've now got a site on land [on Doon Street], and we've just put in a planning application for a swimming pool and sports centre of a more conventional size, but funded by a 40-odd storey tower. There's an understanding now of the huge economic burden of a swimming pool, and we need the housing to subsidise that.\" While the funding of lidos and public pools has been the subject of heated debate in Britain, a floating pool, the Piscine Josephine Baker, opened in Paris just last week (and promptly closed again, after it was found that tiles were coming loose from its base). On the whole, though, things are rosier for public swimmers in France. Home of the famed Piscine Molitor, the pool that arguably started the lido craze, Paris has more Olympic-sized swimming pools than the whole of Britain put together. In reality, the Piscine Josephine Baker is more of a swimming pool barge hugging the bank of the Seine, but it could prove to be a new solution for public bathing. \"It has a sliding roof, and you can also open the facade towards the river, so when you're swimming in the pool you have the impression you're swimming in the Seine,\" says its architect, Robert de Busni. \"And in a way you are, because it's the same water. The pool takes it from the river and treats it, then we give it back to the Seine more pure than when we took it out.\" The pool was a challenge to design and build, according to de Busni, since it combines conventional and naval architecture. In order to get it to its location in the 13th arrondissement, it had to be designed in pieces and assembled on site, with the result that it can be taken apart \"like Lego\" and rebuilt somewhere else, says de Busni. \"We can put it anywhere. We can take it to London if you like.\" Another promising new branch of pool design opened recently in Gloucestershire: a commercial eco pool. Domestic eco pools have been around for a few years, but this one is part of a luxury health \"artspa\" at the Lower Mill Estate - a sort of Hamptons-style second-home complex-cum-nature reserve near Cirencester. Rather than treating the water with chlorine and other chemicals, eco pools use reed beds to clean it naturally, and the water flows like a slow river, preventing the build-up of algae and debris. As a result, they're not only more environmentally sound than conventional pools, they're also friendly to wildlife. \"I have this sort of ridiculous notion of Swallows and Amazons, and swimming in rivers and ponds as a kid, and it just appealed to me, the idea of having a swimming river,\" says Jeremy Paxton, Lower Mill Estate's developer. \"It's a fabulous habitat - we get swallows and housemartins and dragonflies, we even had a kingfisher come by the other day.\" Paxton is already planning a whole village based around a much larger eco pool, which residents will be able to dive into from their balconies. This exclusive fantasy world might be a long way from your average municipal pool, of course, but that's possibly the only context in which such ideas are ever likely to be realised. And once developed, there's no reason why eco pools couldn't work in the public realm. Paxton estimates his cost 25% less to build than a conventional domestic swimming pool. \"I'm of a vintage where lidos existed and I loved them,\" he says. \"It would be fabulous to see a proper public lido heated by solar and wind power, filled by rainwater run-off, full of wildlife. Could it work? Absolutely.\" A public eco lido in every town might be some way off, but it's a persuasive idea, less primordial soup than garden of Eden. Perhaps such ideas run counter to the concerns of the lido conservationists, but there is room for alternatives; a return to our primal state, underpinned by the sustainable technology of the future, could be the next evolutionary step for aquatic apes everywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2005/dec/21/worldcup2006travelguide5","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2005-12-21T19:10:21Z","webTitle":"Dortmund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/dec/21/worldcup2006travelguide5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2005/dec/21/worldcup2006travelguide5","fields":{"headline":"Dortmund","bodyText":"The largest city of the Ruhr region, Dortmund was formerly a coal mining and steel producing centre.

Little more than two decades ago, researchers were astonished to find the first communities flourishing at such depths, deriving their energy from the heat from hydrothermal vents. Now, 2,400 metres under the Pacific, off Mexico, Thomas Beatty of the University of British Columbia and colleagues have found a bacterium that makes a living off the imperceptible light provided by gushers of water emerging at 350C into the almost freezing ocean waters. Sunlight can penetrate as far as 200m, getting ever more faint with depth. But the researchers found a sulphur-eating photosynthetic organism in samples taken near a vent more than 10 times as deep. Since the creature could not possibly harvest sunlight at that depth, it must be getting light energy from another source, they report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That source could only be the very faint glow of very hot water. The discovery has implications for the search for life beyond Earth - perhaps in the liquid ocean thought to slosh beneath the thick ice of Jupiter's moon Europa or in some aquifer on Mars. \"Life finds a way,\" says Robert Blankenship of Arizona State University, one of the team. \"This shows that photosynthesis is something that is not limited only to the very surface of our planet.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2006/oct/05/todaysletters","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2006-10-05T07:11:58Z","webTitle":"Today's letters in full","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2006/oct/05/todaysletters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2006/oct/05/todaysletters","fields":{"headline":"Today's letters in full","bodyText":"We receive far more letters than we can print on paper. So here's what we chose from, in full.. STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION \"Energy... in the average human step, roughly eight watts\" (A step in the right direction, 28/9). Oh dear. Confusing power (energy per second, measured in Watts) and energy (measured in Joules) is, sadly, all too common. Any chance we could have a version of that interesting article edited by a physicist? The number of Joules per step would start to give an indication of what might be possible with this technology. Tom Ward, Norwich Following the problem with volts and power from last week I note that you have again a problem with power and energy: A step in the right direction by Danny Bradbury , Technology p1-2. I col.1 it says '...captured some of the energy discharged in the average human step, roughly eight watts, ...'.In col.2 there is '...five to eight watts could be recovered from each footfall, ...'. On p2 col.1 again 'You can convert about 3-6W per step' and 'There are many kilowatts of energy that we could be harvesting ...'. (Could we see Claire Price's calculations on how to power around 6.5million LED lights?) Like many other articles in the Guardian (and energy is now a matter frequently written about) you do not seem to appreciate the difference between energy and power. Power, in these cases measured in watt, is a rate given by energy (in Joule) per second. For example, a high power laser can generate a power of say 1 Terawatt (probably more than is needed to power the whole of the UK) but since this may last for a picosecond the amount of energy expended is only 1 Joule. If for example a 2kw kettle takes 3minutes to boil the energy input is 360000J. Energy is what is required to do useful work and is what you pay for to the gas and electricity companies. Look at your electricity meter and you will see that it reads kilowatt-hour. And by the way, what does the 'bigger power kick' at the end of the article mean? Is it some form of kung-fu movement? If all this energy is to be 'harvested' where do you think it comes from? The principle of conservation of energy is still one of the foundation stones of physics. It can only come from the person walking so you will be expending more energy in walking than you would in normal circumstances and people would tire more quickly. Thus only useful for those keen on exercising more. Sounds like a pretty unattractive proposition to me, and I hope Trevor Bayliss was not wearing such shoes in his trek across the desert in Namibia. Not the place to out in the midday sun. And as for the wobbly bridge, the more energy you extract from it the more it will be damped and consequently the energy output would be reduced i.e. it would just be an electromagnetic form of damping. Dr Scott Hamilton, Cheadle, Cheshire I was interested to read Danny Bradbury's piece on activity generated power, \"A step in the right direction\". Just one thing concerned me. The strap line stated that scientists were doing it all, yet the article was clearly describing the work of engineers. The fact that your \"technology\" section doesn't know the difference between scientists and engineers is something you seem to share with a large slice of the UK population. I'm an engineer and NOT a scientist. The engineering profession is the largest profession in the country. Scientists are a smaller but just as prestigeous profession. There are both Chartered Engineers and Chartered Scientists. Our activities are closely related, and sometimes overlap, but they are not the same thing. This general lack of understanding, is one of the reasons why it is becoming more difficult to recruit to both engineering and science degree courses, with the consequent shortages accross many industries. Perhaps an article illustrating the differences would help. Colin Ledsome, London '8 Watts per step'? '3-6 Watt per step'? Dudes! What makes it even worse is that you get it right elswhere: 'A typist can generate 19 milliwatts'. The watt is a rate unit, similar to speed (Watts are Joules per second, speed is meters per second). 'Watts per step' is sheer luddite nonsense. I expect I'm not the first to point this out, and I most certainly won't be the last. Prepare yourself for the deluge! Glenys Williams-Hesse, Wantage Danny Bradbury's \"A step in the right direction\" repeatedly refers to energy as measured in watts. The watt is a measure of power. The measure for energy would be, for example, watt hours. Perhaps a technically competent person should be hired as proof reader for the Technology area of The Guardian. Or do you rely entirely on spelling checkers ? Interesting article otherwise, but wouldn't it be more effective to wear a piezoelectric chest strap under your singlet or pyjama top ? Keep the lungs well exercised, too. From one who once worked with hot metal typesetting, Neville Holmes, Dilston, Tasmania I have never understood why, in the way bicycles create their own lighting, the wheels on trains which just bogie (i.e. those which are not drive wheels) cannot be used to provide power for lighting and air conditioning. Georgeanne Slater, London Reading your article reminded me that the Spanish government recently passed a law for all new buildings and houses to have solar panels installed on their roofs, a great idea since we receive so much solar energy thought the year, so might as well use the sun to cut down on conventional electrical sources. Jorge, Spain [no other details given] VISTA VS ANTIVIRUS COMPANIES Microsoft IS trying to make money by improving security measures. Microsoft's OS is full of security flaws, and every security hole has a much higher chance of being exploited because the Microsoft OS is the most widely used OS. Because of these security holes a larger number of people are switching over to other OSes. It is also why Mozilla Firefox is also gaining a larger and larger user base. In fact, Firefox has been found to contain more holes and errors than Microsoft IE- and yet Firefox still gains a larger base of users because its flaws are less exploited. It is easy to extrapolate that if Microsoft does not fix these holes then they will lose customers- and thus money. Thus they make A LOT of money by even trying to fix the security flaws. And even more when you quote them saying they are doing ti simply to insure customer safety. Sohail Anwar, New York City &gt;&gt; One can easily see how Symantec might consider this \"confusing for customers.\" Before, they had one easy, clear choice: re-up their subscription or have no protection. Now they have choices, and that can be so confusing. I can certainly see why Symantec might dislike a change in Windows Vista that stops them from disabling WSC and, incidentially, ensures customers can easily find several choices for protection. http://blogs.technet.com/security/default.aspx CLICKPRINTS &gt;&gt; This is bogus. Even if they can often distinguish between me and another anonymous person, it wont be 100% correct. I don't want to be considered for fraud under my own cards. http://www.driverheaven.net/showthread.php?t=119669 SETH FINKELSTEIN &gt;&gt; On the mailing list WikiEN-L, Steve Summit identifies a law of Wikipedia that should become known as the Finkelstein Paradox -- a subject who argues he doesn't belong in Wikipedia is more likely to remain in Wikipedia. http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/3031/want-out-wikipedia-fight-stay CHIP AND FRENCH PIN Interesting article but Kate's experiences with French petrol pumps were caused by a different sort of problem. As far as I know these pumps currently only take French credit cards, not UK ones. They've had chip and pin for a lot longer than we have but I've also found that some restaurants etc still require a signature, not a PIN, for UK cards. Colin Blakemore, London ION TURNTABLE (CONT'D) May I assure Barbara Robinson (Letters, 28 September) that I am not sniffy about the Ion turntable? I am sure it is an excellent product. What I am sniffy about is Ashley Norris's claim (14 September) that other methods of transferring LPs to CD are 'for the most part ...not very effective'. Allan Jones, Yardley Gobion, Northamptonshire INKJET PRINTERS (CONT'D) About the time of your piece on inkjet cartridges on 14 September my printer gave up the ghost, and reassured that I would still be able to buy cheap cloned cartridges I replaced my Epson inkjet with another Epson. However when today I went to Cartridgemonkey for cartridges for the new printer I found a grovelling page of praise for genuine Epson cartridges but no sign of cheap clones any more. Did Epson read your article and fly into a rage? Penny Munday, Havant \"Epson people are no fools\" (Letters, September 21)? Well, they have a foolish approach to customers, which gives them no long term future. My experience with their C80 printer means I will never buy another Epson printer. The drawbacks include very expensive ink cartridges, which are not accepted by recyclers for refilling. A fixed print head makes servicing difficult and expensive. The printer wastes lots of ink every time it is switched on - see http://www2.shopping.com/xPR-Epson_Stylus_C80~RD-65809583748. The print nozzles block easily when printer not used ( e.g. you go away on holiday) and are very difficult to unblock. See http://www.gatago.com/comp/periphs/printers/4063985.html . Never again! David J Jones, Knutsford RIM/BLACKBERRY I understand that RIM/Blackberry has disrupted its service to many of its existing customers in the process of switching them to a new server. Vodafone has told me that this could take till Oct 16th till it is completed. This was done with absolutely no warning and left many people – including me – wondering why the service had suddenly ceased. I'm appalled at the way RIM have behaved – is it a coincidence that this happened at the same time as they announced their results? They deserve negative publicity for this, and I hope you'll give them some. Steven Burkeman, York UBUNTU 28th September 2006 - Clinton speaks to the Labour conference, behind him a sign highlighting ubuntu ... is this the first time a Linux distribution has featured in a Steve Bell cartoon ? Mike Whittaker, Stapleton, Shropshire ROADWORKS DATABASE The article written by Michael Cross and published in \"Technology Guardian\" on 21 September 2006 is a welcome discussion on the subject of buried apparatus in our road structure, however having Chaired the Institution of Civil Engineers/ Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors Buried Services Working Group (BSWG) there are a number of points that require clarification. * The suggestion that some prodding from government was required to create the National Underground Assets Group is incorrect. NUAG was formed as a direct result of the BSWG report published in February 2005 and not by any form of prodding from government. It should be noted that the Department for Transport have been very supportive of the efforts of the BSWG and NUAG but they have not attempted to influence either group. * There is a suggestion that a code of practice for buried assets is a new concept and that government need some form of persuasion to accept such a document, both of which are incorrect. The National Joint Utilities Group (NJUG) produced a Code of practice some time ago and has been accepted by all concerned, including government, as the norm. The code of practice currently being developed is required by all concerned to meet the commercial needs of the industry and to meet the requirements of the Traffic Management Act (2004) and the Transport (Scotland) Act (2004). Through the good efforts of NUAG and the support of DfT the new code of practice will benefit all concerned and there is no need for lobbying. * The suggestion that the coordinated system provided in Scotland is more accurate that that available in England and Wales is incorrect. The confusion of differing formats and questionable accuracy of locational data is the same throughout the UK and in the main the rest of the world. The proposals of the BSWG report that are being developed by NUAG are innovative and could be applied overseas. * Areas of national security will apply to some buried assets but very few. In the main there will be a freedom of information on aspects of buried assets that could affect the general public as has been demonstrated with the EMPRESS and ELGIN projects. It must be remembered that the data relating to these assets is in itself an asset and the companies have the right to decide who has access and if there should be a rate applied to any details that are provided outwith legal requirements. We very much welcome the Guardian's efforts in bringing to light this critical aspect of Britain's road network and we trust the clarifications above make it clear that without the bold initiatives of GEB and the two associated Institutions, very little progress would have happened.

Here's the full set from which we chose those we printed.. FOLLOW YOU, FOLLOW ME Given today's article on GPS you may be interested in this mobile phone application which will allow most java enabled camera phones to link to a Bluetooth receiver to plot your journeys: www.locoblog.com Dr Paul Coulton, Lancaster University, Lancaster Tom Hibbard must be very confident that his 24 hour 7 day a week GPS location wont lead to his home being burgled. Councillor Sue Blatchford, Southampton City Council GPS phones are almost upon us? They are already! I bought a Motorola A780 some months ago with built in (ok, it came on a card) CoPilot Live for the UK and major European roads. I'd been waiting past all the TomToms, etc (that take up acreage on windscreens and leave tell-tale sucker-marks) for an all-in-one phone that didn't have to have a separate GPS receiver as some have. Motorola said that it hoped to build GPS into most or all of its future phones. I drive between private addresses all day and choose to rely on map software printouts for routes that I can change on the fly (Route 66 if you must know). My phone sits in my shirt pocket and guides me only by voice in new cities and in the countyside in the dark. It has its limitations but it does exactly what I need and takes photos, videos and soundclips - as if I need them!. I'd be happy to provide a brief review if needed but check out the Motorola website first to see its capabilities. I've no connections with anyone in the trade but can get one other phone for the £250.00 I paid for mine, SIM- and contract-free. I slotted in my ancient O2 SIM card and away it went. My field supervisor saw mine and bought himself one the next day. I've tested the GPS positioning with that shown on a screen on a cross-channel ferry and sat on trains and timed them at over 100mph - all on this phone. Sad, probably, but still interested in such new technology despite grey hairs. Peter W Skillern (no post town given) Thank you, Ronan Fitzgerald, for highlighting the promise and pitfalls of GPS tracking ('Follow you, follow me,' technology Guardian, 14.09.06). The article presented in a balanced way the pros and cons of this technology as on the hand GPS tracking can be used in a positive way, for example to assist the emergency services, but also has serious potential for abuse (eg employers tracking workers). I found the article incredibly thought-provoking and share Mr Fitzgerald's conclusion that consent is key: \"whether we're using our mobile phone, wandering around on social networking sites, or just going about our daily lives, we want to have agreed to any tracking that takes place\". Vicki Combe, Whitstable Lots of interesting possibilities for GPS location via mobile phones were canvassed in the \"Follow you, follow me\" article, Guardian 14/9/2006. The worrying possibilities such as tracking without consent would surely be mitigated if the GPS function in a phone could be turned off. But I suppose this wasn't mentioned because the story would have lost an essential journalistic ingredient, to scare. Be that as it may, one potential use of GPS in mobile phones that occurs to me would be in connection with calling taxis. The taxi driver could know where you are immediately. The passenger could also use it to track the journey to the destination. Chris Opie, Clifton Hill, Australia PRINTER CARTRIDGES (TECHNOBILE) What you say about printer cartridges is true, of course, but the Epson people are no fools. When I installed a Jettec cartridge ordered from Premier Ink Supplies (part of Q Enterprises UK Ltd), my new Epson Stylus C48 printer immediately detected that it was not an Epson-made cartridge, and after a warning, shut down completely. It took a good hour of fiddling, re-installing software, etc to get the thing working again after I put an Epson cartridge into it. Clearly there is now a bit in the printer that detects cloned cartridges. (name and address supplied) Andrew Brown's article \"Technobile\" (14th September) touched a raw nerve. I recently purchased a HP PSC1510 Printer Scanner Copier all in one for my iMac G5 in March. During a holiday in Kuala Lumpur this summer, I decided to buy a replacement cartridge as it was relatively cheaper. I made sure it was for the right machine When I got home to install the cartridge, I found it was not compatible. I contacted HP, who said that I should have read the small print on the printer box and cartridges that specified that the product was sale in that region only. This policy was designed to stop people importing cheap cartridges from abroad. It seems me to that HP possibly indulging in restrictive marketing practice. The company needs to grow up and acknowledge that it is a global village out there. I will not be purchasing HP printer products from now on. PS anyone want a relatively new PSC1510? Gary Choo, Keighley, West Yorkshire The piece by Andrew Brown (Sep14) on the Great Rip off by Printer Makers warmed my heart as it has been almost an obsession with me since I first bought my Canon bubblejet about 10years ago. I started refilling cartridges and did so until I got an Epson Printer and could buy Compatible cartridges which were as good as the originals. I have promoted their use whenever possible and even got Guardian Columnist Michele Hanson using them - to her great delight! All seemed well until fairly recently when Epson threatened to Prosecute Compatible Manufacturers for Infringement of Patent - this was because their Chipped Cartridges had failed to prevent Chipped Compatibles from being made and marketed. Whether there have been as yet, any successful prosecutions I do not know but at the last Computer Fair I attended I was told by one stallholder that there would be no more available form him very soon. It is because the threat of astronomical damages being awarded is a very real one and cannot be risked. If you remember, Robert Maxwell used a similar ploy successfully for many years! What can be done about it? Well if Original Manufacturers reduced their prices to economic levels we would all be happy. However as they expect the gravy train to run for ever and greed rules there is little likelihood of this so may I suggest that Compatible manufacturers refill 'original' cartridges. e.g.. \"Send us your cartridge and we'll refill it for you\" This cannot be any more illegal than changing the brand of petrol in your car tank! Incidentally, I did e-mail Jack Schofield on September 9, mentioning Ink Cartridges (when I asked him about another problem as well) but have had no reply or comment; in fact he seems to have disappeared from the reach of my PC. Charles Rowbotham, Arnside. Andrew Brown's \"Technobile\" today is one of the most useful things I have read for ages. More please. We need two things: some green or progressive entrepreneur shoul design and sell printers which can be filled from an ink bottle. They would quickly conquer the market. Some Dyson of the IT world. In the meantime you should publish a weekly table showing the capitalised cost of buying each available printer and its cartridges over a few years and the availability of generic/cloned/refillable cartridges. Compared with the massive data tables in other Guardian supplements (interest rates, university rankings) it would not be much work and it would be truly valuable to us all. Michael Edwards, London &gt;&gt; Do you know how much per sheet your printing costs you? I don't. Hewlett-Packard cartridges are apparently particularly poor value. What make of printer do I have? Hewlett-Packard. A twin pack Tri-colour cartridge costs £47 on their UK website; but in the States I could get the same item for $62.99 (about £34). And I can't even be sure I'm getting the same number of copies. Andrew Brown says: Their chips actually vary from country to country... Their current slogan is: HP Invent. Invent what: diferent ways to make you pay? http://aristophanes2006.blogspot.com/ NATIONAL ARCHIVES Michael Cross (14 September, p3) should know that the Family Record Centre is not where one goes to obtain wills (High Holborn for that) but the successor to Somerset House for Births, Marriages and Deaths, plus a sizable computerised facility for census and other data. It is central, accessible, busy and should be profitable, so therefore a clear target for the McKinsey-trained brain. Philip Ralph, Ivybridge GADGETS (Ion Turntable Ashley Norris writes 'There are many ways to transfer audio from vinyl records to PCs, but for the most part they are complex and not very effective,' (Technology 14 September). Whether these 'many ways' are effective depends on whether you know what you are doing, the quality of the software you use, and how much trouble you go to. The results can be extremely effective. The new Ion turntable is doubtless less complex than other ways, but I cannot imagine how it could be more effective, given that the editing software it uses is quite modest. Allan Jones, Yardley Gobion In your issue of 14-Sep you featured the Ion USB Turntable in the Gadgets column. The device is fine and the Audacity software is pretty good, if a little quirky.

SOLAR ENERGY Just emailing to point out an error in the paragraph \"Arnold Schwarzenegger (turning out to be the ideal politician, more interested in pragmatism than party politics) has initiated a scheme to put 3kW of photovoltaic capacity on 1m Californian rooves - to generate as much electricity as three power plants - in the next 10 years.\" The California Million Solar Roofs Bill really ought to result in more than 3kW of installed capacity. 3GW is closer to the mark for a programme costing USD 3bn and leveraging private finance. [The sentence was meant to imply \"on *each* of 1m rooves - Technology Ed.] I'm also dubious about the assertion in the article that the biggest silicon manufacturing plants are in China (though Scandinavia is correct). China is a huge manufacturer of solar modules and cells, but it imported nearly all its silicon in 2006 from the West. For example, Chinese cell manufacturer Suntech just signed a 10-year silicon wafer supply contract with US semiconductor manufacturer, MEMC Electronic Materials. This may well change in the next few years as companies like Tianwei Yingli and the Jinglong Group intend to expand feedstock capacity significantly. Jenny Chase, Senior Analyst, New Energy Finance magazine BROADBAND With all the buzz about broadband and the faster speeds being rolled out, I think people's attention should be drawn to a rather unpleasant fact. A network is only as fast as its slowest link. In this case it's the local loop. BT are busy spending money on 21CN, but this is their backbone and will have little effect for consumers. They are doing nothing about the local loop. This has serious consequences for broadband which is very sensitive to the length and quality of the line from people's homes to the exchange. BT are only required to provide a voice service. They push broadband very hard with ads proclaiming \"up to 8Mps\", but the reality is very different. If you are on a line which is either very long or of poor quality (not the same thing), then you are basically left to rot. As long as you can just about hear someone speaking to you at the end of the damp piece of string, BT refuse point blank to do anything at all to investigate concerns about line quality which causes poor ADSL performance. Nor are they required to do so. I could go into much more painful detail. Suffice to say, that until a regulator forces BT to change its ways, many of us are going to be left behind on poor connections which BT is under no obligation to do anything about. Given the lack of competition, they have very little incentive from a commercial point of view, either. Switching to a cable operator isn't a good choice for me right now, but that may change.

What has the home secretary done to deserve such an accolade? He took the train to Brussels. Once. Wow! It might not sound much, but it's a whole lot better than his ministerial colleagues. The Liberal Democrats' green spokesman, Norman Baker, has examined the details of ministerial travel, released in the summer. Of 42 official trips to Brussels from April 2004 to March 2005, a carbon-heavy 41 were made by air. Clarke was the only one to let the Eurostar take the strain. Zero rated When Tony Blair opened the ambitious CIS solar tower in the centre of Manchester last week he was full of praise for solar energy. Little did he know that the Department of Trade and Industry would, just 48 hours later, close the book on all community solar and other micro-renewable projects. Schools, village halls and others wanting support for solar hot water, or for wind power, will now have to wait at least six months until the next (smaller) round of grants becomes available. On the other hand, everyone can take comfort from the government's exhortations to China to invest more in zero-carbon and low-carbon technologies. Wailing for whales Even as Norway's \"scientific\" whaling season closes, with 639 minke whales killed, the Japanese fleet has waved two fingers to the world and set off to the southern ocean to kill 935. If this were not enough to enrage hundreds of environment and animal groups, Japan says it intends also to kill 10 endangered fin whales this year in what it called \"feasibility\" research. This will be upped next year to 50, along with 50 even more endangered humpback whales. The Australian government - no slouch in the past when it came to whaling - is furious. \"This is more than science - these are commercial quantities of whales,\" says Ian Campbell, the minister for the environment. Fat chance It beats flipping burgers, but only just. The University of Portsmouth is looking for a graduate to help its civil engineers tackle the fatty waste poured into the sewers by fast-food joints. Water companies spend £25m each year treating problems caused when restaurants tip hot fat down the sink. The lucky PhD candidate will spend time at Petersfield sewage works looking at ways to unclog the pipes, and will be given \"special training to deal with working in confined spaces\". Claustrophobics need not apply. Cross purposes Six months ago, a betting man might have put money on Transport for London powering through approval for its £500m Thames gateway bridge. But the odds may have shortened last week when the inquiry heard that the 2001 traffic figures on which TfL's case was based are wildly out. New TfL research demanded by Bexley, an objecting council, shows that traffic in many places likely to be affected has more than doubled in four years, suggesting there will be more pollution and congestion if the bridge is built. Friends of the Earth, Transport 2000 and locals say they are outraged. Tfl is having to rethink. Abandon ship BNFL has long admitted that even its own experts don't know what is in its noxious fuel storage ponds at Sellafield, but they can now be sure about one piece of nuclear waste rotting away down there: a submarine. In an inspired move that could slash years off the clean-up effort, BNFL's engineers sent the robot sub in to survey one of the ponds. Peering through the murky waters, it found some spent fuel, which was then dug out for storage - the first such retrieval for 15 years. The sub's reward? To be reclassified as nuclear waste. Now it can't come out again. Cor, slimy! A Greenpeace study last week found that European eels from 20 rivers and lakes in 10 countries contained residues of at least one brominated flame retardant (BFR) - nasty toxic manmade chemicals - and that the levels found in Thames eels were by far the highest. All of which spells bad news for the pearly kings and queens - those admirable cockneys who dress up in sequins and eat jellied eels. \"If they're poisonous, it would stop a lot of people eating them, and that wouldn't be on,\" says Carole Jolly, spokeswoman for the Pearly Society in London. \"They should stop using these chemicals. Eels are a very hardy fish, and if they're being affected, then everything will be affected.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2005/jun/12/climatechange.observerbusiness","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2005-06-12T01:06:43Z","webTitle":"Climate change is costing us, says BT boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/jun/12/climatechange.observerbusiness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2005/jun/12/climatechange.observerbusiness","fields":{"headline":"Climate change is costing us, says BT boss","bodyText":"The chief executive of BT has become the first boss of a British company to admit that climate change is already affecting his company, and that environmental damage could threaten the stability of the world's financial system. Talking exclusively to The Observer, BT boss Ben Verwaayen reveals that extreme weather in the form of flooding and high winds has hit BT's British operations, and he fears that this is just the beginning. He says: 'Since the beginning of the year, the media has been showing us images of Greenland glaciers crashing into the sea, Mount Kilimanjaro devoid of its ice cap and Scotland reeling from floods and gales. All down to natural weather cycles? I think not. 'The gales last winter followed Scotland's wettest summer on record. This meant we experienced numerous cable faults, overhead cables down and a whole car park full of vehicles ruined by floods.' Verwaayen added: 'There's no quick fix for climate change. However, we cannot afford to sit around waiting for it to really kick in before we act. By then it will be too late for many vulnerable people around the world and it could destabilise the world economy.' Last week, the world's most eminent scientific institutions - including the UK Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences - said unequivocally that significant global warming is real and there is little doubt that human activities are behind it. Carbon dioxide levels are now higher than they have been for the last 420,000 years and have risen by 34 per cent since 1750, they reckon. At a meeting with Tony Blair last week, BT joined forces with leaders from more than 20 other multinational businesses including BP, HP, Ford, HSBC, Toyota and Cisco to call on G8 governments to take action on climate change. Verwaayen said: 'We are not calling for knee-jerk reactions, but for a planned approach to tackling the issue. This is a long-term problem needing a long-term solution.'

A gas plant is slowly rising from the ground, already dwarfing the two-storey wooden houses in a town centre where reindeer often roam the streets. From next year, this place will process gas from an offshore field 90 miles north, deep under the Barents Sea. Norway believes that projects like this hold the solution to the current energy crisis. The thinking is that if the world is consuming increasing amounts of oil and gas, then more must be found. But Norway's approach is only one of four different strategies chosen by the Nordic countries. Sweden, Iceland and Finland have their own solutions. They, like all industrialised nations, are trying to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming while trying to supply enough energy. While Norway believes the answer is continuing reliance on fossil fuels, Sweden is attempting to become the first advanced economy that is fossil fuel free. Iceland is already the most energy efficient in the world, harnessing its unique energy resources. And, to the east, Finland is pressing the nuclear button, building the first reactor in western Europe for 15 years and the country's first in more than three decades. All this is taking place while Britain ponders which path it should take. Gone are the golden days when the UK could rely on the North Sea to heat its homes and boil its kettles. It is already a net importer of oil, and will soon import most of its gas. In recent weeks, political leaders have voiced different views about what needs to be done, and next month the government will publish its review of Britain's energy situation. The Norwegian approach typifies the scramble] to find new fossil fuels. Thanks to the riches of the North Sea, Norway has become the world's third largest exporter of oil - making it one of the world's wealthiest economies. It exports nearly all its fossil fuels. For domestic electricity for its 4.6 million people, the mountainous country relies on hydroelectric power. Changing fast But this situation is changing fast. Oil and gas from the North Sea are expected to run out within 30 years. So Norway is looking north, to the Arctic - a region that it is hoped holds a quarter of the world's untapped petroleum. The plant at Hammerfest is the first major Arctic project to see the light of day, and Norway hopes more will come. Oil companies have already drilled around 60 wells into fields under the Barents Sea, searching for oil and gas. \"There's an 80%-90% chance of hitting a dry well,\" says Oerjan Birkeland, a geologist for the Statoil petroleum company. \"But if you are successful, it's high value. So we are prepared to have dry wells.\" But this hunt for black gold has been extremely controversial. \"The Arctic is a huge ecosystem that groups a lot of smaller ones,\" says Frederic Hauge, head of the environmentalist group Bellona. \"It seems to be robust and that it can cope with many things, but because of global warming it faces dramatic changes. We are a nation of petroholics. We export fossil fuels that are equivalent, if burned, to 2.7% of global CO2 emissions.\" The controversy over Arctic exploration has even split the ruling coalition in Norway. When the Labour-led government opened new sections of the Barents Sea in March, no-go zones were established all along the northern coast as a result of pressure from its government partner, the Socialist Left. Since the Barents Sea is where Arctic cod spawns, there were concerns that petroleum exploitation would harm the profitable fisheries. Increased petroleum production is not helping Norway cut its CO2 emissions. The country spends a lot of money researching ways to get rid of excess CO2. Among the solutions proposed is injecting carbon dioxide under the North Sea, into the emptying oil and gas fields, thus preventing it from contaminating the atmosphere. Norway hopes the technique, which is also attracting interest from Britain, will even help squeeze more oil and gas out of the North Sea by increasing the pressure in the field and recovering more of its content. While Norway focuses on its fossil fuel riches, next door in Sweden things could not be more different. Last October, its government announced the most ambitious energy initiative by an advanced industrialised nation: attempting to wean itself off oil entirely within 15 years. \"A Sweden free of fossil fuels would give us enormous advantages, not least by reducing the impact from fluctuation in oil prices,\" argues Mona Sahlin, minister for sustainable development. Unlike Norway, Sweden has no oil or gas, and so must import both. Sahlin explains that the government's aim is that by 2020 \"no home will need oil for heating. By then, no motorist will be obliged to use petrol as the sole option available. By then, there will always be better alternatives to oil.\" A committee, led by the prime minster, Göran Persson, which includes scientists, business leaders and environmentalists, is investigating how the country can get rid of fossil fuels entirely. Sweden has cut its dependence on fossil fuels drastically since it peaked in the 1970s. For electricity, Swedes rely on nuclear and hydroelectric power. Alternative energy sources, such as geothermal energy or waste heat, are being encouraged. Fossil fuels, which account for 32% of Sweden's energy needs, are mainly used for transport. The oil committee is expected to unveil its proposals this month. Broadly, the strategy will be to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy and to improve energy efficiency, such as by encouraging people to use public transport. Stockholm is already trialling a scheme similar to Britain's congestion charge. There are also discussions about the possibility of producing cars that consume less petrol or that use ethanol and other biofuels. \"Alternative fuels are costly,\" says committee member Christian Azar, a climate change expert. \"Tax cuts and subsidies can help, but alternative fuels need to make economic sense on their own.\" The Swedish government has promised to increase the funding for energy research by 815m kronor (£60m) a year. It says it will also give subsidies or tax breaks to homeowners who replace their oil boilers (10% still use them), and to industries that switch from fossil fuels. The country's 9 million inhabitants appear supportive of their government's policies. According to recent research, the majority want to see more use of renewable energy, such as wind power and solar energy. But can Sweden kick the habit? Experts are cautiously optimistic. \"By 2020, I think no oil will be used for heating, and industries will have cut their consumption substantially,\" says Azar. \"But I don't think we will be able to phase out oil as a whole. There is not enough time.\" Meanwhile, far into the Atlantic Ocean, Iceland is living the green dream. If there's a paradise for environmentalists, this must be it. It is the world's most energy efficient country, with 70% of its needs covered by domestically produced renewables. The volcanic island and its 300,000 inhabitants are blessed with natural hot springs - the most extreme forms of which are the famous geysers. All of the island's electricity is produced cleanly - 84% through hydropower, while the rest comes from geothermal energy, using the heat from the earth (90% of homes already get their heating this way). Fossil fuels are used only for transport, but even here Iceland is determined to get rid of them completely. In 1998, the government decided to replace oil and gas with hydrogen - which would be produced from renewable energy sources - as soon as possible. Three years ago, it opened the world's first hydrogen station and started a trial of three buses powered by hydrogen. But it was not always like this. Iceland used to be a poor country that had to rely on imports of fossil fuels for everything. That is, until the 1973 oil shock, when Opec countries quadrupled prices. \"This was a trigger to reduce our dependency,\" explains Ragnheidur I Thorarinsdottir, deputy director of the National Energy Authority. \"We started converting houses to geothermal heating. Now the aim is to use our clean energy to 100%.\" Renewable energy gave Iceland an economic advantage, she says. \"Geothermal energy is very cheap. It costs less than fossil fuels.\" There have been attempts to export Iceland's green riches abroad. \"We have done studies on trying to send electricity through cables to Scotland and the Faroe Islands, but it's not economical. If energy prices continue to go up and the price of the technology comes down, then something could be done about it.\" But there's more to come. Iceland is looking at how to exploit its resources more efficiently, as it is estimated that it uses only 15% of its energy resources. If exploited to the full, it is thought the energy could supply all of the electricity of a country the size of Scotland. Back on mainland Europe, Finland, with its 5.2 million people, is looking to nuclear energy. It imports 70% of its energy requirements, including all of its gas, from neighbouring Russia. This makes it dependent on what happens next door. \"During the coldest days this winter, we've had problems with electricity supply from Russia,\" explains Jorma Aurela, senior engineer at the department of trade and industry. \"[Russia] was having problems itself supplying electricity to St Petersburg. Secure supplies are very important to us. That's why we need a mix of different energy sources.\" Running late Nuclear power accounts for 26% of Finland's electricity, but after the new Olkiluoto reactor is completed in 2009-10, this is expected to rise to 33%, becoming the most important source for the country's electricity. The plant is running late, however, and already the five-year construction period is about nine months behind schedule. But increasing nuclear power has been controversial. Successive governments had tried to push for construction of a new nuclear reactor since the early 80s, but after the Chernobyl disaster, in 1986, the plans were shelved. The government tried again in 1993, but parliament voted against it. Another bill was presented in 2002, and it was finally passed, but only by a narrow margin: all the parties were split on the issue and the green party left the government coalition in protest. \"Nuclear power is not safe, as Chernobyl proved, and there is also the risk of a terrorist attack,\" says Jaana Reijonaho, from the Green League. \"If we invest in nuclear power, this means renewable energies do not have a market to develop in. There's also the problem of uranium mining. If the world starts building more nuclear plants, we will have use to more uranium - and we come back to the same problem we have with oil. One day it will run out.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2005/aug/17/water.guardianletters","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2005-08-16T23:08:40Z","webTitle":"Letters: Splashing out on water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/aug/17/water.guardianletters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2005/aug/17/water.guardianletters","fields":{"headline":"Splashing out on water","bodyText":"It may be tempting to argue that household water metering on a national scale would ensure fair play as UK water supplies become less reliable (Start the meter running, August 15). But far from ensuring fair play, compulsory metering would do the opposite - with the poor and sick bearing the brunt. Rationing by price - the market - rarely works in the interests of those on limited incomes, especially when the commodity is as essential as water. Affluent households would not feel the pinch. But low-income households could face unaffordable bills. As it is, the average UK water bill is 12% higher this year than last, and one in five households is in debt to their water company. That's why any move to introduce compulsory metering must be accompanied by \"social tariffs\" to protect vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers from unaffordable water bills. Georgia Klein National Consumer Council Peter Preston is right - our changing climate, plus the double whammy of thousands of new homes in the south-east of England and increasing per-capita consumption of water, means that water supply is a much bigger issue than the arguments engaged in by the money men and the regulator. Access to water is a matter of ethics and doing the right thing to ensure that it is distributed fairly and is not wasted. Water is a postcode lottery leading to situations where middle England has drought-induced hosepipe bans, while local golf courses, for example, remain unfettered by such constraints. The government is committed to its plan for creating sustainable communities. This is only possible if water is supplied fairly and efficiently: two measures of a sustainable and civil society. Metering is a proven method of reducing water waste and cutting the cost to consumers. What could be fairer than that? Nick Reeves Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management Metering, and the price variations associated with it, will clearly be a linchpin of any long-term, sustainable water-supply policy. However Preston's focus on metering belies the sheer scale of water loss caused by our decaying infrastructure. Currently we lose a quarter of our water supply before it ever reaches our taps. The culture of water companies ordering spot repairs when pipe replacement is what is truly needed must be addressed immediately if we are to stem the flow of Britain's wasted water. The Green party is committed to metering as a sustainable water-supply policy in the light of climate change. However, we are also aware that until we dramatically reduce the amount of water lost in our ageing pipe systems, metering will continue to be seen as an unpopular, and somewhat ineffective policy. John Whitelegg Green party sustainable development spokesman Peter Preston does not make it clear that water is only in short supply because we are unwilling to use the energy available to desalinate and pump water from where it is available to where it is to be consumed. If we had a wise energy policy, we would convert the virtually inexhaustible supply of solar energy into locally generated electricity, make and lay the pipes, build the aqueducts, desalinate sea water, build reservoirs and pump water. Owen Ephraim Chelmsford, Essex Peter Preston is spot on. If we had a National Water Grid there would never be a water shortage. Why is there not one? It is because there is not and never has been the political will to do it. If oil can be pumped from the middle of the North sea, refined and piped to every part of the country then there is no reason why this cannot be done with water.

The homes of the returning Albanians had been destroyed and the infrastructure of their daily lives smashed beyond recognition. Appalled, Sinclair and Stohr turned to each other and said, 'Where the hell are the architects?' Given that architects are often known as the divas of the building world, associated - at least in the popular imagination - with hissy fits over multi-million pound prestige projects, this might sound like a strange question. After all, what possible application could these people have in a disaster situation? But British-born architect Sinclair, and Stohr, a writer with an encyclopedic knowledge of socially conscious building, believed that architects, treating disaster-struck communities as their clients, could be pivotal in finding locally based solutions for designing transitory housing, instead of the usual type of quick-fix temporary shelters that can ultimately become mini-disaster areas themselves. Furthermore, the couple believed that if this housing was properly designed, the disaster-struck community would be better empowered to rebuild. So they launched a design competition, extolling their fellow professionals to 'design like you give a damn', and come up with the best transitory housing for returning Kosovar communities. To their surprise they received 205 entries from 30 countries. Then they formed an organisation to try to implement the resulting designs. Architecture for Humanity (AFH) was born. Sinclair and Stohr might have continued in a similar vein - carrying on in their day jobs and launching similar competitions from their New York apartment - were it not for the events of 26 December 2004: the tsunami. 'This was,' records Sinclair, in the AFH's new book, Design Like you Give a Damn, 'a key moment, not just for our organisation but for the entire movement for socially conscious design. The need was immense.' Teaming up with Worldchanging.com (a website dedicated to the exchange of ideas), AFH raised half a million dollars, and Sinclair and Stohr suddenly found themselves answering the phone to just about every NGO on the planet. Their largest post-tsunami project was set up in the village of Kirinda in Sri Lanka, where five independent architects built community and civic buildings wiped out by the wave. Meanwhile, in Pottuvil, also in Sri Lanka, they partnered with Relief International to rebuild a small school and to create a prototype for housing for the Ampara region. And in the Tamil-Nadu region of India, they helped reconstruct the Caddalore and Villupuram Districts. Sinclair and Stohr finally quit their day jobs. Meanwhile, AFH chapters began sprouting up all over the world, and now 1,500 designers regularly meet to see what they can contribute. Two years on, AFH has completed five community rebuilding projects in Sri Lanka and three in India, as well as implementing a football pitch for women in South Africa. It has also consulted on housing structures for displaced populations in the Balkans, for post-disaster communities in Southern Iran and Grenada, and post-Hurricane Katrina housing schemes on the Gulf Coast of America. At least as significant as the physical projects is the fact that the organisation is altering the parameters of post-disaster design, shifting the end goals so as to engage architects to construct with the communities rather than for the victims. While Stohr is usually based in the Montana office, Sinclair is a kind of travelling salesman for humanitarian design, overseeing winning entries for AFH projects on the ground in Africa, Sri Lanka and India, convincing young designers to engage with humanitarian design rather than become a 'Cad monkey' (Computer Aided Design) via the lecture circuit, and increasingly picking up awards (he is on the shortlist for this year's Designer of the Year award run by the Design Museum). In fact, if you want to know where he is at any precise moment, you can check the AFH website, where a handy 'where's Cameron?' button enables you to pinpoint him, at least to a time zone. Today, he happens to be in London, having travelled overnight from Sri Lanka. Showing no signs of fatigue, he launches into an enthusiastic overview of AFH projects in Sri Lanka. Sinclair is a born communicator - which explains why, these days, he can fill a lecture theatre as quickly as Bill Clinton or Al Gore. He grew up partly in upstate New York, then went to boarding school in Bath, followed by Westminster University to study architecture at the prestigious Bartlett School of Architecture. Even then, Sinclair's interests lay solely 'in the real edges of design', placing him firmly on a collision course with his Bartlett tutors. 'We always hold aloft these nice jewels, these signature buildings for the few who can afford it, but what about the average citizen? Why can't we design for them?' he says. 'Take away all that ego and all we do is provide shelter, and if you can't do that, then don't call yourself an architect.' At Bartlett, a tutor told him that he found designing for the homeless depressing. 'I said I found not designing for the homeless depressing,' he recalls. He quit before the end of term and bought a one-way ticket to New York. There, he worked 17 hours a day on computer-aided design packages, cutting and pasting buildings together on screen. He claims that he can walk round London or New York pointing out buildings and telling you the Cad software used to design it. It was while working for one of many globalised architectural practices, designing lipstick dispensers in Johannesburg - where each lipstick cost more than the monthly wage of the average resident - that he had an epiphany. 'The role of a designer is not about creating spaces in cities for products that the bulk of citizens are unable to buy. Forget all those signature buildings that people moan are elitist, it's these tiny little projects that are the real problem.' The arresting Design Like you Give a Damn call to arms implies that for too long, too many designers have gone about their professional business without really caring, but why is this? In the book, Stohr explains both the evolution of humanitarian design and the small successes and many failures. What comes across is not so much a reluctance by design professionals to get involved, but a number of barriers that have precluded change. Much of the book is devoted to the question of shelter design. In effect it provides an intriguing compendium of designers' solutions to producing housing structure for displaced and disadvantaged populations. There are geodesic domes, flat-pack latrines, structures made from the basic tools of war - barbed wire and sandbags - shelters from shipping pallets or rubble, or inflatable hemp, materials local to the disaster like grass matting, bamboo leaves and plastic bags inflated via New York building vents or the Nasa-inspired 139 shelter that opens like a parasol, designed by Future Systems (best known in the UK for the Selfridges building in Birmingham). Some have been developed as a result of an AFH competition, some are already out 'in the field'. Mainly they represent glowing examples of ingenuity and potential in a field where design and designers with a humanitarian agenda have consistently repeated the same mistakes, despite the fact that back in the Forties Hassan Fathy, an Egyptian architect, was already railing against 'apostles of prefabrication and mass production' looking for a one-size-fits-all solution to housing-displaced populations. As Stohr notes in the book, 'Fathy saw the role of the architect as that of personal consultant yielding his or her training to the aspirations of the homeowner and the demands of local construction methods and materials.' In essence, this was an idea that Fred Cuny, a renegade engineer murdered while working in Chechyna in 1985, and another major source of AFH inspiration, was to progress when he began working in disaster relief in 1970. 'What really inspired me about him,' explains Cameron, 'was that he talked about how in these situations, much of the response is more harmful than the disaster itself. He saw that a lot of organisations were coming in with very Western solutions, and undercutting local history and the economy with their Band Aid approaches, which actually destroy the development that's been happening over the past decade.' If you consult with people as clients, they often have their own preferred (and better) solution. 'In Sri Lanka,' says Sinclair, 'we were talking about solar panels for a school and one of the villagers said, \"Well there's a guy who used to live here who had a windmill and he made energy from that.\" So now we're doing a wind farm, by the suggestion of the community. Renewable resources have become a big theme in the AFH canon, 'In every school I do now I want to implement rainwater collection,' he adds. 'If you have clean water kids come to school. What's more, you can do it for a couple of hundred pounds. And if you get passive solar energy in those schools, you can do adult schools at night.' According to Sinclair this is the crunch time for humanitarian design. It's not just about redesigning ineffectual tents, or 'hot boxes' as those in the disaster relief trade call the two-room shelters without ventilation that number-crunching NGOs lately rely on.'Currently one in seven people live in a slum or undefined settlement, and in 20 years, it's going to be one in three. Now is a critical time to get designers to think differently.' Like Sinclair, his wife Kate Stohr talks animatedly about the projects they have on the ground. She's in constant contact with AFH projects in India and Sri Lanka. Even when you've got the right architect and secured the funding you have to add local and international conflict (according to UN figures, in 2003 there were 38 conflicts in the world, accounting for 6,200,000 refugees), corruption and disease to the mix. Clearly no one is in it for the money, but Sinclair believes that, for a lot of design professionals, this is their natural calling: 'Ninety per cent of what an architect does is not drawing, it's problem solving. Besides, think about a prestige architect like Zaha Hadid. There are probably 20 people in Britain who could afford to commission her. I, on the other hand, have somewhere between 4 and 5bn people on the planet who are looking for my help. So,' he concludes with an affable smile, 'I have a lot more clients than she does.' · Design Like You Give A Damn Architectural Responses to Humanitarian Crises, edited by Architecture for Humanity is published by Thames &amp; Hudson in July at £16.95.The winner of the Designer of the Year competition will be announced on 22 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2004/jun/23/australia.davidfickling","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2004-06-22T23:18:34Z","webTitle":"Plan to halt wind in the woolies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/23/australia.davidfickling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2004/jun/23/australia.davidfickling","fields":{"headline":"Plan to halt wind in the woolies","bodyText":"Australia has some inventive solutions to greenhouse emissions, from burying carbon dioxide to building a half-mile-high tower to generate solar energy. But government researchers yesterday announced the strangest proposal yet - plans to vaccinate livestock to prevent them letting off methane. Methane is 23 more times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas and is produced by single-celled organisms which break down grass in the stomach and intestine before letting it out into the atmosphere. Each year, a cow produces in methane the equivalent energy of four tanks of petrol. Australia's 140m sheep and cattle are responsible for 14% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. In New Zealand - where a revolt by farmers last year halted plans for a livestock emissions levy dubbed the \"fart tax\" by protesters - the 40m cattle and sheep produce 60% of greenhouse emissions, more than the transport and power industries. The proposed vaccine will encourage natural antibodies to attack the organisms. Recent tests conducted for the government scientific institute Csiro in Queensland, to be reported in a forthcoming issue of the journal Vaccine, were able to cutemissions by 8%. The vaccine would also make the cows' production of meat and milk more efficient since the protozoans take away up to 13% of the energy value of the grass eaten. Margaret Puls, of Csiro's livestock industry project, said that the research was an important step forward, but that a functioning vaccine was some way off yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2006/dec/09/fiction.asbyatt","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2006-12-09T23:47:22Z","webTitle":"Willa Cather's fiction contains the mysteries of great writing, argues AS Byatt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/09/fiction.asbyatt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2006/dec/09/fiction.asbyatt","fields":{"headline":"American pastoral","bodyText":"Willa Cather was a great novelist, whose greatness was unrecognised for a long time. I had been teaching American literature for some years when I first met a reference to her - in Ellen Moers's Literary Women, in an intriguing discussion of sexualised landscape. In the 1980s Virago republished all her books, and I wrote introductions to most of them. It was an extraordinary experience - a meeting with a style, a subject matter, a narrative method and a vision of the nature of things I found profoundly alien, and discovered were of the utmost importance to me as a writer. I had always responded to American women poets and British women novelists. Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Marianne Moore, Ann Carson. Austen, Eliot, the Brontes, Bowen, Murdoch and Fitzgerald. Cather did not fit into any of the provisional categories in my mind - women, the 1920s, American fiction. She was a successful journalist and a much admired writer in her lifetime, though it was unfortunate - and symptomatic of her fate - that she won the Pulitzer prize in 1922 for One of Ours, a novel that does not quite work, about the first world war. Americans I met when I was writing those first introductions usually knew only My Antonia , and saw her as a writer they read at school, who specialised in \"local colour\" about frontier life. The theorists of American literature - Richard Chase and Leslie Fiedler, writing when I was teaching - ignored her completely. Malcolm Bradbury, who introduced much American literature to Britain, omitted her from his comprehensive survey. Hugh Kenner, a great critic, in A Home-Made World , a wonderful book on stay-at-home modern Americans (as opposed to modernist Americans in Paris) - does not mention her either. I thought when I began my reading for Virago that we were giving new life to a neglected, good writer. But Cather is not just a good writer - she is unique, and great. She was born in 1873 and died in 1947. She was a modernist when Dos Passos, Hemingway and Fitzgerald were boys, and was seen as out-of-date when they were writing, without having been understood. The more recent interest in her work among feminist critics and biographers has also to a certain extent obscured the fierceness and power of her writing. Cather was an intensely private woman, who shared much of her life with her friend Edith Lewis. Her papers are in the University of Nebraska; she left them on condition that her letters should never be quoted. There have been attempts to claim her for lesbian feminism, and attempts to criticise her for using male narrators, or to see those narrators as oppressive presences in a way she would have found nonsensical. All this is described, with passion and good humour, in an excellent brief book, Willa Cather and the Politics of Criticism, by Joan Acocella. There is also an excellent and wise biography by Hermione Lee. She has been steadily admired by stylists. Alice Munro learned from her; Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Wallace Stevens praised her perceptively. She learned from Virgil, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Henry James. She wrote 12 novels and some remarkable long and short stories. Her work can be divided into three periods. Between 1912 and 1918 she wrote novels about life in Nebraska, where she lived in her childhood. Between 1923 and 1926 she wrote what have been called her \"tragic\" novels, full of energy describing the end of energy. Her last two great novels - Death Comes for the Archbishop, and Shadows on the Rock , the first set in New Mexico and the second in Quebec, are about the time of the land, and the brevity and tenacity of human habitations in those lands. Each of these reinvents the novel form to look at a new human world, although their newness is contained in an extraordinary lucidity rather than in any overt \"experiment\". What did she write about? Acocella says \"the great subject of early 20th-century literature, the gulf between the mind and the world\". This is perceptive. Cather wrote about the subject of Ecclesiastes, the rising and setting of the sun, the brevity of life, the relation between dailiness and the rupture of dailiness, the moment when \"desire shall fail\". One of the virtues of her writing that I notice all the time, and find hard to describe, is the distance at which she stands from her text. Part of what I mean by this is contained in the fact that more than any other novelist she see her people's lives as whole and finished - they feel stress and passion, they discover and lose, but they are bounded by birth and death, by nothing and nothing, and they move between the two, adjusting their consciousnesses as they go. The writer always sees the people's lives whole and complete, wherever the story is along their line. Her own statements about her work are both terse and illuminating. Her first novel, Alexander's Bridge (1912), is a good novel about an engineer who builds a bridge which collapses. Her second, O Pioneers! (1913) was, she claimed, the one where she had found her own way of telling - with \"no arranging or inventing; everything was spontaneous and took its own place right or wrong ... Since I wrote this book for myself I ignored all the situations and accents that were then generally thought to be necessary.\" What she means by \"situations and accents\" is both dramatic tension and the scenes of confrontation or discovery towards which most novels move. O Pioneers! is a long, slow-paced series of visions or tableaux of the lives of the Swedish farmers on the Great Plains. It tells of planting and harvest, passionate love and murder, in the same inevitable, calm tone. Cather's friend ES Sergeant records that she complained to Cather that the only flaw in the book was that it had no sharp skeleton, and elicited the reply: \"... true enough, I had named a weakness. But the land has no sculptured lines or features. The soil is soft, light, fluent, black, for the grass of the plains creates this type of soil as it decays. This influences the mind and memory of the author and so the composition of the story.\" Soft, light, fluent, black. Also tough - Cather in this book writes as much about human stoicism as about human passion. The heroine's father observes her energy and liveliness as she works. Cather writes: \"But he would not have had it again if he could, not he! He knew the end too well to wish to begin again. He knew where it all went to, what it all became.\" There is the same sense of slowness and inevitability in her characterisation of Alexandra, sitting in a rocking chair with her Swedish bible. \"Her body was in an attitude of perfect repose, such as it was apt to take when she was thinking earnestly. Her mind was slow, truthful, steadfast. She had not the least spark of cleverness.\" This sense of life, birth, death and drama taking place on the undifferentiated black soil as the earth moves steadily through the seasons might be expected to have a pastoral charm, at the most. But Cather's prose gives it a grim and exciting sense of mortality. My Antonia , which is about the life of Bohemian immigrants, is narrated by Jim Burden, a classicist who understands Virgilian pastoral, and the similarities and differences between that and the harsh life of the settlers in the untouched landscape. He goes to Harvard and the city. Antonia, his neighbour, energetic and hopeful, stays on the earth, becoming a young toothless matriarch, still with grace and warmth. The Bohemians live in sod houses and sleep in cellars that are no more than holes in the plain. Their sod houses and the hummocks of their graves are much the same - protrusions from the earth that go back into it. Cather's control of her startling steady pace is more assured here - when she is rhapsodic, she does it briefly and elegiacally. And convincingly. Huge and terrible things happen, are given their due weight, and are reabsorbed into the soft, light, fluent black and brightness. Mr Shimerda, Antonia's father, desperate with grief for lost Hungary, commits suicide in the winter, laying aside his boots and clean shirt so that they shall not be blood-spattered. The extreme cold freezes the corpse and the pools of spilled blood, so that his death is perpetuated, as he can neither be laid out nor buried until the air is warmer. This frozen tragedy - which has also an atmosphere of practical housekeeping - becomes a tableau which haunts the reader, as it must haunt his family, but the narrative moves steadily on. In the summer, in the harvest, there is a rapid death - a wandering tramp suddenly and for no known reason jumps into the threshing machine and is dismembered. Antonia remarks that it is odd to imagine anyone wanting to do that in the good season of harvest and threshing. Both deaths are lightly told and unforgettable. They stain the reader's mind with a peculiar precision, partly because of the lack of conventional dramatic emphasis. The Song of the Lark (1915) appeared before My Antonia . It is the one of Cather's novels that most resembles other novels, in that it is a biography, and studies ambition, achievement and even love and passion in a reasonably conventional manner. It is the story of Thea Kronborg, a provincial girl from Moonstone, Colorado, who becomes a great operatic soprano, singing Wagner in the opera houses of America and Europe. It has appealed to the general public, and sold better than most of her other work. Cather herself found it problematic, and reissued it in 1932, having cut it savagely and removed nearly a 10th of the text. She wrote an essay in 1931, describing how William Heinemann had turned it down, and agreeing with his reasoning. She wrote an introduction to the cut version, explaining her reasons for the changes. Both are to do with an artist's sense of form, and its relation to the life of the artist. In the Preface she compares the artist's life to Oscar Wilde's story of Dorian Gray in reverse. The more successful the artist, the more the personal life becomes \"somewhat dry and preoccupied\". \"[Thea's] artistic life is the only one in which she is happy or free, or even very real.\" Kronborg absorbs and uses the life of her childhood in her art, but does not break her working life to return to her mother's deathbed. Cather came to feel that her own novel should have concentrated on the struggle to escape provincial philistinism and should not have detailed the growing strength of the successful singer. But the real problem was that she had chosen the wrong style - as she saw it - for her own art. Her remarks about Heinemann's rejection are splendidly revealing. \"He thought that in that book I had taken the wrong road, and that the full-blooded method which told everything about everybody, was not natural to me, and was not the one in which I would ever take satisfaction. 'As for myself,' he wrote, 'I always find the friendly, confidential tone of writing of this sort distressingly familiar, even when the subject matter is very fine.'\" The Cather who eschewed the intimate, confidential note in writing liked to use painting as an image for what she was trying to achieve. She was interested in fresco, and in the work of the French symbolist Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. \"I had all my life wanted to do something in the style of legend, which is absolutely the reverse of dramatic treatment. Since I first saw the Puvis de Chavannes frescoes of the life of St Genevieve in my student days, I have wished that I could try something like that in prose; something without accent, with none of the artificial elements of composition. In The Golden Legend the martyrdoms of the saints are no more dwelt on than are the trivial incidents of their lives; it is as though all human experiences, measured against one supreme spiritual experience, were of about the same importance. The essence of such writing is not to hold the note - not to use an incident for all there is in it - but to touch and pass on.\" Van Gogh said that Puvis de Chavannes's work represented a \"strange and providential meeting of very far- off antiquities and crude modernity\". Cather's classicism, her fresco-like structures, and her violence, represent the same collision. Chavannes's faraway, mysterious figures influenced the classicism of some of Picasso's early representational paintings. Another analogy might be to the American modernism of William Carlos Williams, with his belief in \"no ideas but in things\", his simply stated red wheelbarrow, and his anthology of the western discovery of America, In the American Grain . In that book he constructs a patchwork of voices of the dead who struggled to describe a place and a way of life that had never previously been described. Cather too is deeply concerned with forging a language and a series of images to represent the new, the unwritten. Another comparison Cather used came from the domestic stillness of Dutch and Flemish paintings of interiors. \"In many of them the scene presented was a living-room warmly furnished, or a kitchen full of food and coppers. But in most of the interiors, whether drawing-room or kitchen, there was a square window, open, through which one saw the masts of ships, or a stretch of grey sea. The feeling of the sea that one got through those square windows was remarkable, and gave me a sense of the fleets of Dutch ships that ply quietly in all the waters of the globe ...\" In her 50s Cather published three novels which are often called tragedies - A Lost Lady (1923), The Professor's House (1925) and My Mortal Enemy (1926). Both A Lost Lady and The Professor's House are tragic in the sense that they present the slow process described in the Book of Ecclesiastes: Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them ... when the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets. Both novels present a vision of the youth and strength of the early European explorers and settlers of north America as a kind of primeval Eden, full of light and life, which has fallen away into vulgarity, real estate, ugly urban life. The decay of the pioneering vision of the land goes with the ageing of the central characters. In A Lost Lady the young male narrator idealises Marian Forrester, the beautiful and generous wife of a railway pioneer who loses his fortune compensating his shareholders in a market crash. She degenerates, taking lovers, drinking, becoming shoddy and shabby, and even becomes the mistress of the snake in the garden, the evil Ivy Peters, who is first seen putting out the eyes of a woodpecker for fun. Desire fails, both in narrator and his beloved, and is replaced by world-weariness. I sometimes think The Professor's House is Cather's masterpiece. It is almost perfectly constructed, peculiarly moving, and completely original. It is the story of Godfrey St Peter, a successful professor whose great work has been a history of \"Spanish Adventurers in North America\". The adventurers are related to the railway pioneers in A Lost Lady - Cather herself compares both to the crusaders, brave men with a vision. In an early essay (1896) on \"The Kingdom of Art\" the young Cather had compared the daring artist also to the crusaders, who suffered and died in the burning deserts, and found no paradise - \"only death and the truth\". St Peter is happily married, with two daughters. He lives near the shore of Lake Michigan. The novel is the tale of his experience of the failure of desire. There are two \"houses\" - a brand-new one, purchased with the prize-money he won for his masterpiece, into which he is expected to move, and the old house, where he persists in working in his old study, which doubles as a sewing-room, and is inhabited by two dressmakers' \"forms\" - one made of \"a dead opaque, lumpy solidity, like chunks of putty or tightly packed sawdust\", one in wire, with no legs, no viscera, and a bosom like a bird-cage. They are household gods, turned to lifeless yet threatening idols. At this point I must emphasise the other side of Cather, the teller of tales about great journeys, hard endeavours, single-mindedness. She can describe domestic comforts, the minutiae of pots, pans, food, so as to make them glittering and strange, as though seen for the first time. She wrote perceptively about Katherine Mansfield and her great gift for showing the simultaneous beauty and terror of group life, domestic life. She studies French domestic subtleties, tended by women, or by priests, in alien American landscapes, hot New Mexico, cold Quebec. She believes passionately in civilisation, as Virgil saw it, as the Dutch painters recorded it in their domestic interiors. In the essay on Mansfield she describes human relationships as \"the tragic necessity of human life; they can never be wholly satisfactory, every ego is half the time greedily seeking them, and half the time pulling away from them\". The professor has sought them, and is now pulling away from them. The triumph of the novel is the story inserted into it. \"Tom Outland's Story\" is the tale of a brilliant young man, who later became the professor's student, made a scientific discovery of a gas that left him rich, and died in the first world war, before he could marry St Peters's daughter, to whom he left his patents. In the inserted story he explores a mesa in New Mexico, working as a cattle driver. The golden silence of New Mexico, the thin air of the heights, the riding and work, are the equivalent in this novel of the grey seas glimpsed through the window in a Dutch painting. In it Outland discovers \"a little city of stone, asleep\". \"I knew at once that I had come upon the city of some extinct civilisation, hidden away in this inaccessible mesa for centuries, preserved in the dry air and almost perpetual sunlight like a fly in amber.\" Cather said she wanted to juxtapose the stone city, the \"fresh air that blew off the Blue Mesa\" with \"Professor St Peter's house, rather over-crowded and stuffy with new things; American proprieties, clothes furs, petty ambitions, quivering jealousies\". The young man, Outland, on the uninhabited mesa feels pure energy. \"Nothing tired me. Up there, alone, a close neighbour to the sun, I seemed to get the solar energy in some direct way.\" Cather describes the sun, the rock, the jars made by the vanished people, the mysterious body of a woman, violently killed, so that each detail is unforgettable. Then she returns us to St Peter, in danger of dying from escaping house-gas on his lumpy sofa, thinking grimly of Longfellow's translation of an Anglo-Saxon poem about a third kind of house. For thee a house was built Ere thou wast born; For thee a mould was made Ere thou of woman camest. He is reminded by his sagging sofa of \"the sham upholstery that is put in coffins\". \"Just the equivocal American way of dealing with serious facts, he reflected. Why pretend that it is possible to soften that last hard bed.\" He thinks he would rather be alone in the grave than with his wife - whom he loves. \"He thought of eternal solitude with gratefulness, as a release from every obligation, from every form of effort. It was the Truth.\" No one has written better about the pull of solitude. Most novels are about human relations. This one is about the desire to be released from them. Nietzsche thought a \"strong pessimism\" was what human beings needed. It is paradoxically invigorating. My Mortal Enemy is a real tragedy, constructed out of a real romance - the story of a rich and determined young woman, who ran away with a penniless lover, seen through the eyes of a much younger woman narrator. This story too is of the failing of desire - a failing so complete that the \"heroine\" comes to refer to her loving and patient husband as \"my mortal enemy\". The word mortal here is of course, completely double. A mortal enemy is a determined destroyer. A mortal enemy is simply a mortal man. The book is brief, and at first I liked it less than some of the apparently stranger and more complicated ones. But the writer in me thinks about it now almost more than about any other. In it Cather has completely achieved her aim of telling by showing, and showing by making an arrested, mysterious image. Nellie Birdseye, the narrator is a good observer of things and expressions, pleasant and unpleasant, about the not-entirely romantic Myra. Each brief, glancing episode is a perfect revelation of something new and unexpected. It is still and violent. Not one word is wasted or redundant. It is distant and at the same time unbearably moving. The writer knows completely the tale she is telling, its beginning and its end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2006/jun/08/climatechange1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-06-08T09:05:22Z","webTitle":"It's too late for the planet: or can we pull it from the fire?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/jun/08/climatechange1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/jun/08/climatechange1","fields":{"headline":"It's too late for the planet: or can we pull it from the fire?","bodyText":"Robin McKie: James Lovelock has a simple message for the nation's eco-warriors. Forget your hybrid car, mini-turbine on your roof, your carefully recycled rubbish and endless efforts to cut carbon emission. The whole business is not worth the effort. 'Why should we sacrifice ourselves for the rest of the world when everyone else is going to keep on doing what they have always been doing?' he says. 'In a wonderful world, we would all co-operate. But life is not like that.' Attempts to induce co-operation over climate are thus doomed to failure, says Lovelock, creator of the Gaia theory (which likens the Earth to a breathing, living entity). He compares the 'worthless, morally bankrupt' Kyoto agreement with the Munich treaty of 1938. 'Kyoto does not even attempt to address the issue of land use, for example,' he points out. Humans have appropriated 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface to sustain a global population now heading towards seven billion. It is a process causing as much damage to the planet as the mayhem being triggered by rising carbon emissions, adds Lovelock. Yet Kyoto does not attempt to address that part of our planetary crisis in any way. This is not the only similarity he sees between our present climate crisis and the threat once posed by Nazi Germany. 'The coming years will be just like the war years,' argues Lovelock, now 86, but in startlingly good cheer for a doom-monger. 'It was awful, but everyone had a sense of purpose. We will need that again in the next few decades.' The key point, he says, is to realise that humanity is now at war with the planet. We have assailed his beloved Gaia for too long and it is about to wreak revenge. Ice caps are melting and meadows being transformed into deserts. Millions were killed between 1939 and 1945. Billions will die in the forthcoming climatic change. Thus we need to start preparing our defences urgently against the onslaught, Lovelock says: houses, towns and cities need to be moved to higher ground; flood protection - including a new Thames barrage - need to be built; levees must be constructed to protect the country's most productive farmland, the low-lying field systems of the east coast of England. But Lovelock says there is some good news: there is no need to worry about emissions from coal-fired power stations, building new wind turbines or developing underground carbon storage silos or new wave power plants. 'Our coal plants have little effect on global carbon emissions, wind turbines are just a blot on the landscape that produce very little power, and wave and carbon storage schemes - though possessing great potential - will take too long to develop. 'We have run out of time. It is as simple as that. The climate is changing far faster than we thought it would and we are going to feel the effects very soon.' Lovelock simply falls off the spectrum when it comes to predicting misery and destruction. The fact his grim diatribes are delivered by such a cheery figure, and by a scientist of such repute, with such a clear command of his facts and figures, only makes our impending problems seem all the more alarming. He is an unexpected ecological Jeremiah. He was raised by working-class parents in inner-city Brixton, south London, and did not leave the area until 1932. 'I was fairly glad to get out. There's nothing wrong with Brixton, but my parents' new home in Orpington was at the edge of countryside in those days, which meant I could go for walks and take my bike into Kent. There was no agri-business and no wind farms. Just miles of unspoiled fields, woods and paths.' The countryside is the face of Gaia, Lovelock adds, being his concept of the Earth as a living organism, or at least a set of biological systems in constant check with each other and which maintain the conditions that make life possible on our planet. The roots of this idea can be traced to Lovelock's love of nature and his rambles in Kent. However, it was not until he moved to the village of Bowerchalke, in Wiltshire, and when he began working as a scientist, that he developed the Gaia theory, in conjunction with biologist Lynn Margulis. Gaia is not his name. That came from Lovelock's old drinking buddy, the novelist William Golding, another of Bowerchalke's residents. He decided the theory could do with a decent name and gave it that of the Greek goddess of the Earth. Neither did the Gaia hypothesis, first published in 1979, go down well with the scientific community. 'It got a hard time, but all theories do,' admits Lovelock. Today, it has become part of mainstream science. When I interviewed Lovelock in London he had come to accept the Geological Society's Wollaston Medal and, given that previous recipients include Charles Darwin, we can see how mainstream his thinking, and how influential his views, have become. For years, he was the darling of the green movement. Then, a couple of years ago, he announced our planet was in such grave danger from carbon emissions that only nuclear power plant construction could save it. The call went down badly in some circles and was condemned by ardent greenies. Lovelock is unrepentant: 'What's so bad about nuclear power? It has drawbacks, but they are nothing like those that will be unleashed once global warming takes a grip of the planet. We are going to have to become much more self-reliant as a nation and nuclear power is the one way of ensuring we can provide our own energy needs.' The fact that the creator of the Gaia theory could make such a heretical pronouncement has not been without an impact. 'Popular opinion has gone from being totally against new nuclear power plants for Britain to being divided, 50-50, over its deployment here,' he claims. He is probably right. One convert appears to be Tony Blair, who has endorsed construction of a new generation of atomic plants for Britain. The man who changed our thinking about the world and its living beings may also have profoundly altered the way it will fight the battle against environmental mayhem. Nick Mathiason: 'Society, government and companies are moving together as we come to grips with the solutions we need and are confronted with the cost,' says Graeme Sweeney, chief executive of Shell Renewables. The 54-year-old Scottish born Shell-lifer is confident that the stark challenges posed by our energy-hungry world are being met by partnership and technology. Sceptics are dismissed at a stroke. Suggest that the oil industry has been painfully slow to harness its vast wealth to solve environmental catastrophe by investing in new renewable technologies and Sweeney races through the rebuttal. 'Shell has the broadest portfolio of relevant solutions of any oil company and an established track record of committing and doing it,' he says from his office in Amsterdam. 'We've been in the solar energy business since 1997 and in the wind business since the late Nineties. We've established clear and leading positions there. 'We are the leading marketer and blender of biofuels, with an established position in second-generation low-carbon technology.' Shell's UK country chairman, James Smith, believes the oil major will play a pivotal role in solving some of the world's biggest challenges. 'The richest billion people on the planet consume 50 per cent of the energy and the poorest billion consume 4 per cent, so unwinding that is our biggest challenge from an economic and social justice standpoint and I see Shell involved in the resolution of these disparities,' he says. Smith presents the challenges as if on army manoeuvres: how to cut damaging amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere when the economy and population is growing hugely. 'If we let it run we may have the energy, but we destroy the climate.' Smith believes there are 'two big levers' to combat this: energy efficiency within the economy - using half the energy for the same economic effect - and less carbon intensity of the energy itself. He maintains that the technology is available and the likelihood is that fossil fuel will be the main energy supplier until the mid-century. Sweeney agrees. 'There's a growing demand for energy in almost all forward-looking scenarios,' he says. 'And within that, there's most likely to be a larger call on fossil fuels than today. So total demand grows; the share of large carbon grows, including renewables and potentially nuclear, but at the end of all that the absolute amount of fossil fuels to meet this energy demand also rises.' The biggest weapon to deal with this, says Shell, is burying the CO2 problem under the carpet - literally. Sweeney has high hopes for its Norwegian North Sea project that it says will capture and store underground up to 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually - the same as would be produced by one million cars. It will cost £870m. The project is a joint venture with Norwegian oil firm, Statoil and will depend on 'substantial' government funding. Shell's renewables chief sees carbon capture and storage as a vital tool for cutting CO2 emissions and helping to reduce global warming, but the technique is still in its infancy. 'Carbon storage is essential. I can't see routes to meet our obligations that don't require significant carbon capture and storage.' However, it is by no means a cure-all. There are not enough oil recovery opportunities to store the amount of carbon needed to meet our Kyoto targets. So Sweeney believes carbon storage should be tradable under the EU emission trading scheme. With Britain seemingly heading for a nuclear future, and with energy firms' emphasis on carbon sequestration accounting for huge sums of money, is there a danger that both agendas will seize all the investment money, leaving renewable energy in the cold? 'I can imagine a future in which that's what happens but I can also imagine one in which the UK gets its act together on offshore wind and it will be a significant contributor,' says Sweeney. 'You need to make choices about what you're going to do to balance concerns over affordability, environment and security. And you could say it's about striking the right balance. This leads me to a view that we need more fossil fuels but we need them in the long run with integrated CO2 solutions. We do need to build low-carbon renewable energy sources. We need to improve our energy efficiency and that's true for society at the global level, in the UK, and for Shell as well.' Sweeney believes the giant offshore wind project known as the London Array could provide a major breakthrough in the UK low-carbon energy mix. The array in the Thames Estuary could, by 2010, produce one gigawatt of power - enough to supply 750,000 homes in the capital. Shell, part of the consortium that wants to build the array, is awaiting a planning decision scheduled for later this year. 'A positive decision would be a clear signal that a substantial contribution could be made by renewable energy if we could all drive this through to a successful conclusion.' Hopes that onshore wind farms will provide a significant renewable energy source are unrealistic, argues Sweeney. 'Clearly a substantial amount of people don't want it,' he says. For Britain, the solution is offshore, he believes, though the costs are greater, which will 'require a different level of support than that currently offered under the renewables obligation'. Shell prefers not to indicate how much money it costs energy firms to meet the government's renewable obligation, the percentage of renewable generation they must provide as part of their energy mix. But industry sources say that if money saved by energy firms through carbon trading and increased efficiencies was recycled directly into new renewable projects the overall spend would be less onerous. There are indications that within months the government will encourage energy firms to do just that. Shell is working under encouragement from government to build a biofuel refinery at Stanlow. The biofuel will mainly come from imported sources, says Sweeney, though many would prefer to see the government give more encouragement to domestic biofuel producers. Sweeney plays down the importance of solar in Britain. 'Solar in the UK context is not going to make a big impact but if you think about energy efficiency and the opportunity to integrate and design new build with solar, then I'm actually in favour of that.' Shell is beginning to develop a series of oil platforms that are renewably powered. Several of these platforms are now in the North Sea recovering small pockets of oil. It is a leading light in turning clean coal into gas and with Canadian biotech firm Iogen is pioneering biofuel to power cars made from grass. Smith is keen to play up the importance of recruiting from as wide an ethnic pool as possible to attract the best talent to overcome the energy challenges of tomorrow. The oil major is trying to shake off its image of an inward-looking industry entity. It will need to if it is serious about playing a role in reducing the harmful effects of fossil fuels and being at the vanguard of innovation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2004/nov/03/environment.environment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2004-11-03T00:49:10Z","webTitle":"Britain falls behind in solar race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/03/environment.environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2004/nov/03/environment.environment","fields":{"headline":"Solar eclipse","bodyText":"It's clean, silent and uses no fuel - only sunlight. Photovoltaic, or PV technology, is probably the most benign method of power generation available. But despite the government's professed commitment to renewable power, the UK still trails far behind other countries in this field. While Germany generates nearly 400 megawatts of solar power, the UK manages just six megawatts. Earlier this year, California's state government announced plans to install solar power systems in a million homes over the next 10 years. The UK, meanwhile, has quietly reduced its target of installing solar power units on 3,000 domestic roofs to 2,000 roofs. The UK climate cannot be compared favourably with that of sun-drenched California, and the British government seems to believes that its renewable energy policy should reflect the realities of the British weather. Since 2002, the government has invested £31m in solar power, but nearly £1bn on wind farms. Even in countries with more developed PV infrastructures, such as Germany, the US and Japan, solar energy contributes a tiny percentage of the energy supply, according to a Department of Trade and Industry spokeswoman. Often this is only possible thanks to public subsidies - something the government here is keen to avoid, she adds. \"The government wants a sustainable market. It doesn't want to have a sector that is underpinned by government support.\" Without government backing, however, it seems unlikely that Britain's fledgling PV sector will be able to stand on its own feet. \"It's a young industry, and there seems to be an acute skill shortage. We haven't got the capacity to actually put cells in, and the supply chain is very fragmented,\" says Sue Roaf, architecture professor at Oxford Brookes university. Solar cells are still relatively expensive (a household system could cost up to £20,000), and while conventionally-generated household energy remains relatively cheap, the PV sector has not attained the economies of scale that would allow it to break out of its current niche and find a mass market. That has been possible in other countries, thanks in part to favourable energy tariffs on offer when consumers sell surplus electricity back to the energy companies. But incentives based on generating capacity often promote large-scale PV that bear no relationship to local needs, says Philip Wolfe, chief executive of the Renewable Power Association. \"In Germany a lot of the rooftop systems are really much bigger than the house needs. Most countries just go for large solar arrays in fields, or bolt-on systems, whereas in the UK our approach is to design systems that are appropriate for their location.\" According to Wolfe, PV is at its most effective when tailored for a single building or group of buildings. And while PV alone is the least cost-effective renewable source of energy compared with other methods, its value multiplies when deployed alongside other renewable sources, such as combined heat and light power plants. The government has not officially announced what will replace the two existing PV funding programmes (the ClearSkies grants scheme and the Major Demonstration programme) when they come to an end in late 2005, but the DTI is drawing up a \"low-carbon buildings programme\" that will seek to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in new construction. No funding will be allocated specifically for PV technology, but the low-carbon programme will promote solar energy, says Kirk Archibald, PV programme manager of the Energy Saving Trust. \"A lot of other technologies won't be suitable. You can't stick a whopping great wind turbine on to an office building.\" \"Solar PV is the only renewable technology for generating electricity that you can use in a very densely populated urban environment. Unlike wind turbines or tidal barrages, it doesn't require any other civil engineering works to develop it. You can just stick it on the roof,\" says Dan Davies, engineering director of Solar Century, which designs solar energy systems. Like many advocates of solar energy, Davies argues that its future lies in its integration in the construction process. The cost of PV systems can be offlaid by including them in new structures as they are erected, while the cells themselves are cheaper than materials used in modern buildings. But for this vision of solar energy to become widespread, the construction industry (and its consumers) will have to learn to see PV cells as integral components of a building, rather than optional add-ons that can increase property values or reduce energy bills. \"Our task is to get the building industry to completely understand it as a building product as opposed to an energy generator,\" says Archibald. \"It's a new technology for the building industry, and it's going to take time for people to learn it. That is happening, but it's not going to happen overnight,\" says Rod Hacker, associate director of the engineering consultancy Halcrow. One way to speed up the process would be the introduction of new building regulations obliging each new development to include solar electricity, as suggested earlier this year by the Welsh secretary (and former energy minister), Peter Hain. The proposal has found many echoes in the renewables sector, which fears that construction firms will remain wary as long as PV cell prices remain high. \"Most traditional builders haven't taken a massive interest in PV, and they won't until legislation moves forward. Some of the more progressive national firms are interested, but I don't see them doing an extensive amount of rooftop PV systems without building regulations to level the competitive playing field,\" says Wolfe. And without strong government support for PV, the UK's renewables policy is likely to focus heavily on wind power, says Davies. \"That's not a bad thing in terms of carbon impact, but it does mean that the results of [the government's PV investment] will be lost, and the future of PV will come from Japanese, German or US companies,\" he says. \"Solar PV is predicted to be a massive global market. It has been growing at 30% to 40% a year for the past 10 years. The UK should be part of it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2005/nov/02/guardiansocietysupplement6","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2005-11-02T00:56:22Z","webTitle":"Running on empty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/nov/02/guardiansocietysupplement6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2005/nov/02/guardiansocietysupplement6","fields":{"headline":"Running on empty","bodyText":"Not far from the mouth of the Amazon, dead animals, including manatees - mammals up to 10ft long with flat, paddle-shaped fins - and distinctive pink dolphins, line the banks of some tributaries. Normally, you would have to take a boat to cross these rivers but today, because of the Amazon basin's worst drought in memory, they are little more than mudflats with a trickle of water in the middle. So far, the drought has had its most serious impact in the upper reaches of the river and its hundreds of tributaries in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. There, along many stretches, the water has fallen to the lowest levels ever recorded and has become impassable even for canoes. Some 600 Brazilian schools in Amazonas state have had to be closed and many hamlets, whose only contact with the outside world is by river, are running short of food and medicines. Several districts have been declared disaster areas and the army is having to bring emergency supplies to 900 towns and villages. The problems are expected to get worse before the drought eventually breaks, perhaps in the next month when the Amazon's rainy season usually comes. \"Most little towns don't have sewage treatment,\" says Dan Nepstad, a US scientist based in Brazil. \"Their sewerage is to put a pipe into the river. When you reduce the flow of these rivers, you have less water to dilute the sewage and cesspools build up. That has got all the makings for intestinal diseases and cholera. Water that's not moving is also a breeding ground for insects that carry malaria, dengue and other diseases.\" But what is worrying some scientists even more than the growing scale of the humanitarian crisis is a suspicion that this year's drought may be the harbinger of a much greater disaster that could push the whole Amazon forest to a critical flip-over point and into an unstoppable process of self-destruction. Recycled rain This is how the theory goes: the Amazon river contains a fifth of the planet's fresh water. Two hundred miles wide at its estuary, it carries more water than the world's next nine largest rivers combined. In a remarkable process, much of this water is recycled within the forest. \"The watering of the Amazon basin is a cycle that starts with the trade winds that fly over the surface of the Atlantic Ocean from Africa,\" explains Peter Bunyard, science editor of The Ecologist and an expert on the Amazon. \"The winds flow over warm tropical water so they become utterly laden with moisture. When the winds reach the Amazon forest, some of the vapour comes down in rainfall, but three-quarters of this rainfall is then recycled back into the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration - which occurs when water is sucked up from the soil into the trunks and then out through the leaves. This process of convection, as it is called, occurs seven times as the winds cross the continent. It leads to the absorption of huge amounts of solar energy,\" says Bunyard. When the winds eventually hit the Andes in the west, a huge air mass is pushed high up into the atmosphere. It moves out of the influence of the spinning of the Earth and drifts back to Africa. \"By the time this air mass reaches Africa, it is high, cold, dry and dense,\" says Bunyard. \"It forms a high-pressure zone and, in sinking, causes the dry winds that blow across the Kalahari and Sahara deserts towards the Atlantic ocean. Africa's deserts are the other side of the coin to the tropical forest in the Amazon.\" This process occurring around the very middle of the Earth is the driving force in the world's climate. It is directly responsible for much of the rainfall in South America and even, scientists have discovered, in faraway places such as the corn belt in the US mid-west. If there is poor rainfall in the Amazon's rainy season (November to February), then the US is likely to have a drought four months later during its all-important growing season. What happens to the Amazon affects the rest of the planet, and scientists have long been aware that if too much forest is felled by loggers, cattle rearers and soya farmers, the convection process will be disrupted, with disastrous global consequences. \"If the Amazon loses more than 40% of its forest cover, we will reach a turning point where the world's largest forest will begin an irreversible process of savannisation,\" says Carlos Nobre, a senior scientist at INPE, the Brazilian institute of space research, and a leading climatologist. The consensus is that a smaller forest would be unable to sustain the convection process and will start drying out. A vicious spiral will begin in which the drier forest becomes more vulnerable to forest fires and the fires, by destroying vegetation, will make the Amazon more vulnerable to drought. Until last week it was widely assumed that only 17 % of the forest - an area larger than the size of France - had been felled. This is well short of the critical 40% postulated by Nobre, but an article printed in Science journal last month shows that the satellite images on which this figure was based were not telling the full story. Destruction The images, the scientists said, were detecting only clear-cut swaths of land, where all the trees had been removed. They were failing to detect so-called \"selective logging\", where timber companies go into a forest under the canopy and take out valuable hard timber. The scientists reckoned that this kind of activity was destroying on average an additional 15,500 square kilometres of forest each year. This means that the destruction, previously put at about 20,000sq km a year, is almost twice as serious as had been thought. Dorothy Stang, an American nun who was killed in February by gunmen sent in by local landowners, was a passionate environmentalist. Living in the Amazon basin for over 20 years, she complained in one of her last filmed interviews of the devastation caused by loggers and cattle farmers, which, she believed, was changing the climate. \"It used to rain steadily for nine months,\" she said. \"Now it rains for six or seven months at best. The destruction is killing the forest. We've got to stop it.\" · Sue Branford was the BBC's Brazil correspondent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2006/jan/25/china.guardiansocietysupplement","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2006-01-25T02:14:13Z","webTitle":"A new world order","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jan/25/china.guardiansocietysupplement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2006/jan/25/china.guardiansocietysupplement","fields":{"headline":"A new world order","bodyText":"For almost as long as I can remember, the experts have been saying that the US, with 5% of the world's population, consumes a third or more of the Earth's resources. That is no longer true. China has now overtaken America as the world's leading resource consumer. Among the basic commodities - grain and meat in the food sector, oil and coal in the energy sector, and steel in the industrial sector - China now consumes more of each of these than the US except for oil. It consumes nearly twice as much meat - 67m tonnes compared with 39m tonnes in the US; and more than twice as much steel - 258m tonnes to 104m. The important questions now are: what if China's consumption per person of these resources reaches the current US level, and how long will it take for China's income per person to reach the US level? If China's economy expands at 8% a year in the decades ahead, its income per person will reach the current US level in 2031. If at that point China's resource consumption per person were the same as that in the US today, its 1.45 billion people would consume the equivalent of two-thirds of the current world grain harvest. China's paper consumption would be double the world's current production. Say goodbye to the world's forests. If China were to have three cars for every four people - as in the US - it would have 1.1bn cars. Worldwide today there are 800m cars. To provide the roads and parking spaces to accommodate such a vast fleet, China would have to pave an area comparable to the land it now plants in rice - 29m hectares (72m acres). It would use 99m barrels of oil a day; the world currently produces only 84m barrels daily, and may never produce much more. The western economic model - the fossil fuel-based, car-centred, throwaway economy - is not going to work for China. If it does not work for China, it will not work for India, which by 2031 is projected to have a population even larger than China's. Nor will it work for the 3 billion other people in developing countries who are also dreaming the \"American dream\". In an increasingly integrated global economy, where all countries are competing for the same oil, grain and iron ore, the existing economic model will no longer work for industrial countries either. Time for Plan B Sustaining our early 21st-century global civilisation now depends on shifting to a renewable energy powered, re-use/recycle economy with a diversified transport system. Business as usual - Plan A - cannot take us where we want to go. It is time for Plan B, time to build a new economy. Glimpses of the new economy can already be seen in the wind farms of western Europe, the solar rooftops of Japan, the fast-growing hybrid car fleet of the US, the reforested mountains of South Korea, and the bicycle-friendly streets of Amsterdam. Virtually everything we need to do to build an economy that will sustain economic progress is already being done in one or more countries. In this economic restructuring, the biggest challenges will come in the energy economy as the world strives simultaneously to reduce carbon emissions and dependence on oil. Over the past five years, production of energy from oil and coal expanded by 2% and 3% a year, respectively, while wind and solar energy grew by some 30% a year. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is under way, but, unfortunately, it is not moving nearly fast enough to stabilise the climate or slow the depletion of oil reserves. Among the new sources of energy - wind, solar cells, solar thermal, geothermal, small-scale hydro and biomass - wind is developing fastest, hinting at what the new energy economy will look like. In Europe, which is leading the world into the wind era, wind-electric generation is sufficient to meet the residential needs of some 40 million people. The European Wind Energy Association has projected that by 2020 some 195 million Europeans - half of the region's population - could get their residential electricity from wind. Wind energy is growing fast for the following reasons: it is abundant, cheap, inexhaustible, widely distributed, clean and climate benign. No other energy source has this combination of attributes. The US has enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national electricity needs several times over. Wind electric generation in America, which expanded by 35% last year, is on the verge of exploding as rising natural gas prices spur investment in this cheaper source of electricity. China could easily double its current electricity generation from wind alone. For the US vehicle fuel sector, which is widely seen as one of the most challenging segments of the world energy economy to restructure, the key to quickly reducing oil use and carbon emissions is petrol-electric hybrid cars. Fuel efficiency ratings from the US Environmental Protection Agency show that the average new car sold in the US last year travelled 22 miles to the gallon, compared with 55 miles a gallon for the Toyota Prius, a mid-sized petrol-electric hybrid. If, for oil security and climate stabilisation reasons, America over the next 10 years replaced its entire fleet of passenger vehicles with super-efficient petrol-electric hybrids, petrol use could easily be cut in half. A change in the number of cars or miles driven would not be necessary. Beyond this, a petrol-electric hybrid with an additional storage battery and a plug-in capacity would allow motorists to use electricity exclusively for short-distance driving, such as the daily commute and grocery shopping. This could cut US petrol use by an additional 20%, for a total reduction of 70%. Investment in thousands of wind farms across the US to feed cheap electricity into the grid would mean Americans could do most short-distance driving with wind energy, dramatically reducing carbon emissions and the pressure on world oil supplies. Using timers to recharge batteries during the low-demand hours late at night, with electricity coming from wind farms, costs the equivalent of, or less than, 60 cents a gallon of petrol. The US has not only an inexhaustible alternative to oil but also an incredibly cheap one. Taxing negative activities The key to restructuring the global economy is restructuring national tax systems. In effect, lowering taxes on income and increasing those on environmentally destructive activities. This has progressed fastest in Europe, where countries are taxing negative activities, such as carbon emissions, the generation of rubbish (landfill taxes), and cars driven in cities. A four-year plan adopted in Germany in 1999 systematically shifted taxes from labour to energy. By 2001, this plan had lowered fuel use by 5%. It had also accelerated growth in the renewable energy sector, creating some 45,400 jobs by 2003 in the wind industry alone - a number that is projected to rise to 103,000 by 2010. In 2001, Sweden launched a bold new 10-year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30bn kroner (£2.2bn) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities. Much of this shift - £624 per household - is levied on road transport, including substantial hikes in vehicle and fuel taxes. Cities that are being suffocated by cars are using stiff entrance taxes to reduce congestion. The revenue from London's congestion charge for cars entering the inner city is being invested in improving the bus network, which carries 2 million passengers daily. The goal is a restructuring of the London transport system to reduce congestion, air pollution and carbon emissions, and to increase mobility. Ecologists have long been convinced of the need to restructure the global economy in order to protect natural support systems and to stabilise the climate. China's growth is also convincing economists of the need for restructuring. Our civilisation is not the first to move onto an environmentally unsustainable economic path. Some earlier civilisations in a similar situation were able to make the required adjustments in the time available. Others were not. We study the archaeological sites of the latter. Of all the resources needed to build an economy that will sustain economic progress, none is more scarce than time. With climate change, we may be approaching the point of no return. The temptation is to reset the clock. But we cannot. Nature is the timekeeper. · Lester R Brown is president of the Earth Policy Institute and author of Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilisation in Trouble, published by WW Norton &amp; Co, RRP £10.99.

The memo cites ExxonMobil as an actor in this dismal effort to emulate the tobacco industry. The deans and bishops of British science are preparing a systematic fightback, it seems. Good for them, and not before time. The planners of the fightback will need to consider historical context, if they are to appreciate fully how big their task is. Between 1990, when the multi-government negotiations for a climate treaty started in earnest, and 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated, I had the dubious privilege of watching Exxon and its collaborators from the front row, as an environmental lobbyist at the talks. I wrote the only eye-witness account of the history of the climate negotiations that exists, to my knowledge (The Carbon War, Penguin 1999). In it, I describe how the \"carbon club\" - the network of coal, oil and other fossil-fuel-related industry umbrella groups at the climate talks - goes about its work. Throughout the long run-up to Kyoto, the carbon club consistently distorted the science, and on several occasions plumbed scarcely credible depths of misinformation and manipulation in its efforts to derail the climate convention. I list the main episodes below. Given the stakes if society fails to stem greenhouse-gas emissions - casualties measured in hundreds of millions if the best estimates of government climatologists are correct - I argue in The Carbon War that this campaign amounted to a new form of crime against humanity. For most of the period described in the book, I was a climate campaigner. Since January 1997 I have been running a solar energy company, during which time I have only rarely witnessed first hand the carbon club going about its insidious work. But I have read regular accounts of their behaviour in the press. There is one big difference, though, between 1996 and 2006. BP, Shell, Texaco and the others have long since quit the club of climate-treaty wreckers in shame. Exxon-Mobil - as it now is post-merger - plays on, unreformed. Note the first line of the list that follows, and the last. A CATALOGUE OF CARBON CLUB MANIPULATION, DISTORTION, SABOTAGE OR LYING AT THE CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS. Unless otherwise stated, all episodes were witnessed by the author. Specific accusation and outcome are in italics. • May 1990, Bracknell, UK: Exxon's lead climate lobbyist, Brian Flannery, attempts to water down the first IPCC scientific assessment report, the report which forced governments into the climate negotiations. (Attempted manipulation: unsuccessful) • August 1990, Sundsvaal, Sweden: Don Pearlman of the World Climate Council, a key carbon club organisation, openly coaches the Saudi Arabian delegation to the final IPCC plenary before the World Climate Conference. The Saudis deploy stalling tactics as a device to water down the IPCC's summary report, (attempted sabotage: partially successful), including a laughable concerted effort to excise the words \"carbon dioxide\" from the document (manipulation: partially successful). • February 1992, New York: The Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobby group representing Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Shell, BP, and many other oil, coal, and auto companies, uses professional sceptic Fred Singer to attack the IPCC science at a press conference during the fifth session of negotiations (INC 5). The GCC issues a briefing entitled \"stabilising carbon dioxide emissions would have little environmental benefit.\" (Distortion: outcome unknowable). Exxon's Flannery, Pearlman of the WCC, and GCC chief John Schlaes are constantly in each others' company at the talks. • June 1992, Rio de Janeiro: At the Earth Summit, with heads of state signing the newly negotiated Convention on Climate Change by the dozen, the GCC stages a press conference which lays out a central carbon club wrecking strategy for the years to come. Executive Director John Schlaes leads a concerted effort to emphasise the growing emissions of developing countries, preparing the way for a sustained attack by the carbon club on the soft underbelly of the Convention, which ultimately led to long-running deadlock in the build-up to the Kyoto climate summit. (Manipulation; ultimately unsuccessful) • May 1993, Barcelona: Bush Administration climate negotiator Harlan Watson lavishes praise on Pearlman and Schlaes at an international coal industry conference, warning the industry that it is gravely threatened because of the Convention on Climate Change, and exhorting them to work with the carbon club to defend their industry. At the 2005 Climate Summit in Montreal, Watson is the lead US negotiator for George Bush Junior. • September 1993, New York: On the same day that the President of the Reinsurance Association of America tells an international insurance conference near Wall Street that global warming could bankrupt the insurance industry, Fred Singer writes in the New York Times that \"as observations and theory diverge more strongly with each passing year, it becomes more certain there is something very wrong with the computer models that have been used to scare the world public and their governments into considering drastic, hasty actions.\" This is part of a renewed assault by the carbon club on climate science, aiming to head off the potential for progressive moves by the Clinton Administration. \"Conservatives and industry groups,\" the New York Times writes, \"have mounted a renewed assault on the idea that global warming is a serious and possibly catastrophic threat. In a drum roll of criticism over the last few months they have characterised the thesis of global warming as a flash in the pan,' hysteria,' scare talk,' and a ploy by socialists to justify controls on the economy.\" • August 1994, Geneva: At the 10th session of negotiations, the largest-ever carbon club presence carries a twin-pronged attack on science and competitiveness. \"To date,\" John Schlaes wrote in a Global Climate Coalition submission, \"science has been unable to establish what qualifies as a dangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations. This makes a judgement on the adequacy of commitments logically impossible.\" (Misrepresentation tantamount to distortion: effect unknowable). • September 1994, Geneva: Don Pearlman reportedly orchestrates an emasculation of a key IPCC report. Environment groups send a letter to the co-chair of the IPCC's policy responses working group, copied to every key IPCC official and many heads of national delegations, alleging that an IPCC meeting in Geneva had produced a draft policymakers summary which had been systematically amended in such a way as to remove most of its key policy conclusions. By and large, the letter alleges, the amendments and deletions to this text had been made in response to the objections of only one or two countries and of only a few industry lobbyists. (Manipulation: successful) • February 1995, New York: At the 11th session of negotiations, the GCC releases a study by a weather consultancy, Accu-Weather, which claims that there was no convincing observational evidence that extremes of temperature and rainfall were on the rise. The temperature claim was based on three supposedly \"representative\" stations, all in the USA, and the precipitation claim - incredibly - was based on just one station. As though one, or three, stations could represent the whole USA. As though the USA could represent the whole world. A press conference for the print media goes badly, reportedly, when the journalists learn what the analysis is based on, but still significant damage is done via unquestioning television and radio news. (Distortion - disinformation at its very worst: partially successful) • March 1995, Washington and Berlin: The Global Climate Coalition tries to bully the President of the Reinsurance Association of America into not attending the Berlin Climate Summit to discuss the financial sector's emerging concerns about global warming. (Attempted manipulation: unsuccessful) • March/April 1995, Berlin: At the Berlin Climate Summit, Der Spiegel reporters investigate Don Pearlman, and trap \"the high priest of the carbon club,\" as they call him, in a lie. A Dutch climatologist tells them about the tampering Pearlman has organised, via the Kuwaitis, in the IPCC process. At a critical meeting, the Kuwaitis evidently tried to submit amendments, in Pearlman's own handwriting, of otherwise undisputed statements. And at a vital late night session of talks in New York in February, where the carbon club had so blatantly ferried instructions to the OPEC delegations that UN officials had told the lobbyists to quit the negotiating chamber. Pearlman denied to Der Spiegel that such a thing happened. A UN official confirmed it, on record. (Lying: unsuccessful) • November 1995, Madrid: At the final plenary of the IPCC scientific working group, as the crucial policymakers summary of the Second IPCC Assessment is drafted, Don Pearlman - a non-scientist - overtly issues instructions to oil-ministry officials from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (also non-scientists). So blatant is the manipulation, that one senior US climatologist asks if he can have his name removed from the final report. • June 1996: The Global Climate Coalition orchestrates a campaign to discredit Ben Santer, a lead author of the Second IPCC Assessment. Santer had altered the text of the draft to reflect changes agreed in Madrid - as requested by the meeting. The GCC sought to cast this as scientific fraud, saying \"the changes quite clearly have the obvious political purpose of cleansing the underlying scientific report.\" The IPCC's leadership point out that Santer was merely following agreed procedures. (Distortion: outcome unknowable). • October 1997: Exxon is prominent in a US Chamber of Commerce campaign to derail the Kyoto Protocol by casting it as a document that lets the developing world off any commitments on greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile Exxon's boss Lee Raymond tells the Chinese at the World Petroleum Congress in Beijing that attempts to curtail fossil fuel use were \"neither prudent nor practical.\" Despite all these efforts to derail the climate talks, the Kyoto Protocol was finally negotiated at an all-night session involving most of the world's governments in December 1997. The treaty then had to be ratified by a critical mass of governments in order to come into force. Exxon-Mobil campaigned on, trying to delay the inevitable as much as they could. Some key events since then have been: • January 2000: World Economic Forum (2,000 + CEOs) votes global warming No. 1 issue of concern to global business. • February 2000: Texaco quits the Global Climate Coalition: 1st US oil company to break ranks. BP quit in 1997 and Shell not long thereafter. • June 2000: Exxon-Mobil CEO denies link between oil burning and global warming at AGM. BP rebrands as \"Beyond Petroleum.\" Worldwide advertising campaign stresses solar and downplays oil. • January 2001: Global Climate Coalition winds up, saying Bush presidency means they are no longer needed. • February 2001: Oil companies face a record number of shareholder resolutions on global warming at AGMs. • March 2001: America pulls out of Kyoto Protocol. • November 2001: Governments vote in Marrakech to continue the Kyoto Protocol process without the USA. • May 2003: Exxon backing for climate sceptic groups exposed. Exxon CEO tells AGM profits come before \"social statements\" • February 2005: The Kyoto Protocol comes into force, finally, after Russia ratify it despite Exxon-Mobil pressure not to. • June 2005: ExxonMobil takes out obscure ads saying \"the world faces enormous challenges\" on energy and environment. • July 2005: Exxon CEO calls solar and wind energy \"inconsequential\" and says it will never meet needs. • December 2005: US forced to retreat on Kyoto. At the Montreal climate summit, outrage greets Bush's effort to stop future talks. Exxon's long-standing lobbyist, Brian Flannery, is there on the International Chamber of Commerce delegation, to help Harlan Watson and his colleagues from the Bush administration out if they are needed. Flannery presumably doesn't have to work so hard in 2005 and 2006 as he did in 1990."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2005/jul/22/g2.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2005-07-21T23:02:58Z","webTitle":"Just70","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/jul/22/g2.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2005/jul/22/g2.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"Just70","bodyText":"So is this it, then, global warming? Have the advance publicity, the dire warnings, the environmental polemics finally come to this ... a sequence of days so blisteringly hot that the sweat dripped into the keyboard, the ice tray needed constant replenishing, the windows were opened wide at the cool extremities of the day and curtains, shutters and blinds closed as for noontide in the Mediterranean? I grew up at a time when the nature of our weather was a given. And growing up near Manchester, that \"given\" usually meant rain. We studied world climates as though they were permanent fixtures, the Sahara an aberrant stretch of sand, the Amazon forest an eternal and inviolable spread of forest. Rivers rose and fell, so we learned about estuaries and deltas. Mountain ranges would be perpetual snow, the poles likewise, places where recklessly brave individuals would battle the elements for national glory. But we expected the elements to stay the same. Not that we didn't experience extremes of weather. The winter of 1947 was exceptionally hard. Every Box Brownie in the land recorded the depth of snowfalls, mum and dad wielding spades to dig out the garden gate and, if you had one, the precious car. Ink froze in the inkwells - there was no central heating. But there were compensations: local pools froze solid and everyone took to their skates; in Oxford, people skated along the river; in Windsor, you could cross on a bicycle. In the school playground, we polished tracks of ice to a glass-like finish and then slid along them at a frantic pace. Laughter rose bright and brittle in the crisp air. A decade later I recall peasoupers, grey-green fogs so dense you struggled to see your hand in front of your face. In 1952, there was a four-day peasouper that, it is claimed, killed 4,000 Londoners. I remember in the mid-50s we had somehow got ourselves to Sadler's Wells and when our bus home found itself on the pavement and up against a shop window, we knew it was time to disembark and grope our own way back to Hampstead. In 1956, the Clean Air Act imposed smokeless zones on inner cities, sulphur dioxide was reduced and we began to see the sky. Such brief episodes of exceptional weather were considered just that: exceptional. Not any more. Now what is happening is seen as part of a bigger story; consistent climate change at an accelerating rate. We're told there has been more change in the condition of the earth in the past 20 years than in the previous 200, and in those 200 years more than in the previous 2,000. As the experts roll out the numerous ways we're all going to have to adjust, I can see that being older has its advantages. The era of cheap airfares will come to an end, but the old seem to prefer cruises. There's bound to be a big push against those ghastly 4x4s, but I don't have to transport children any more, and the macho image does me no favours. I might even swap my Toyota Selica for the electric-and-petrol hybrid Toyota Prius. I won't have a guilty conscience about idling my way across Europe. Travelling more slowly may come back into fashion. Cities will have to have designated cycle lanes before I venture out on a bicycle, but I'm well aware that walking further would help keep me nimble. Perhaps it's time to try the pilgrims' path to Santiago de Compostela. Otherwise, in Britain, the senior rail card and the freedom pass that lets me travel by bus and tube entirely free in London will come in helpful. I quite enjoy chatting to the stallholders at the local farmers' market, so perhaps I can wean myself off those polished and flawless vegetables flown in from Spain and Israel, and buy locally. When it comes to downsizing my house, I could well choose somewhere on high ground - away from the floods - and try installing solar energy. Yes, the life changes that come with age will play well with the green agenda. The psychology's right, too. When I was young and eager I wanted to grab and hold as much as I could of what life had to offer. It needed considerable effort and a sense of frantic activity to travel, read, work and play as much as I wanted to. Somehow, the urgency of that enthusiasm wanes. Better to enjoy at a slower pace - and perhaps greater depth - the pleasures that endure. Old age is about making fewer demands on yourself ... and also, it could be, on the planet. joan.bakewell@virgin.net"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2005/jun/11/environment.greenpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2005-06-11T08:30:12Z","webTitle":"Blair tries for elusive climate change deal to shore up plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/11/environment.greenpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2005/jun/11/environment.greenpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Blair tries for elusive climate change deal to shore up plans","bodyText":"Tony Blair will seek an elusive Europe-wide consensus on a framework to limit climate change when he undertakes a four-nation tour to shore up his plans for a breakthrough on the issue at the G8 summit in Gleneagles next month. Downing Street confirmed yesterday that on Monday he will be visiting Vladimir Putin in Russia as well as the German chancellor, Gerhardt Schröder, in Berlin. On Tuesday he will hold talks with the French president, Jacques Chirac, in Paris and Jean Claude Juncker in Luxembourg, the current holder of the EU presidency. Mr Blair will seek to separate his G8 agenda issues of climate change and Africa from the row over the future of Europe during the tour. Officials said he believed the EU crisis should be discussed in other forums, but realistically the two agendas will intersect. Mr Blair believes he needs to do a lot more to secure a climate change agreement that the US would endorse. He admitted to MPs this week that any plan that lacked US support was largely worthless. Washington has refused to sing the Kyoto protocol setting targets for CO2 emissions. The US has proposed \"carbon intensity targets\", in which countries reduce the amount of carbon emitted for every dollar of gross domestic product. The administration has also set itself a target of an 18% improvement on this measure by 2012. But critics say these targets are voluntary and do not guarantee cuts in emissions. By contrast, Russia, the first stop on Mr Blair's tour, belatedly signed the Kyoto protocol last November, but the terms put little pressure on the world's third largest polluter to cut emissions. Russia is deemed in transition and free from any serious obligations. With the US determined not to sign up to Kyoto, Mr Blair needs to find a forum in which the US, Russia and developing countries such as China and India can be brought together. The US rejected the Kyoto agreement because it did not include the developing nations. The protocol ends in 2012 and experts nominated by more than 100 governments met in Bonn last month on the first lap of negotiations for a new deal. Yet Mr Blair needs some major commitment from the Russians, since many western economies will be dependent on Russian energy in the future. Imports from the increasingly undemocratic Russia already make up 26% of gas consumption in the EU and 25% of oil. President Putin is seeking technology deals with the west as part of the energy links. Mr Blair will find a more ready audience on climate change in Berlin later on Monday. The Germans have been leading the way on renewable energy and have been working with both the US and China to sign energy efficiency technology agreements. The German environment minister, Jürgen Trittin, has already said the Kyoto target-and-trade system \"has proved successful\". He has called for its continuation, with tougher emission cuts of 15% to 30% - up to six times existing targets - to be met by industrialised nations by 2020. But others have said it will be easier to persuade the remaining Kyoto opt-outs such as the US and Australia, and developing countries such as China, India and Brazil, to accept targets if they are not based on cuts in national emissions. The Germans have reached agreement to help the Chinese to reach an ambitious goal of generating 10% of electricity from water, wind, biomass and solar energy by 2010. The share is to be doubled to 20% by 2020. The Germans, unlike the US, are phasing out nuclear power, an issue on which Mr Blair may come to differ with Berlin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2004/sep/02/greenpolitics.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2004-09-02T17:20:49Z","webTitle":"Solar power sucked into funding 'black hole'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/sep/02/greenpolitics.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2004/sep/02/greenpolitics.politics","fields":{"headline":"Solar power sucked into funding 'black hole'","bodyText":"The fledgling British solar industry faces an uncertain future because of a \"black hole\" in government support, an environmental group warned today. Friends of the Earth said two key government funding programmes aimed at boosting solar energy in the UK are to be wound down earlier than planned, with little clarity as to what will follow. \"Companies face a black hole in support and a huge degree of uncertainty... This uncertainty is already making future investment, job recruitment and new product development planning impossible and is sending all the wrong signals to the market,\" the group said. Friends of the Earth urged the government instead to extend the two schemes, offering grants and advice. Although a new scheme to replace the current programmes has been proposed, considerable doubt exists over how much will be given to solar power. \"While Tony Blair stands on the world stage, championing the fight against climate change, the UK's domestic solar power industry is under threat because of a lack of government funding,\" said Catherine Pearce, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \"The prime minister must put his money where his mouth is.\" The department of trade and industry (DTI) dismissed the accusation that it was ending the two funding programmes for solar energy as speculation. \"We are an island and try to capitalise on the best resources we have, which is wind and wave,\" a DTI official said. \"We just announced £25m in funding for solar power in early summer, and we have not yet made any funding decisions on renewables for the next round.\" But the very fact that the government has yet to take a decision on funding for solar power was criticised by the industry. Industry officials said the government needed to make decisions now to ensure that there is continuity in funding after next March. \"It sends a hugely damaging signal not just to UK but international firms looking to invest in solar energy,\" said Seb Berry of the Renewable Power Association, an umbrella organisation for renewable energy companies. \"The industry is so concerned because firms have made decision s to invest based on what the government has said through ministers' statements and policy papers only to find that the government has now moved the goal posts.\" The UK lags behind many countries in Europe and the rest of the world in solar power technologies - despite the government's stated commitment to renewable energy. California is proposing to add solar power to 1m homes within the next 10 years, while 150MW of solar PV was installed in Germany last year, and 200MW is expected to be installed in 2004. On 12 separate occasions since 1999, the German programme has delivered the equivalent of the UK's three-year target in just one month. So far, the UK has installed 6MW and may have trouble meeting its target of 9MW - or the approximate equivalent of 3,000 domestic roofs - by next year. The government's lukewarm approach to solar energy can be attributed to its belief that there is limited scope for solar power because of Britain's climate. The government believes that wind power holds the most promise and has devoted most of the funds for renewable energy to windfarms. The government has said it wants 5% of the UK's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources next year, 10% by 2010 and 20% by 2020. But most renewable energy experts believe that Britain will miss those targets. Renewable energy sources in the UK currently provide 3.86% of the total electricity supply. Despite the dire warnings from Friends of the Earth, not everyone in the solar industry took as bleak a view. Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of Solarcentury, Britain's largest independent solar energy company, said: \"We fully expect the government to maintain course with its current market enablement activities in solar PV. \"It would be crazy to create a dynamic, fast growing, award-winning embryonic industry, completely consistent with its energy white paper, and then let it whither on the vine. We expect a positive announcement in due course. Having said this, we very much agree with FoE's point about the difficulty of business planning and financing in such a climate of unnecessary uncertainty.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2005/apr/28/5","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2005-04-27T23:03:19Z","webTitle":"Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/apr/28/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2005/apr/28/5","fields":{"headline":"Letters","bodyText":"A power of alternatives to oil Stories similar to yours have been spooking the kids for generations (The beginning of the end, April 21). Fossil fuels are the legacy of hundreds of millions of years of stored solar energy, and our coal reserves will outlast life on this abundant planet, which is a ball of minerals and energy. Australia's coal resources run deep and wide. Using them at current rates is akin to bailing out Sydney Harbour with a bucket. John McRobert Brisbane, Australia · One unwelcome consequence of oil depletion will be a boost to the nuclear power lobby. As solar power and wind farms won't suffice by a long shot, and wave power has been neglected, nuclear will be the only credible alternative. The added attraction of consuming energy that doesn't emit greenhouse gases will make it more inevitable. The only answer that doesn't involve building hundreds of nuclear power stations is to cut down radically on consumption, not a popular stance to take. Daniel Nucinkis Southampton · Colin Campbell may be right that oil production will soon peak, but the world's vast reserves of coal will last us over a thousand years. Coal can be converted to gas, and then to liquid fuels, such as petrol, via the well-established Fisher-Tropsch process. Michael Peck Elizabeth Bay, Australia · What is astonishing is how little comprehension there is of our proximity to the economic abyss. Economists blandly suggest that when oil becomes expensive \"new technologies will be developed\". They have no conception of the three laws of thermodynamics, and the extent of the astonishing bounty that has been deposited for us in fossil fuels. My children will definitely live to see a post-petroleum world. What will it be like? I shudder to think. Graham Leggett University of Sheffield Write on Methinks the associate professor doth protest too much (Not in my name, April 21). To make a blanket criticism of busy scientific opinion-leaders or industry sponsors merely because preparatory work is done by lesser mortals is naive at best and disingenuous at worst. The fact that Fugh-Berman refused to author a paper which was too fully formed before being offered for authorship proves that the system works and that wise authors will not be \"spoon-fed\". In any case, the practice she speaks of no longer happens in any company such as AstraZeneca or GlaxoSmithKline operating good publications practice. Articles appearing in scientific journals, or in the pages of the Guardian for that matter, are in all cases better judged on their content than their provenance. If the former is robust and honest, the latter hardly matters. Peter Crespin The Writers Bureau, Buxton, Derbyshire Daylight snobbery It is impossible to argue against much of Tim Lott's argument regarding novelists who avoid science (Literary friction, April 21). But while it is useful in some cases to consider science fiction as a genre, immediately to refer in contrast to \"real writers\" is misleading. SF is simply something that writers engaged with the idea of science as a subject of storytelling do. Science in fiction is a spectrum between writers who consider science and technology as areas in which they can describe the world of today, and writers who extrapolate from current sciences to explore their implications, often developing imaginative, futuristic worlds. In arguing against literary snobbery, Lott is still using the boundaries constructed by the snobs.

The Harrall family's four-bedroom, self-built house is packed into the earth, has a planted roof, vegetable garden and energy consumption a quarter of that of an ordinary house of the same size. Jerry Harrall describes his single-storey, Teletubby-esque home as \"earth-sheltered\". \"This building is a response to global climate change,\" he says. \"Our whole lifestyle is a response to that.\" Harrall is not an atavistic type who yearns for the return of barter and hazel benders. In fact, he is a competitive cyclist and has built a gym in his garden. It is served, like the rest of his house, by solar-generated electricity. When Harrall left school at 16, he became a plasterer, before retraining as an architect. \"I'm on a journey of discovery,\" he says. \"I've decided to make a difference in my life.\" He and his wife, Kay Woods, who have been together since they were 15, had to live with their children in a caravan on site during the build. It took almost four years. \"It was tough,\" says Woods, stoically, \"particularly when the weather was bad. Anyone who's done a self-build has been through it.\" Their home is in Long Sutton, a town in south Lincolnshire with an air of past importance, whose church has the tallest wooden spire in Europe. It does not seem given to innovation - a recently installed hi-tech bus shelter was so reviled that two residents chained themselves to it in protest - but at the end of its eastwards straggle lie bungalows, a derelict petrol station, then the home of Harrall and family: on the same site as the offices of his architecture firm SEArch (Sustainable Ecological Architecture). Unobtrusive to the point of invisibility from the road, there's a big hedge, a gravel area, then the two buildings, which are the performance part of Harrall's PhD at the University of Lincoln - his aim being to prove the long-term value of passive solar design, where buildings absorb and retain heat. Harrall's buildings have no foundations - just concrete blocks placed on the floor, rooted by gravity. His home's earth roof is covered by a woven membrane to keep it in place, and I notice that the periwinkles planted to cover it are slightly sparse, having succumbed to a disease. We enter via raised wooden walkways. The initial effect is a bit like a field studies centre, and I'm still unsure until I get around the back - or rather the front - where the south-facing facade opens like a flower to pick up as much solar energy and heat as possible. \"In the past, buildings were oriented towards the sun,\" says Harrall, lamenting that this elementary building wisdom is now generally ignored. The house is reminiscent of the grass-topped bothies in Nordic climates. \"Among my favourite buildings are those at Skara Brae in the Orkneys, the oldest known dwellings in the British Isles,\" says Harrall. \"They're built into crags, face south, and had sod roofs. What we're doing is not that new.\" The bricks in the walls make use of reclaimed materials: a mix of concrete and pulverised fuel ash and woodchip. A solar panel on the roof heats the water, but the family does take electricity from the grid - on a green tariff. Harrall is planning to install a wind turbine later this year to take them to full self-sufficiency. The kitchen walls are clad with aluminium, which looks dramatic - but Harrall isn't entirely happy. \"It's the only metal that is truly recyclable, but I wouldn't use it again as it marks.\" Also mildly industrial is the larder, with its door of clear rubber blinds. The effect is fastidious, even austere. There are no pendant lights, for instance: \"We only have task lighting.\" The house has no skirting boards, lintels, drainpipes or radiators. The walls are painted rather than rendered, for which there is a good thermodynamic reason. \"We expose the bricks to achieve a high thermal mass,\" Harrall explains. \"In other words, the structure acts as a storage radiator, helping avoid extreme variations in internal temperature.\" The house is filled with wooden furniture by local maker Deryk Gilham. He shares Harrall's passion for recycling and sourcing local materials, including bog oak - wood that fell into fenland swamps several thousand years ago and has an extraordinary, infinite black colour. The house is clearly Harrall's passion. So how does his wife feel about it? \"I'm spoiled for light and space, which is uplifting,\" she says. \"We consider living here normal now. But I still notice when going to other houses how noisy they are. People often tell me how quiet it is here.\" Though light floods into the wide facade of the house, what about the back, which is buried under a bank of earth? Here, Harrall has placed the 10m corridor which connects the four bedrooms and bathroom. This corridor receives secondary light , filtering into the bedrooms from the garden through shot-blasted glass doors. Harrall's next project is that derelict petrol station on the other side of the road which he hopes will be Europe's first earth-sheltered field studies centre, with a range of buildings to spread the low-emission message. Perhaps we should call it Little Carbon. · SEArch, 01406 364646. You can see Deryk Gilham's furniture at Bonhams from August 6-14.

Their enthusiasm pointed to a renewed appetite for media and IT stocks after the collapse of the Neuer Markt more than three years ago. Premiere, majority owned by British private equity firm Permira until the flotation, said the initial public offering was 12 times oversubscribed and set its price at €28 - the top end of the €24-€28 range set last month - valuing the group at €2.3bn (£1.6bn) The success of yesterday's float, which saw Premiere shares trading at more than €31, suggested to analysts that IPOs planned for this year from solar energy company Conergy and aero-engines group MTU could pave the way for the float next year of coal and chemicals group RAG in a move worth up to €7bn to government coffers. Premiere, which rose out of the ashes of the collapsed Kirch media empire, lost €1.3bn in 2001 but last year returned to the black for the first time, posting pre-tax earnings of €83m. Offering live sports programmes such as the current round of Champions League soccer and formula one, it has 3.25 million subscribers. Georg Kofler, the chief executive, who brought Kirch's ProSieben to market, is credited with turning the firm around and saw his 20% stake diluted to just under 14%. He said Premiere was now a genuine public company, with 51% of the equity in free float. Permira, which bought the firm for an undisclosed sum in 2003, cuts its stake to 23.6% while creditor banks, which acquired holdings then, saw their stakes cut to below 10%. Some analysts worry that the group's prospects are less rosy than those of BSkyB, for instance, because of its more limited programming - especially the reliance on sport, but Mr Kofler insisted sales would top €1bn this year - which is growth of more than 10%. The chief executive, who wooed private investors with a series of posters and television ads, giving them 30% of the 42m shares on offer, said the net proceeds of about €300m would be used to virtually clear outstanding debt of €370m. The float came amid speculation that Springer, the German media group, would launch a full-scale bid for ProSiebenSat.1, the country's biggest domestic commercial broadcaster. Springer holds 12%.

Although the UK has invested £25m in solar power - £9m this year - only 10 megawatts of such electricity was produced in 2003, about the same as the output of a small wind farm and only 1% of that produced by the Sizewell nuclear power station, in Suffolk. Lamenting Britain's slow adoption of solar energy, Peter Hain, the secretary for Wales, argued this month that every new home should, by law, be fitted with photovoltaic panels to produce solar electricity. However, Mr Hain's suggestions, like his proposed panels, are unlikely to see the light of day as the government sees limited potential for solar energy in the UK. A review of innovation in renewable published this year by the department for trade and industry and the Carbon Trust, a group that promotes low carbon use, said: \"Current technology solar PV [photovoltaic] installation is expensive under UK conditions. There may be a future breakthrough in solar PV technologies which could substantially reduce costs, advancing the point at which solar PV is an economical technology under UK conditions. However, the breakthrough and extent of impact are highly uncertain.\" The government's position receives some support from John Mogford, head of BP's gas, power and renewables division. Too diplomatic to say that Mr Hain is full of hot air, he still makes it plain that he thinks the minister is being unrealistic. \"Solar plays different roles in different countries,\" he told Guardian Unlimited, in an interview at BP's headquarters in St James Square in London. \"Even in the US, it's different state by state. Every government should have different policies depending on climatic conditions.\" Mr Mogford is referring, of course, to Britain's lack of sun. But Britain does have plenty of wind. The UK has more wind off its coasts than anywhere else in Europe, and the government believes that windpower holds considerable promise. Developers have entered into agreements for leasing windfarm sites around the coast with a total capacity of at least 1,400 megawatts of renewable energy, sufficient to power a city the size of Greater Manchester. Whichever source the government favours, the UK produces less renewable electricity - be it sun, wind or hydro - than several other large European countries. In 2000, renewables (excluding large hydro plant and mixed waste incineration) supplied only 1.3% of Britain's electricity. That compared with 16.7% in Denmark, 4% in the Netherlands, 3.2% in Germany and 3.4% in Spain. Notwithstanding its poor record, the Blair government has set itself the target of producing 10% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2010, a goal that many environmental groups think is unattainable at the present pace. As Mr Mogford explains, a big hurdle for the UK is that it has a highly developed grid system, one of the world's most advanced, and cheap electricity. Mr Mogford compares renewables to mobile phones. If a country had no land lines, it would make sense to go straight to mobile phones and skip the huge investment in fixed lines. Similarly, it would be advantageous for a country without a highly developed power grid system to sink resources into solar energy. But in the UK, the incremental cost of adding another power station to the grid is less than putting money into a renewable source such as solar power. For the consumer, a typical household system with solar panels costs between £8,000 and £30,000. It would provide approximately 35% of a home's electricity needs, saving around £100 in electricity bills a year. Those numbers are not going to create a stampede for solar panels - although government grants can offset 50% of the costs. Nevertheless, the global market for solar energy is growing rapidly. BP Solar, which is part of BP's gas, power and renewables division, and is the world's largest manufacturer in terms of production of solar-electric products, had revenues of $300m (£162m) last year and is growing fast. Sales are growing by 20% a year and BP Solar plans to double its capacity this year, from new plants and by adding capacity at existing plants. The company's production has grown from 34 megawatts in 1999 to 75 megawatts in 2003. Mr Mogford said BP Solar aims to reach $1bn in revenue by 2007-08. It all sounds very impressive until you remember that BP's total revenue last year was $232bn. In the 1990s, the market for solar-electric products, such as panels, was mostly for off-grid power in the developing world. But as more governments in the rich countries have brought in incentives for renewable energy, a bigger market has grown, minimising the risks for companies. So if the German market slows down, there are now other markets to pick up the slack. Japan has a well-developed market for renewable energy, and the biggest makers of solar panels are Japanese - Sharp and Kyocera. It is, however, a tough market to crack because of strong indigenous competition. On the other hand, BP Solar sees strong growth in Spain and Portugal in the next few years. \"As governments have introduced incentives, people are now making investment decisions based on many markets,\" Mr Mogford. BP has come under fire for not pushing ahead faster on solar energy and renewables, an argument with which Mr Mogford is familiar. \"Yes we could do more if we spent as much on renewables as on oil,\" he says. \"But we'd also be broke.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2005/feb/03/europeanunion","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2005-02-03T00:03:41Z","webTitle":"EC call for centre of technological excellence in the MIT mould","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/03/europeanunion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2005/feb/03/europeanunion","fields":{"headline":"EC call for centre of technological excellence in the MIT mould","bodyText":"The European Union should set up its own institute of technology to rival the United States's MIT, which has inspired more than 4,000 companies and won 59 Nobel prizes since it was set up in 1865, the European commission proposed yesterday. The proposal was one of 40 \"flagship actions\" put forward by Jose Manuel Barroso, president, and Günter Verheugen, vice-president, to revive the EU's sagging \"Lisbon\" strategy of making the EU the world's most dynamic knowledge-based economy. The aim is to recreate the legendary Massachussets Institute of Technology, home to 900 faculty members and 10,000 students, on European soil - preferably in a new member state, probably Poland, according to Mr Barroso. It would \"act as a pole of attraction for the very best minds, ideas and companies from around the world\" the commission said, and would be part publicly, part privately funded, with offshoots in other EU countries. MIT, which gets 70% of its funding from the US government and 20% from private investors, is concentrating on new areas of research such as neuroscience, bio-engineering, sustainable development, new media and financial technology after pioneering the first chemical synthesis of penicillin and digital computers among other innovations. The commission proposal, designed to help to meet the target of spending 3% of EU gross domestic product on research and development compared with the current 2% and close a €120bn (£83bn) gap with the United States, is accompanied by British-style plans to fund research into and set up technology initiatives in areas such as hydrogen technolgy and solar energy. These, designed to \"tackle market failure and to advance concrete product or service developments\", would be handled through public-private partnerships, but they would eschew the model of a state-backed \"agency for industrial innovation\" backed by French president Jacques Chirac. A European Research Council, sitting alongside and on top of national bodies and composed of independent scientists, would choose projects and programmes to be funded by the EU and attract private investment. These and other unashamedly pro-business measures would come under national action plans which would be overseen, at cabinet level, by a \"Mr/Ms Lisbon,\" a minister charged with ensuring that each of the 25 member states achieved the goals of raising annual growth to 3% and creating 6m jobs by the end of the decade.

The plan, proposed by the California Environmental Protection Agency, is intended to honour the election pledge of California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to ensure that half of all new homes in the state are built with solar power facilities. The surcharge would raise $1bn (about £570m) in 10 years for the installation programme, with the state using the money to give rebates to home builders who install solar panels on new homes, and incentives for installing panels on existing homes. Homeowners would be able to reduce their power bills and even make money by selling \"unused\" solar energy back to the electricity companies via two-way meters. Electricity supply has been a sensitive issue since the energy crisis in 2001 when a free-for-all market pushed prices so low that many stations shut down leaving the state short of power. Solar power became more popular. According to the California Energy Commission, while 900 photovoltaic systems were installed from 1998 to 2000, more than 11,000 systems were installed from 2001 to mid-2003. Most of the changes were to older properties, but with 150,000 new homes being built a year the greater potential led to a campaign for the state to use its \"greatest asset\" - sunshine. Tim Coyle, the senior vice president of the California Building Industry Association, said home solar systems could cost from $17,000-20,000 (£9,714-£11,428) and did not pay for themselves as customers would typically pay $120 a month to repay the purchase price and receive about $70 in \"returns\" in electricity generated. The state grants are designed to make the system pay. According to the draft plan, presented by Drew Bohan, under-secretary of the EPA, \"each month the homeowner will save more money in reduced electricity charges than [will be paid] on the solar mortgage\". Environmental groups said the proposal would once again make California a national trendsetter while encouraging technical advances that would help make solar power more affordable worldwide. \"This is so far ahead of any other state ... there's no comparison,\" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, of the group Environment California. Together the solar installations would equal 36 new, 75-megawatt natural gas plants, and would avoid adding 50m tons of carbon dioxide into the air annually. The incentives should be enough to get solar panels on 40% of new homes by 2010 and 50% by 2013, the EPA believes. The hope is that 1.2m homes will be producing solar energy by 2017, including 884,000 new and 313,000 older houses. Mr Schwarzenegger has yet to endorse the plan publicly, despite the election pledge. Ms Del Chiaro said: \"My hope is the governor comes out even stronger by increasing the incentives and mandates, and applying the requirements to commercial buildings as well. There's no guarantee builders will take advantage of incentives, though [they] are great.\" Many environmentalists are also backing solar home incentives. A solar incentive bill, approved by the California senate, would require 15% of new homes to be built with solar panels by 2006. By 2010 more than half of homes would come equipped with solar systems. The building industry opposes the solar homes bill but said the proposed incentives were the way to encourage technological and economic improvements that will make widespread use of solar energy more realistic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2005/mar/21/research.science","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2005-03-21T10:03:23Z","webTitle":"Top-level study of rainforests' secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/21/research.science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2005/mar/21/research.science","fields":{"headline":"Top-level study of rainforests' secrets","bodyText":"British-based scientists are aiming to occupy the high ground of biology.

Almost 90% of the earth's biomass - the sheer weight of life - is in the forests.

The programme has just received backing from the United Nations environment chiefs and five governments. Forests are powerful players in the carbon cycle, and have a huge role in the global warming theatre. If all goes to plan, the first five cranes will tower over the rainforests, swinging a research platform and instruments over the treetops, observing the foliage, flowers, birds, insects, epiphytes, parasites, reptiles and mammals in life's upper storeys, ideally without snapping a branch or disturbing a nest. Researchers will measure volatile compounds from the foliage, monitor the interaction between plants and atmosphere, and watch for omens of change triggered by global warming. Canopies are delicate environments. They are - at least from underneath - also dark places. Dr Mitchell first began high-altitude biology looking for gibbons in Borneo in 1978. \"I couldn't see them, because they were so high up in the trees and this was very frustrating, and I thought, well, if we could get up there and study the forest canopy maybe we could learn more about their lives.\" He began by building a series of aerial walkways. He and other scientists have experimented with hot-air balloons, and even a dirigible. More than 20 years of canopy science has convinced biologists that they need literally to get on top of the subject. \"It is in the canopies that trees pass their genes around. This is where they produce flowers and fruits. It is where the sun's energy is beating down. It is where the forest meets the sky and as a result it is the most energy rich part of the forest,\" he says. \"The great thing about a canopy crane is that, with a helicopter, you can slide the crane down in between the trees without causing any damage. It stands on a concrete plinth that you do have to build but it doesn't have to be very big. It is simple technology, used every day in our towns. No other system allows you to get to that much forest, day after day, year after year.\" The crane and gondola can deliver researchers to any point in almost a hectare of forest, from the highest fronds almost to the ground. Research at canopy level will be matched by remote sensing from space, and instrument readings at the forest floor. \"The great thing is we have the backing of the United Nations environment programme and the backing of five important national governments,\" said Dr Mitchell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2005/feb/07/worlddispatch.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2005-02-07T16:38:48Z","webTitle":"On thin ice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/feb/07/worlddispatch.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2005/feb/07/worlddispatch.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"On thin ice","bodyText":"The Kyoto accord on global warming takes effect next week, and the heat is on Prime Minister Paul Martin and his Liberal government to produce a plan for meeting Canada's international obligations. The Liberal government did very little on the global warming file for years, perhaps hoping the agreement would die before it had to make any hard decisions about how to curb the use of oil and gas in Canada. Mr Martin, the former finance minister, was hardly a champion of greenhouse gas reductions in his years in cabinet. When he took over from the former prime minister, Jean Chretien, as Liberal leader in late 2003, he was already constructing an exit policy for himself on Kyoto. \"What I have said very clearly is you need a plan to determine whether in fact you can meet those targets,\" Mr Martin said when he was asked repeatedly about the accord. He started sounding a little greener last year during the closely-fought federal election campaign. Desperate to attract voters from the left, the prime minister promised that Canada would honour its Kyoto commitments. That won't be easy. Back in 1997 in an all-night negotiating session in Kyoto, Canada agreed to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 6% below 1990 levels by 2012. At the time, the Liberal government had little notion how Canada would ever achieve that goal - a state of optimistic ignorance that persisted for years. Canada's energy consumption has steadily increased since 1997. By some estimates, Canada will have to reduce its use of fossil fuels by 30% to meet the Kyoto target. \"Despite good words and good intentions, the federal government has not yet delivered real reductions,\" Elizabeth May, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada, said in a recent report. \"Unless the 2005 budget and next Parliamentary session deliver real progress,\" she added, \"Canada's reputation and performance will be an international embarrassment.\" How to do it? Mr Martin, who heads a minority government, doesn't want to renege on a major promise, and he and his officials are now scrambling to cobble together a credible plan. Over the years, the federal government has wasted millions on brochures and public education campaigns that gently prodded Canadians to reduce their use of energy. Proposals for more significant action died amid squabbling between government departments with duelling agendas. The new measures should be revealed sometime this month, probably in the federal budget. They are expected to include subsidies and tax incentives to get ordinary Canadians to buy hybrid cars or solar energy systems, and to get business and industry to reduce emissions. Canada, however, will have difficulty living up to Kyoto without resorting to spending millions on credits from countries that have exceeded their targets. This is legitimate under the accord, but writing cheques to star Kyoto performers will be a tough sell to Canadian taxpayers. Canadians may not be as immediately threatened by global warming as some nations, especially the small island states that could disappear under rising sea levels. But the changes that scientists have predicted will come with global warming may already be happening here, especially in the north. Polar bears are having trouble finding food because thin ice is forcing them back to land before they can fatten up on seals. Some Inuit have expressed fears that their villages will have to be relocated. But polls show that many don't understand how their own consumer habits - like driving gas guzzling SUVs - are related to increased emissions that are trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere. Canada is not the only country having trouble living up to Kyoto. Japan is also behind. As Mr Martin noted on a recent trip to that country, the protocol has a provision that allows countries that don't meet the 2012 deadline to carry over those obligations to subsequent stages of the agreement. Perhaps the Liberals will argue that is the same thing as \"honouring\" Kyoto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2004/sep/15/energy.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2004-09-15T16:11:57Z","webTitle":"Has Blair the energy to convince Exxon?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/sep/15/energy.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2004/sep/15/energy.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Has Blair the energy to convince Exxon?","bodyText":"If Tony Blair really believes that the world needs a \"new green industrial revolution\" to head the \"catastrophic consequences of climate change\", he will have to convince some powerful players. One way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions is to shift from fossil fuels - oil, gas and coal - to cleaner energy such as wind and solar, and to promote energy efficiency. But try telling that to ExxonMobil, regarded as a dinosaur of the carbon age by environmentalists. In the oil business, ExxonMobil stands out from its peers. The hugely profitable oil giant - it earned of $12.5bn (£11.9bn) last year - sticks resolutely to its core business of oil and gas. Unlike its rivals BP and Shell, Exxon does not invest in solar energy and takes a sceptical of view of renewable power. In its energy projections to 2020, Exxon said that it believes the combined contribution of wind and solar to total energy supplies will be less than 0.5%. As Exxon said in its February report on Energy Trends: \"Though each of the renewable power-generation options has a place, the limitations of current technologies preclude any of them being suitable for meeting a large enough share of long-term energy supply needs to displace conventional energy sources.\" On top of that, Exxon sees an inexorable rise in demand for energy, especially in the developing world as countries like China and India make their dash for growth. Even in the developed world, energy consumption is set to rise despite an increase in more energy efficient cars and appliances. \"Fridges may have become more energy efficient but power consumption does not necessarily decrease, because people want bigger American-style fridges, or keep the older more inefficient fridge for beer. As for cars, people now want to buy SUVs, which consume more petrol,\" an ExxonMobil economist said. Exxon, which is dubious about the effectiveness of Kyoto, does admit that the potential impact of carbon dioxide emissions may prove to be significant. Exxon has curbed its own emissions and is funding research into trapping carbon dioxide and storing it underground or on the ocean floor - a technique called carbon sequestration. Shell also sees promise in this avenue, but critics argue that the idea is expensive and probably unworkable. In all though, Exxon remains firmly committed to carbon. You will not find any mention of \"tipping point\" in Exxon documents or pronouncements, the term used by some observers to describe the stage where the world leaves behind the carbon age for the brave new world of clean hydrogen. As far as Exxon is concerned, the world will still depend heavily on carbon for the next 20 or more years. Exxon has a point. Mr Blair talks a good game on climate change, but it has been mostly that - talk. Mr Blair himself admitted yesterday that Britain might not meet its stated goal of cutting emissions by 20%. As for renewables, most energy experts believe the government has as much chance of hitting its target of producing 10% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010 as the US of banning SUVs. Professor Ian Fells, the chairman of the New and Renewable Energy Centre, believes Britain will be lucky to reach 6% by 2010. At the moment the figure is just 2.8%. An example of where the government is falling down is solar energy. The solar industry has invested millions of pounds on the strength of government commitments, stated in last year's energy white paper (pdf) to a 10-year demonstration programme of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels - which convert light to electricity. But industry officials fear that from next March, the government will replace the scheme, which provides capital grants for installing PV systems, with an unspecified amount of funding from a \"technology-blind\" programme - not favouring any particular form of renewable power - of support for building integrated renewables and energy efficient technologies. No wonder ExxonMobil is sticking to oil. Unless self-proclaimed environmentally-friendly governments show more commitment to renewable energy and to weaning consumers off SUVs, the tipping-point will be a long way off. · Mark Tran is business editor of Guardian Unlimited."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2004/aug/25/environment.environment2","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2004-08-25T00:24:42Z","webTitle":"Village damned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/aug/25/environment.environment2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2004/aug/25/environment.environment2","fields":{"headline":"Village damned","bodyText":"Greece has missed the chance to green the Olympics and to build on what Sydney achieved in 2000, says a Greenpeace environmental audit of the games.

They went on: \"Athens 2004 would like to be the first Olympiad using 100% green energy\". But renewable energy accounts for virtually none of the energy produced and distributed at the games, says Greenpeace. Solar energy photovoltaic cells have not been used in the Olympic village or other venues, and solar thermal systems, for hot water supply and cooling systems, have also been ignored. All this in a country with one of the most advanced solar manufacturing industries in the world. According to the report, the large Olympic village housing competitors ignored almost every environmental recommendation made. Plans for conservation and recycling of water were dropped, no wood from sustainable sources was used and oversized air-conditioning systems were installed. Nikos Charalambides of Greenpeace Greece says: \"Instead of moving forward, the Athens 2004 games has gone way back as far as environmental issues are concerned.

Ron Oxburgh, the chairman of the oil giant said: \"No one could be comfortable at the prospect of continuing to pump the amounts of carbon dioxide that we are pumping out at the present.\" Lord Oxburgh's comments are music to the ears of Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of Solar Century, a company committed to harnessing the power of the sun to produce clean energy. In an unremarkable building, tucked into a side street behind London Waterloo's station, Solar Century stands at the forefront of a small but significant revolution. On its roof are the tools of the revolution, solar panels of photo-voltaic (PV) tiles that generate electricity directly from light, supplying clean power. Leggett, scientist turned environmental activist turned entrepreneur, is particularly proud of the company's new solar roof tile, the C21. Unlike earlier solar panels, the C21 looks virtually indistinguishable from normal grey roof tiles. Developed specifically for the UK housing market, the C21 won the best exterior product award at this year's Interbuild trade show for the construction industry in April. To win recognition in the highly conservative £80bn building sector is a breakthrough for this upstart of less than four years. Solar Century also won a prize for best electrical and lighting product with an illuminated bus shelter powered by solar energy. Solar tiles, solar bus shelters and solar bus stations - it is an odd destination for a former oilman. Leggett, who turned 50 in March, was once a lecturer in earth sciences at the Royal School of Mines at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in Kensington, an elite training house for oil and mining executives. In the 1980s, he helped turn out petroleum geologists and petroleum executives in their hundreds, supplementing his income by consulting for the oil companies that were recruiting his students. He enjoyed working in an environment where he rubbed shoulders with oil industry megastars. The romance started to wear off in the mid-1980s when he read warnings in the scientific journals about burning too much fossil fuels - oil, coal and gas - and the risks posed to the earth's climate. He resigned in 1989 to join Greenpeace as the environmental group's chief scientist. \"I was very naive, I thought other people would walk out of the oil companies,\" Leggett says. \"But there were a lot of uncertainties and no unanimity about climate change then, whereas now we can definitely see the footprints, the horror is around the corner.\" As a Greenpeace activist, Leggett attended numerous international meetings on climate change, trading blows intellectually with the lobbyists from the oil giants and the representatives from the Gulf oil states, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. He stayed at Greenpeace until 1996, when he left to become visiting fellow at the Centre for Environmental Policy and Understanding. Of his departure from Greenpeace, Leggett says: \"It was not a divorce, but you can't grow old peacefully in an organisation like that. I always intended to get out, I always had an exit strategy.\" He is still battling the oil companies, but this time commercially. Initially founded by Leggett in 1997, Solar Century became a commercial company in 2000, after Leggett raised £7m just before the technology bubble burst. Leggett runs a company of 40 people who come from the oil and power industries, environmental groups, the armed forces, government, development and aid charities, the IT industry, and investment banking. Solar Century's customers include J Sainsbury, Channel 4 and Laing Homes. The solar power business in the UK is small - in fact renewables make up only 2.8% of the UK's total energy needs. In its last financial year, Solar Century had sales of £4.2m, up from £2.8m the year before. Yet it describes itself as one of Britain's leading solar energy companies. In the UK, its main competitor is BP Solar, the world's second largest solar power firm. \"We compete OK with them. We beat them on a regular basis and win projects because of our brand, we don't have the taint of carbon,\" Leggett says. Leggett has ambivalent feelings towards BP Solar. He faults the oil companies for not putting as much zeal into renewable energy as they did with oil, yet acknowledges that the existence BP Solar gives renewable energy a cachet of legitimacy with investors. Leggett thinks the era of renewable energy is inevitable and sees his job as \"constantly searching for ways to accelerate the inevitable\". But the inevitable is arriving at snail's pace in the UK, Leggett admits. Moreover, the current subsidy system, where the government gives a 50% grant towards the cost of solar panels is about to run out, and no decision has been made on what will replace it. EU figures show how far the UK lacks behind the rest of Europe. According to the EU, the UK's photo-voltaic capacity at the end of 2002 amounted to only 4.25MW (million watts), putting Britain 10th in the 15-member EU, before enlargement this year. Top by far was Germany, which currently drives growth in the EU market. Led by its \"100 000 solar roofs\" programme, Germany installed 82 MW in 2002, putting its capacity at 278 MW. In second place is the Netherlands, though its output is dramatically lower than Germany, followed closely by Italy, Spain and France to create the EU top five. Leggett is critical of both government and the oil companies for dragging their feet on renewable energy. He castigates the government for falling \"embarrassingly short\" of its rhetoric on renewables and believes the oil companies are paying only lip service to green energy, because they are reluctant to cannibalise their revenues from oil. He singles out Exxon, which is sceptical about the science behind global warming, for leading the rest of the oil industry astray in the 1990s, when they were prepared to back renewables. \"The industry came off the rails when Exxon succeeded in turning itself into the world's most profitable company. It was rewarded in the stock market, which sent out the signal that every penny spent on renewable energy was a penny wasted,\" Leggett argues. Nevertheless, Leggett believes passionately that the \"tipping point\" for clean energy is close. He is not alone in this. Vijay Vaitheeswaran, the energy and environment correspondent for the Economist, argues in his book, Power to the People, that we are on the cusp of an energy revolution as the world moves from oil to cleaner fuels. \"We are in the first stages of seeing new flows of venture capital into area such as solar energy,\" Vaitheeswaran said at a recent seminar on the geopolitics of oil, organised by the Economist magazine. As Solar Century waits for the revolution, which it believes is less than a decade away, it is targeting niches. Leggett acknowledges that cost is a barrier at the moment, with solar panels working out at around £5,000, with a government grant. But he is confident that the construction industry will realise that solar panels will add value to properties and will be in demand. \"Someone one day will build 10 houses with solar PV panels in a development and will see that they will sell first,\" he argues. John Mogford, the managing director of BP Solar, puts the problem in a nutshell. He says solar energy is too expensive and that prices need to come down by 50% to match carbon. Mogford, who praises Leggett for his activism and energy, argues that BP Solar cannot grow faster than the UK market. \"We can't make huge investments in manufacturing until the demand for products is there, but we are growing as fast as prudently possible,\" says Mogford, adding that wind power is more promising for the UK than solar because of weather conditions and of low electricity prices which act as a disincentive to switch to more expensive solar energy. In any case, as long as governments and the public are addicted to cheap energy and as long as Saudi Arabia and the rest of the oil producing countries can keep oil inexpensive, the energy revolution may take some time coming. \"It is very frustrating when you have your hands on the technology and there is only desultory support from government and disingenuous representations from oil companies,\" Leggett says. \"But we are near the tipping point. We are not there yet but I'm optimistic.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2005/apr/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview25","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2005-04-22T23:35:19Z","webTitle":"Non-fiction: Apr 23","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview25","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2005/apr/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview25","fields":{"headline":"Green shoots","bodyText":"Save Cash and Save the Planet, by Andrea Smith and Nicola Baird (Collins, £12.99) Friends of the Earth attempts to appeal to the British bargain mentality and in the process move beyond the middle-class constituency that is currently the environmentalist's natural habitat. Part of the problem of a how-to book aimed at a broad audience is that sometimes it will inevitably be a frustrating and patronising read - there are only so many times you can read about putting less water in your kettle. But just as I was saying to myself \"tell me something I don't know\", they did. From underfloor heating and solar energy, through greener funerals and cleaning with lemon juice, there are some great ideas here that apparently can save you around £80,000 over a lifetime and are aimed at helping the chemical generation avoid toxic living. In the process, it does manage to make reducing consumption seem positive and interesting rather than an act of purse-lipped puritan denial. JL The End of Oil: The Decline of the Petroleum Economy and the Rise of a New Energy Order, by Paul Roberts (Bloomsbury, £8.99) In the year since this book appeared in hardback, oil prices have risen from $30 to $50 a barrel. Paul Roberts could rightly say, \"I told you so\". He argues convincingly that the world is on the brink of a revolution: \"The current energy economy is on its way out.\" Roberts tells the history of our energy-dependency and predicts the shape of the new energy order, from hybrid power systems to hydrogen fuel cells. He has harsh words for his fellow Americans, \"the most profligate users of energy in the history of the world\". With less than 5% of the world's population, America burns 25% of the planet's energy. For Roberts, the answer is not \"to wait for the technology of tomorrow\" but to conserve what we have: \"Efficiency remains our greatest hope.\" From global warming to the \"continuing fiasco of Iraq\", he shows why the future of oil matters. So buy those energy-saving bulbs now. PDS The Western, by Philip French (Carcanet, £14.95) Updated from its 1973 edition - or rather, supplied with a substantial sequel that tracks the genre forward from Robert Altman's cold, wet, grubby McCabe and Mrs Miller as far as HBO's very new television series, Deadwood (a dirtier riff on the Altman). French is prepared to revise his opinions when the evidence changes - he thinks the DVD of the uncut Dances With Wolves far better than the featherbrained yet pious version that showed in cinemas, and his case that the abuse the critics poured on Heaven's Gate was unjustified is almost persuasive. He's still a true believer, too, rightly choosing to praise films that others rode by heedless, such as Ang Lee's civil war horse opera, Ride with the Devil and Walter Hill's gloomy Wild Bill; and he understands that the faces of the great character actors - for example, eternal sidekick Richard Farnsworth - contributed more to the landscape of the screen west than ever did mesas and buttes. VR A Humument: A Treated Victorian Novel, by Tom Phillips (Thames &amp; Hudson, £16.95) Phillips's kaleidoscopically inventive work is an ongoing, four-decades-in-the-making art book. In 1962 he bought a Victorian novel for threepence, the little-known WH Mallock's A Human Document, and experimented with painting an image over every page and picking out particular words. This is the fourth edition of a remarkable and inspired work which has attracted a sizeable cult following and preoccupied literary theorists such as N Katherine Hayles. Plundering various canons of art and slicing together different modes of imagery, A Humument also foregrounds Victorian and contemporary obsessions with sex. While lacking narrative drive or progressive gender politics, its staggering visual and textual inventiveness means that it has some claim to be the Ulysses of art books it at times appears to want to be. Perhaps the next edition should leave a couple of blank pages for the readers to join in, too. JL Leonardo da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind, by Charles Nicholl (Penguin, £9.99) Charles Nicholl's superb biography of the Renaissance genius focuses on \"Leonardo the man\". As well as the paintings, he looks in detail at the 7,000 extant pages of manuscript, including the notebooks which this \"multi-talented dreamer\" kept attached to his belt. From ribald jokes, designs for flying machines, breathtaking anatomical sketches, to how they carried grapes in Cesena, these notebooks give an extraordinary insight into the person Kenneth Clark called \"the most relentlessly curious man in history\". Leonardo described himself as a \"disciple of experience\" and no subject was too small for him: there's even an investigation into \"Why dogs willingly sniff one another's bottoms\". But as so often in biographies, it is the details that are most revealing: people's faces could suddenly enthral him and he would follow someone around all day long, just for a chance of adding their deftly drawn features into his notebook. PDS A Little History of British Gardening, by Jenny Uglow (Pimlico, £10) This won't replace Jane Brown's Pursuit of Pleasure as my fave horticultural narrative, but it came close; partly because of its generous layout and illustrations and partly because of Uglow's amiable tone. She cares for all that can be persuaded to grow - the gooseberries of Lancashire, raised for show from the 1740s on, or the poppies of the Dungeness shingle, sown by Derek Jarman to defy waste and death. (Uglow proposes to adopt a vegetable from a list of endangered old varieties - the climbing French bean called lazy housewife). She covers major estate fashions - park, wilderness, landscape, hothouses - with amusement, but her heart is really with those who shove in the spade themselves: with the Sikh community planting Khalsa Wood outside Nottingham, and with the Pooters, failing to raise a single half-hardy annual in their back garden running down to the railway at The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway.

The moment you arrive in the Fo household, you realise you are going to have the greatest difficulty in keeping any sort of a grip on the situation. It is as if you had strayed on stage during one of Dario Fo's frenetic comedies and been taken for a member of the cast. Phones ring. Crises erupt. People burst in demanding instant responses to urgent questions. An entire set has to be moved to Naples that morning and the transport firm wants €8,000 (£5,400). \"Eight thousand euros, Dario! What should we tell them?\" More phones ring. Fo begins to make a point (was it the one about the carvings in Modena cathedral looking like centaurs but really being teachers? Whatever). His wife, Franca Rame, cuts him short. She starts on an opinion of her own. He interrupts her. I try to slip in a question. Another phone rings. Rame lifts the receiver and lets it fall back on the hook; looks fleetingly guilty; gives a \"What is one to do?\" shrug. At any moment you expect a coup de théâtre of the sort for which Fo is celebrated. Were kidnappers disguised as firemen to burst in, as in Abducting Diana, seize his personal assistant and drag her from the flat, it would not seem inappropriate. In fact, the coup de théâtre has already taken place. And this is the result. Dario Fo - at 79 still the most subversive man in Italy - wants to be mayor of Milan. The idea of an elderly anarcho-Marxist trying to take over the running of the country's business capital might provide him with a splendid plot for a play. But this is for real. The latest poll, in last week's edition of the news magazine L'Espresso, suggested the right's reputedly reluctant candidate, Silvio Berlusconi's education minister, Letizia Moratti, was doomed from the outset: she stood to win less than 30% of the vote. So it looks as if it will all come down to a \"primary election\" in January to decide who should run against her. \"It's the primary that counts,\" says Fo. \"Whoever wins the primary is already the mayor.\" Victory would make him the official candidate of \"the - the - what's it called? - the, erm ...\" Fo flaps his hand and snaps his fingers. \"Union?\" puts in a helpful documentary maker who is here to follow his campaign. \"Yes. Union.\" The Union is Italy's opposition alliance. Its principal components, including most of what is left of the old Italian Communist party, are backing a suit- and tie-wearing former prefect of Milan, Bruno Ferrante. But the Espresso poll showed that he faced a stiff challenge from Fo. The 1997 Nobel prize winner for literature was found to be better known to voters, and almost as trusted as the former prefect. Asked who they intended to vote for, 46% opted for Ferrante and 34% for Fo. But large numbers were still undecided. The playwright and actor has the support of half the Greens and the all-important backing of a party whose supporters - pacifists, minority advocates, radical leftists and old-style trade-unionists - floated its candidate to victory in an earlier primary in another part of Italy. This party is \"er - er - Communist Reconstruction\", says Fo. \"Communist Re-found-ation,\" says his PA with the tone of one who has said the same thing many times before. It is not that this brilliant man is becoming forgetful. No one can doubt his formidable mental and physical stamina. Two nights before our interview he had performed a two-hour monologue at a theatre outside Milan. It is just that parties and alliances do not have much of a place in his pristine vision of politics as a contest between il popolo (the people) and i potenti (the powerful). When he was given an honorary doctorate by the Sorbonne earlier this year, he told a story that was quintessential Fo: half arcane erudition, half sheer whimsy. He explained that, in the 17th century, there had been a fashion - much favoured by the rich and powerful - for wearing extraordinarily heavy cloaks. The only snag was that high winds could actually carry away the wearer, who would sometimes never reappear. \"It is a fashion,\" he concluded, \"that I feel ought to be revived.\" But, hold on, is not Fo himself now trying to become one of i potenti? He laughs and shakes his head. \"I would say that I fly even without a cloak,\" he says. \"My calling has been enabling me to fly for a long time. It's just that my flying is metaphysical and not real, so I don't end up being dashed against buildings.\" Which, if you think about it, is a pretty good politician's evasive answer. So I press. \"I saw what was happening in Milan,\" he says. \"I saw an enormous confusion on the left. They were constantly proposing candidates; one was a great surgeon, an expert on cancer, another a great journalist, a former editor of Corriere della Sera. And then there were rows. This one didn't suit that one, and so on. I said to myself: 'What is it that the left is looking for? It's looking for moderates.' The left of the right - I mean the Catholics - they want at all costs to have a moderate.\" And \"moderate\", in the Fo vocabulary, is not a good thing. The left in his beloved Milan were slipping off down the same road as the Italian left, which is fielding a moderate Catholic and ardent privatiser, Romano Prodi, against Silvio Berlusconi in next year's general election. But then the Italian left was itself following a path already trodden by New Labour and Tony Blair. \"Blair? He brings me up in goosebumps,\" says Fo. \"He has nothing to do with the left, either culturally or behaviourally. He even manages to be friends with Berlusconi.\" Then he mumbles something I don't catch. It is only later, when I play back the Minidisc, that I hear he had added: \"He must have a strong stomach.\" I put it to him that a lot of people are saying the left, as the left, is finished. \"It hasn't died,\" he insists. \"But it needs to renew itself and to create revolutions - not bloody revolutions, but revolutions in the sense of changing people's way of thinking, of living.\" For example? \"Well, stopping traffic from entering the centre of the city,\" says Fo. He already has a plan for swap points on the outskirts of Milan where people will be able to park their cars and get on non-polluting public transport. So, more green than red? He laughs. But he doesn't disagree. Nor does he disagree when I say we seem to be watching the emergence of a postmodern Fo. \"Call him what you will,\" he says pleasantly. His campaign is designed to fall into two uneven halves. The first is mainly concerned with research. To a greater extent than most playwrights, Fo has always been intrigued by hard fact, and it turns out that he has a bit of the journalist about him. He says he has an instinctive preference for gathering information from people rather than books. He explains how he went about writing perhaps his most celebrated play, Accidental Death of an Anarchist. \"First of all, I went to see the lawyers for the other side. They gave me the outlines. I studied the case. But I didn't stop there. There were the anarchist groups and I interviewed them. Then I read all of what the newspapers had written about the case. I became a familiar figure in the courts, listening to what was happening. And at the same time I began to write, to put it all down. \"This time, I'm not trying to put together a script, but a clear argument which above all convinces people who normally don't know the details and don't listen to them because they're so often communicated in a boring way, without any warmth, or passion or indignation.\" Indignazione, along with popolo and potenti, is a Fo keyword. It crops up again and again, as in: \"I want people, when they listen to me, to decide whether to vote for me, to be as indignant as I am.\" Right now, Fo is indignant over Milan, \"a city with a great cultural tradition\". \"After the war, it was perhaps the most advanced in terms of its theatre, cinema, literature, journalism, its engineers, architects and painters. Now it has crumbled,\" he says. Milan has become an \"old city with no drive, no enthusiasm for renewal\". Everywhere he looks he sees \"a standardised, fossilised mentality\". So \"for the past 15 days, every day, I've been meeting people - technicians, experts - but from outside the mainstream. They're not conventional.\" On the board behind him is a note pinned up to remind him of an appointment with the internationally renowned architect Massimiliano Fuksas. When I arrived he had been bidding farewell to an expert on waste management. His desk is still covered with big sheets of paper on which he has been taking notes and drawing sketches to do with garbage collection. It is hard to imagine anything similar on Harold Pinter's desk. As he pours out his findings, it is clear that Fo's limitless enthusiasm has penetrated to other, equally unexpected corners. Do I realise, he asks, that Germany is generating 300 megawatts of solar energy? And am I aware that there are no fewer than three water-bearing layers of rock beneath Milan? Two are polluted. But \"then there is an even deeper layer which is very old, from the Ice Age in fact, 200 metres down\". And the present council is planning to sell it off. \"Terrible.\" Now that he has assembled his facts and figures, he is preparing for the second - and perhaps more difficult - phase of his campaign, which is to present it all to the electorate in a way that can persuade them to part with their votes. Fo has a serious handicap: he can pretty much forget about access to television. He is far too hot to handle for the state-owned Rai, which banished his last series of programmes, on cultural themes, to a slot just before midnight. One of Italy's four commercial channels belongs to a businessman who is said to be backing his rival, Ferrante. Silvio Berlusconi owns the other three and will scarcely want to give airtime to a man who has pilloried him mercilessly. Fo's last play, L'Anomalo Bicefalo, includes the scene (which he later shows me over lunch) in which the prime minister is reduced to the height of a dwarf. So Fo is planning to campaign from the stage. On Monday night, Fo began applying his peculiar skills to political campaigning with a show at Milan's biggest theatre, capacity 3,500. \"We're going to put on a series of shows, in fact. One every Monday. They won't be conferences and they won't be rallies, but lectures. It will be theatre as a representation of reality.\" But are today's Italians ready to listen? Mistero Buffo, the most celebrated of all Fo's subversive monologues, was first put on in 1969 - a year after Europe's universities erupted, transforming the continent's political landscape, if not for ever, then certainly for a generation. Revolution was in the air, mingled with tear gas, and nowhere more so than in Italy. But that earnest Italy and today's Italy of Silvio Berlusconi and Isola dei Famosi (Celebrity Island) are very different places. I start to ask Fo whether, back in the 70s, he had ever imagined that his country - \"Would have come to this?\" he cuts in. \"No, no, no. Would I have ever thought that all these superficial things would have become so important? No. I would never have believed it.\" For just a second, the irrepressible ebullience of the master storyteller evaporates. Then he perks up again. \"If you dig deeper,\" he says, \"beneath that layer of obtuseness that seems to cover the nation, you find people of a different calibre.\" He is off again, enthusing about the few campaigning excursions he has already made and how everywhere he goes he has found himself surrounded by \"a crowd of people who want me to tell them the other story\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2006/apr/29/news.weekendmagazine","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2006-04-29T00:06:14Z","webTitle":"Andrew Smith explores the inventions that never got off the ground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/apr/29/news.weekendmagazine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2006/apr/29/news.weekendmagazine","fields":{"headline":"The ghosts of futures past","bodyText":"After the lunar grey of London on an overcast spring day, the clean red-brick interior of the British Library seems improbably bright and welcoming. The reading rooms are full, but just as many people choose to linger in the foyer or chatter in the cafes, as if the knowledge held in the vaults downstairs radiates upwards, where they can absorb it without turning a page. I love this place. Only on planes and trains do I accomplish less and feel less guilty about it. Today, though, there's strange work to be done. A fortnight ago, another grey day such as this was brightened by the revelation that back in 1973, the teetering year of Watergate and The Exorcist, of power cuts and platform boots, the British Railways Board was granted a patent for a flying saucer. A student had stumbled across the long-forgotten plans while trawling the patent archives, and the media's reports had raised not just a smile but a pang of nostalgia for the good old days of the state rail monopoly. You won't find Connex dreaming of spaceships. Viewed in isolation and from this distance, BR's plan looks hilarious. The board asked an inventor named Charles Osmond Frederick to come up with a \"lifting platform\", only for him to return with a design for a clean, super-fast, space-ready saucer. According to the original patent document (GB1310990), the vehicle was to be powered by laser-controlled thermonuclear fusion, a technique Frederick might reasonably have assumed to be imminent but which, like so many expectations from that era, failed to materialise. So eventually the patent lapsed and the saucer was consigned to its archive graveyard, waiting to tickle future generations with the idea that a body incapable of reaching Eastbourne reliably might contemplate reaching for the stars. Look a little closer, though, and the BR saucer emerges as something far more intriguing and substantial: the ghost of a future that didn't happen. Writing in this paper a few weeks ago, Ian McEwan noted the way science \"prefers to forget much of its past - it is constitutionally bound to a form of selective amnesia\". Redundant theories and failed designs, being simply wrong, have no further utility and are quickly buried, he suggests. And one of the places they're buried is here. Patent applications are assessed in Newport, but the records and database fall under the aegis of the British Library's business and intellectual property centre. Their enthusiastic keeper, Stephen van Dulken, has written several books on the subject and points out that anyone with access to the internet can tour this weird outpost of the imagination at any time (patent.gov.uk), and that European and US records are available, too. The difficulty is knowing how to negotiate such a vast terrain: van Dulken warns that there are 50m patents to lose yourself in, with another 1m added annually. To say I'm glad of his help is an understatement. Most of the writing on patents and inventions focuses on the relative handful of world-changing ones and, to be sure, stumbling across the big names is a thrill. Here's Barnes Wallis's Dam Buster Bomb (GB937959); Leo Fender's electric guitar (US2455575) in 1948; Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome (US2682235); the Wright brothers' 1906 aeroplane (US821393); Thomas Edison's phonograph from 1877 (GB2909/1877), all with the original diagrams, descriptions and addresses. In contrast, there is almost nothing on those bright ideas that failed, and in the weeks following my tutorial with van Dulken, I sink deeper and deeper into both the literature and the labyrinthine database, watching rapt as pictures begin to emerge from the morass. The first shock comes almost immediately: there are loads of patents for flying saucers. Some are essentially futuristic aircraft, with recognisable cockpits, such as Homer F Streib's design from 1959 (US2876965). Others are classic saucers (US3394906, 1968, and US3442469, 1969) or UFO-styled confections such as the Brazilian Olympio F Pinto's swollen disc (US3774865) from 1972. The crazily prolific British inventor Arthur Paul Pedrick, who, after service at the Patent Office, spent his retirement filling his former colleagues' files with ideas for everything from tea strainers to supersonic transport planes and orbiting nuclear bombs, also had a go, in 1973. His lovingly rendered ship, GB1331655, is shaped like a flying teardrop. Charles Osmond Frederick is nonplussed by the fuss surrounding his speculative design for British Rail. He is now 69 and retired, but in the late 1960s he was a nuclear-trained engineer working for BR's railway research department in Derby. He explains that although the patent for his \"space vehicle\" was granted in 1973, it was filed in 1970, in the wake of the first manned moon landings and the maiden flight of Concorde. He was part of a generation for whom anything seemed possible: when the youthful Arthur C Clarke floated the notion of communications satellites in 1945, he didn't bother taking out any patents because he couldn't believe such a thing would be possible in his lifetime. Yet within 25 years there were not only \"comsats\", but people on the moon. As Clarke watched Apollo 11 begin its journey to the lunar surface in 1969, he declared, \"Today the new world begins\" and meant it. By 1970, space elevators and fusion-powered saucers were the stuff of mature adult conversation. Frederick's long silences and cautious speech attest to how much times have changed. The story of his saucer resurfaces every few years, and he knows the context to his beautiful folly will be lost. The rest of us won't see the Blade Runner-style flying cars, self-cleaning houses, hovering platforms, wingless supersonic aircraft and orgone energy accumulators that surround his saucer in the patents archive - all the things people saw in sci-fi films and TV programmes such as Space 1999, which they expected to encounter in real life one day, but never did. His saucer had a hinterland of hopes and dreams of better lives, better worlds, that is no longer visible to us. Yet it's what I'm looking at now. These lost patents, taken together, comprise a kind of secret social history. Even the many absurdities tell coherent tales if you spend enough time with them. An \"airplane hijacking injector\" (US3841328), for instance, involves stationing hypodermic needles under every aircraft seat, ready to \"sedate or kill the passenger\" at the flick of a pilot's switch. In the ecstasy of creation, it never occurred to inventor Jack Jensen, of Fort Worth, Texas, that the rest of us might be reluctant to sit on seats equipped with death needles. All the same, hijacking was a big issue when the patent was filed in 1972 and proposed solutions are scattered through the records, clustering in the early 1970s and after 9/11, just as private fallout shelters and esoteric aids to domestic life litter the 1950s (try \"sanitary appliance for birds\", GB2882858), and increasingly desperate barriers to HIV mark the late 1980s. The most revealing area of all is sex. The Victorian era groans with methods for preventing \"nocturnal emissions\" and \"self-abuse\", and for encouraging chastity in the manner of Mrs Ellen E Perkins's \"sexual armor\" (US875845), patented in 1908. Against that, the 1930s see the emergence of such enlightened ideas as \"a device for promoting marital accord\" (US2024983), while the 1970s, that time of militant feminism and free-love backlash, provide many variations on the theme of \"penis locking and lacerating vaginal insert\" (US4016875), or the \"family sex education board game\", formulated by two New York couples in 1979 (US4273337). Among the most melancholy of the late-1980s anti-HIV patents are myriad versions of the \"no-hands contraceptive device\" and the \"unisex condom incorporated into underpants\" (US4972850 and 4966165), both of which free users from the necessity of touching each other during intercourse, as the \"protective mask\" (patented by one Cynthia Hussey) does in relation to oral sex. And there are forests of novel condoms, ranging from the Femidom to a \"force-sensitive, sound-playing\" job capable of heightening the crucial moment with God Save The Queen or something by James Blunt. I'm not sure what to make of the brothers who patented the Bobby Charlton \"comb-over\" hairstyle in 1977 (as US4022227). But even in the realm of completely bonkers patents, of which there are many, appearances can be deceptive. The most notorious among experts such as van Dulken is an \"apparatus for facilitating the birth of a child by centrifugal force\", which was devised by Mr and Mrs Blonsky in 1965 (US3216423). Their plans detail what is in essence a fast-spinning bed, leading you to wonder who in their right mind...? But they point out in their application that, with the newly sedentary lifestyle of the space age, many women would no longer have reason to exercise the muscles evolved for childbirth, making the enterprise more difficult and leading to an inexorable rise in caesarean deliveries. Centrifugal force was their answer to a future in which we would have less and less direct physical connection to the world around us. Who are these unwitting chroniclers? Our most high-profile inventor, James Dyson, chuckles darkly as he explains that the mad inventor is an officially recognised construct. \"You don't get a patent unless you happened across it unintentionally,\" he says. \"It's an invention: you come across it, you don't deduce it from discernible facts. If it could have been done by one 'skilled in the arts', you don't get a patent. That's why there are so many apocryphal stories about how inventors happened across their inventions while looking for something else - because you have to make them up.\" So the idea of epiphany, of the shamanic techno-seer being touched by some unseen force, is written into the process. Dyson points out that established patents in the same field as a new application are referred to as \"prior art\", and discusses US patent commissioner Charles H Duell's controversial declaration in 1899 that \"everything which can be invented has been invented\". Dyson adds that he thinks this was true by then - all we do now is improve and embellish. This sounds preposterous at first, but a search of the records and a call to Paul Collins, author of a superb book on forgotten Victorian innovators called Banvard's Folly, suggests the Victorian era does indeed account for almost everything, from the fax machine (1843, GB9745) to the computer (1884, US395781-783), to Frank Shuman's visionary plan, back in 1908, to replace coal with solar energy for the whole of Europe (GB190728130). All the same, Dyson notes that some good ideas never do catch on, among them Joyce Marie Slaton's improbably chic and futuristic-looking umbrella hat (GB1176737, 1970). A brilliant idea, he insists, but people thought they might look silly in it. Until recently, Mark Sheahan, creator of a promising new form of plastic container called the Squeezeopen, introduced himself as a designer rather than an inventor, \"because people automatically pegged you as a madman in a garden shed if you told the truth\". He provides an insight into the wilder reaches of invention when he admits that \"being an inventor can make you quite insular and paranoid if you're not careful, and also stir crazy. Generally we're square pegs in a round hole. Different. But to do what we do, you've got to be an optimist, too.\" At the age of 91, Frances Gabe, née Bateson, of Newberg, Oregon, qualifies as both different and optimistic. She took 18 years to design and build the self-cleaning house in which she still lives. The design incorporates spray jets that hang from the ceiling, with floors gently sloped to drain away the water. Valuables are kept under glass and furniture treated to survive the wash, after which warm air rises from the floor. Even handbasins, sinks and storage areas are self-cleaning, with clothes washed while hanging in the cupboard. The place is now a mecca for inventors, but asked whether neighbours thought she was crazy when she set out, Gabe guffaws: \"Oh yeah, sure. Any time you try to do something different, people think you're nutty. Now everybody listens to what I say, but they didn't before.\" From an early age, Gabe preferred visiting building sites with her architect/contractor father to staying at home. Her mother and sister were \"pretty ornery\" about this, but the builders loved her and taught her the skills she has spent the rest of her life applying. Later, other male builders would turn up at her house insisting, \"You can't do that - it won't work!\" but she always made it work. And it wasn't just men who gave her a hard time, as becomes clear when I ask what drew her to such a huge project. \"I just felt so terrible watching people cleaning dirt out of their houses all the time,\" she says. \"So primitive, making 'em dirty, then cleaning 'em out, when there are so many better things to do. And you know, one time I had a group of furious housewives on my doorstep, telling me I was doing them out of a job and that if they didn't have to clean their houses, their husbands wouldn't need them any more. And I said, 'Well, if you had more time to spend with your husbands, don't you think they would like that better? Or with your children? Or how about on your own education?' \" No one, she admits sadly, has tried to replicate her house. \"You know, they never did. I'm generous with the patent, too - I want to pass the knowledge on.\" It's easy to forget that for the inventor, the unrealised futures we're talking about also define their own. The future exists only in the imagination, but our expectations of it bear on the present, making it both virtual and real at the same time. When President Nixon approved plans for the space shuttle, some believe he did so because Stanley Kubrick had already shown him one in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which made it seem familiar, logical, safe. Maybe the most significant difference between then and now is that, for better or worse, liking the idea of something was once seen as a good enough reason for doing it. Commercial imperatives came into play, too. Richard Boyd of the National Film Theatre alternatively laughs and sighs as he describes the series of groundbreaking cinematic developments that lit up the 1950s and 196os in response to the threat of TV. There was Circarama, Wonderama, Quadravision, Thrillerama, Smellarama, various flawed 3D systems and the brilliant Cinerama, which used 70mm film and projectors with three lenses and a 96-foot long curved screen, and still wows audiences at one of its last remaining homes in Bradford. The panoramic opening shots of Oklahoma! showed what Cinerama could do in 1955, but it was replaced by 20th Century Fox's inferior Cinemascope - though even that was mothballed in 1967. For the most part, we still watch movies using upgraded versions of technology we've had for the better part of a century; and the same is true of TV, subject of many radical space age patents, but still nothing like the sci-fi imaginings of Bradbury or Asimov. All the same, when I lament to James Dyson the lack of wall-sized TV, he exclaims: \"Oh, but we have got full-wall TV - with projectors. And they're not expensive. I have one, and you can fill a wall for about 400 quid, but I think people have got used to having a telly around, and a rather old-fashioned idea like a projector doesn't appeal. Also, sometimes companies put stuff out there without really explaining what it can do.\" Perhaps we're often happier imagining the future than embracing it. And perhaps, on occasion, it arrives so gradually that we're blind to it. When I call the R&amp;D people at Philips to complain about their failure to provide 3D TV by now, they calmly reply that they have: their system is expensive at present, but that will change. Then, later in our conversation, they complain about the fact that house keys don't function remotely, the way car keys do. And they're right: Captain Kirk didn't have to fumble around with locks in the dark. Robin Mannings, a member of British Telecom's \"futurology\" department, describes recently watching a film the company made in 1965, which attempted to illustrate what life would look like by the end of the century. \"And you know, it was pretty good,\" he says. \"We got personal computers and broadband in the home, and something like the world wide web. What made me laugh, though, was that it was based around the experience of a young couple trying to buy a house, and at the end, the woman says, 'Oh no - at this rate we'll never be able to get married!' The technical stuff was right, but they couldn't imagine how much the circumstances around marriage and cohabitation would have changed. We tend to extrapolate the particular things we're looking at and forget that everything else changes, too.\" In other words, we can imagine the future only in terms of our own present. If the flights of the space age teach us anything - and the best sci-fi writers have always known this - it's that the future is actually about us, here, now. There are surprises, though. When I mention the robots found in films and on TV programmes such as Lost In Space, and still notably absent from our own lives, Mannings offers: \"Well, yes, but there are a lot more robots around than you think. My wife bought a breadmaker a couple of years ago, and that's a robot when you think about it. We have them; they just look different from how we'd imagined. In any case, Honda recently demonstrated a robot that can walk and run. It's remarkable how good they're getting.\" Why did the space age evaporate? One answer is money. Economists know the period from the end of the second world war to 1973 as the greatest period of expansion the world has ever seen. The historian Eric Hobsbawm calls it the \"golden age\", which was followed by the \"age of crisis\", during which more pressing concerns than space ships would hold sway. For Mannings, the big disappointments are in public transport, where potentially fast, efficient, safe technology has been overlooked since the 1960s, and artificial intelligence, in which we've made \"almost no progress\". We head off into speculation about the next three decades, and suddenly we're discussing a world in which computer power will be like electricity, unseen and omnipresent (\"It will go that way sooner than you think\"), and tiny, brain-like processors will be grown in laboratories (\"Looked at one way, bacteria is a kind of processor\"), in which life and information will converge. And when I put the phone down, I laugh: now I'm at it. All the same, my mind returns to a surprising discovery made back at the beginning, when I noticed that, after a 30-year gap, flying saucer patents are appearing in numbers again. The difference being that, this time, most of them are coming out of China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2005/jun/27/oilandpetrol.news","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2005-06-27T09:52:19Z","webTitle":"Larry Elliott: The black stuff has world order over a barrel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/27/oilandpetrol.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2005/jun/27/oilandpetrol.news","fields":{"headline":"The black stuff has world order over a barrel","bodyText":"Crude oil is at $60 a barrel and rising. British motorists are paying record prices on the forecourts. The £1 litre may not be that far away. Traders on commodity exchanges are warning that a cold winter in the northern hemisphere could see prices, already up 38% since the start of the year, rise a lot further. Policymakers are clearly worried by the short-term picture. The G8 summit at Gleneagles next week will discuss the likely impact of high oil prices on the global economy and what the rich countries of the west ought to do in response. Every other surge in the price of oil in the past 30 years has been associated with a slowdown or full-scale recession in the world economy, and the fact that the increase seen since the start of 2003 has so far been shrugged off is no cause for complacency. Higher oil prices raise business costs and cut the real incomes of consumers; that means profit margins are shaved and consumer spending is blunted. The real problem, however, concerns the longer term. There is a strong possibility that what we are facing now is not simply a temporary mismatch between demand and supply that can be sorted out by Opec pumping more oil or by exploiting marginal fields in the world's most inhospitable places. Rather, it is that we are in the early stages of an energy crisis that will fundamentally affect our lives over the next few decades. If that is so, western policymakers need to be thinking hard - and thinking hard now - about what life is going to be like when the oil and gas run out. Everyone knows that oil will not last for ever. The world is not going to move from current levels of production to zero overnight; there will be a long process of gradual decline. Using techniques originally developed by M. King Hubbert to assess the profile of US oil production, industry experts can estimate, with a high degree of certainty, the high point of global output - or peak oil, as it is known. Hubbert calculated this with accuracy for the US, pinpointing the 1970s as the zenith of production. For the North Sea, peak oil was at the end of the 1990s. The world as a whole has yet to reach that point. But before you breathe a sigh of relief, consider this. If the experts are right, global peak oil could arrive in 2008. The estimates cannot be precise. It could be that a big fall in demand or the exploitation of new reserves could push the date back, but the experience of the US is that the opening-up of the Alaskan fields and drilling in the Gulf of Mexico merely shifted the date of peak oil back a few years. Once peak oil has passed, the models suggest stocks will dwindle over a period of three decades at a time when, on current trends, demand for energy will be rising strongly. In 30 years, oil production could be down by three quarters. This is a staggering figure. Two hundred and fifty years of industrialisation have been built on the availability of cheap fossil fuels, first coal, then oil and gas. It is not just our cars that depend on oil, it is our entire way of life. To take one example, the massive increase in agricultural productivity would not have been possible without oil-based fertilisers. Fossil fuels have made it possible to sustain a world population that has tripled since the 1920s. For the past century oil has been the lubricant for capitalism in a period which has seen the fastest growth, by far, in history. A world without oil is bound to represent a massive economic, social and political shock. It's not hard to construct a dystopian vision. First, there will be a power struggle over dwindling oil stocks. Already, there are signs of a new Cold War emerging as the US and China seek to curry favour with poor African countries that are seen to have potential as oil suppliers. It could get a lot worse that that. The oil junkies of the west will be like heroin addicts suffering from cold turkey: prepared to do whatever it takes to get a fix. Given that reserves of oil and gas are concentrated in parts of the world that could hardly be called politically stable, this does not bode well. Second, there is a threat of economic retrenchment. As the British scientist Colin Campbell puts it in a book published today* \"Cheap and efficient transport opened the world to trade, while the manufacture of consumer goods exploded. The new energy also transformed agriculture, providing the food for a growing population that has expanded sixfold, exactly in parallel with oil production. Oil was in turn followed by gas, increasingly used for electricity generation, which brought power and light to households throughout the world. Now as the 21st century dawns we face the onset of the natural decline of the premier fuel that made all this possible, and we do so without sight of a substitute energy that comes close to matching the utility, convenience and low cost of oil and gas.\" When we fret about whether the economy is growing by 2.5% a year or 3% we are ignoring the gorilla in the room: our way of life is unsustainable without a cheap and reliable form of energy. We may soon be waking up to lower growth, falling populations and a reduction in living standards. Indeed, without urgent policy action we are likely to get all three. So what are we doing to prevent this? Well, not a lot. The first response is to deny there is a problem and dismiss talk of a pending energy crisis as scaremongering. A second response is to say that it might be a possibility, but will occur on somebody else's watch. A third is to follow the example of Mr Micawber and assume that something will \"turn up\". That \"something\" is normally nuclear power. In the light of the potential challenge, this is an inadequate response. There is both a practical failure and a conceptual failure here. The practical failure is to see nuclear power as a magic bullet. Where it exists, nuclear has only been possible through enormous public subsidies and, as a report due to be published by the New Economics Foundation will outline later this week, the true cost of nuclear has been underestimated by a factor of three (even leaving to one side the possibility of terrorism or accidents). There has been an opportunity cost, of course. Every pound spent on nuclear could have been spent investing in cleaner alternatives such as wind, wave and solar power. Some countries have seen the light. Germany has abandoned nuclear and is heavily subsidising solar energy produced by photovoltaic cells, currently 30 times as expensive as energy produced by fossil fuels, in the expectation that the long-term investment will pay dividends. Germany, Japan and the US are the world leaders in solar power; the UK is nowhere. The conceptual failure is to assume not only that business as usual is possible, but that it is also desirable. Peak oil is likely to be the point of diminishing returns for the entire big-economy, growth-at-all-costs, free-trade, globalised model of capitalism. Factor in a 75% drop in oil production and the current strategies for production, distribution, transport and town planning don't look so clever. As energy prices soar, it will seem ludicrously wasteful to cart goods halfway round the world. Countries that do not have their own local supplies will have to pay through the nose.

Sunflower oil is light in taste and rich in vitamin E, and Valerie Dupont of the University of Leeds believes it could also prove a handy portable source for the cleanest fuel of all, pure hydrogen. Plants are already used to make an automobile fuel based on alcohol, but the exhaust contains carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants. The clean-burn future rests with the fuel cell, combining hydrogen and oxygen to yield energy and water vapour, and nothing else. The cell was invented by Sir William Grove more than 150 years ago, but remained a curiosity until the Apollo space programme in the 1960s. Now a version has been developed to drive prototype cars and buses. There is a problem: finding a source of hydrogen. At the moment, the chief source available is burning the very fossil fuels hydrogen is intended to replace. Dr Dupont and her colleagues think they may have an answer: a hydrogen generator that uses only sunflower oil, air and water vapour. The secret lies in two catalysts, one based on nickel, the other on carbon. \"Hydrogen from sunflower oil could provide a more environmentally-friendly alternative,\" she told the American Chemical Society conference in Philadelphia yesterday. Her oil comes direct from supermarket shelves - \"we'd happily toss our salad with it.\" Her generator, so far, exists only on a laboratory bench, and has yet to supply hydrogen to any fuel cells. But a similar device could deliver hydrogen to the garage forecourt to fill the fuel cells of tomorrow's cars, she said. And if salad oil does not do the trick, water could. Karen Brewer of Virginia Tech told the conference that she was working on a catalytic compound which could use solar energy to split a fuel tank full of water into oxygen and the hydrogen for fuel cells. Water is cheap. \"But, so far, our compound is expensive,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2005/feb/03/economicdispatch.economicpolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2005-02-03T15:39:15Z","webTitle":"Shelling out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/03/economicdispatch.economicpolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2005/feb/03/economicdispatch.economicpolicy","fields":{"headline":"Shelling out","bodyText":"The news that Shell last year made a profit of $17.5bn (£9.3bn) - the biggest ever by a UK company - has led to renewed calls for a windfall tax. Oil companies have made money hand over fist thanks to high demand from China and continuing political uncertainty in the Middle East. Although the price of oil has retreated from last year's peaks of more than $50 a barrel, threats of production cuts by the producers' cartel, Opec, have continued to keep it high. ExxonMobil, the world's largest oil company, this week reported profits of $25bn and Shell made a bumper profit despite its reserves scandal, the worst crisis in its history. Some people inevitably have called such mind-boggling numbers obscene. Tony Woodley, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, said: \"Such levels of excess are, quite frankly, obscene. With our pensions in crisis, these profits are 9.3 billion extra reasons for a windfall tax.\" Mr Woodley is not alone in kicking up a fuss. Martin O'Neill, the chairman of the powerful parliamentary trade and industry select committee, has also mooted the idea of a fresh tax, calling Shell's profits \"beyond the dreams of avarice\". Whenever firms report what are seen as excessive profits, the call for windfall profits is made. When HSBC made a record £7.7bn, similar noises were heard. In the case of banking, the reasons for huge profits lie largely in the fact that the sector is dominated by a handful of players. In essence, more competition is needed. As far as oil is concerned, a windfall tax on the oil giants must look very tempting to the Treasury; it would be a quick way to get its hands on an extra few billion at a time when the public finances are coming under pressure. This not the first time the oil giants have come under fire. There was a similar outcry in 2001 and there are precedents for a windfall tax under Labour. In 1997, the government raised £4.8bn from a windfall tax on privatised utilities. Gordon Brown, the chancellor, used the money to fund the \"welfare to work\" programme. Of course, the utilities did not like being hit by the taxes, but there were no legal challenges and investors took the move in their stride as the share price of those utilities did not take a hit. A windfall tax on the oil giants would be more complicated. The utilities operated pretty much in the UK, whereas companies such as Shell and BP operate worldwide. As Mr O'Neill himself admitted, it would be questionable to tax Shell and BP - which reports next week - for activities outside the UK and the government would have trouble making that stick if there was a legal challenge. Moreover, a windfall tax in the UK could spark similar moves in other countries, opening a Pandora's box of tax assaults. Mr Brown would hardly want to precipitate a chain of events that undermined some of Britain's most important companies. Nevertheless, there are sound arguments for a windfall tax, especially if the revenues are used in highly specific ways, as was the case with the utility windfall. An oil windfall tax that went towards renewable energy would be an obvious option. On present trends, Britain is unlikely to hit the government goal of meeting 10% of the country's energy needs from renewable energy by 2010. Some argue that money raised from an oil windfall tax could be used to boost investment in wind and solar power and so move Britain closer to that target. \"Oil and gas dependency is taking us into a new kind of national security crisis, breeding as it does both terrorism and climatic threat to our economies and ecosystems. I am in favour of windfall taxes that could be used to accelerate all the many means we have at our disposal of breaking this dependency,\" said Jeremy Leggett, the chief executive of solarcentury, a UK solar energy company. The issue of outsize oil profits could be looked at in another way. The environmental group Friends of the Earth (FoE) argues that such large profits are only possible because Shell and other oil companies shift the burden of pollution and climate change that is an inevitable consequence of their business on to the rest of society. Take the problem of gas flaring - the burning off of gas that comes up with the oil. According to FoE, gas flaring in Nigeria produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all of sub-Saharan Africa combined and is a major source of pollutants. \"If Shell had to pay for the damage being caused by global warming, these figures would not look so good. Shell should seek future profitability in clean and sustainable energy - not the fossil fuels that now endanger our planet,\" said FoE. · Mark Tran is business editor of Guardian Unlimited."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2005/jan/06/france.internationalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2005-01-06T00:03:56Z","webTitle":"Chirac plan may be flawed but it is bold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jan/06/france.internationalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2005/jan/06/france.internationalnews","fields":{"headline":"Chirac plan may be flawed but it is bold","bodyText":"President Jacques Chirac, the comeback political pensioner, has this week outlined a grand vision to transform France's economy and industrial base over the next decade and make of it a genuine rival to the United States - and China and India. Eschewing the cuisine minceur role for the state adopted by Blair and Brown, he has proposed no less than a new \"agency of industrial innovation\" that will promote the \"national champions\" of tomorrow in the manner of Airbus in aerospace or Ariane in space technology. Chirac, drawing on plans presented to him by Jean-Louis Beffa, the chairman and chief executive of St Gobain, the glassmaker, has come up with the idea of 10 \"programmes of mobilisation for industrial innovation.\" These include the clean (non-polluting) car, solar energy, new treatments for infectious or neuro-degenerative diseases and secure broadband networks. The new agency will be given at least €2bn over the next three years but, unlike previous examples, including Britain's ill-fated National Enterprise Board under Jim Callaghan, it promises to avoid simply being an executive arm of the state, chucking taxpayers' money at picked-out winners-or, worse, pouring it into ill-conceived and badly executed R&amp;D programmes and investment schemes dreamed up in the board rooms of nationalised industries run by énarques (graduates of France's grandes écoles such as the national administration college). Before City analysts or Treasury wonks dismiss the Chirac plans as Bonapartist folly, they merit a moment of examination. The Beffa scheme endorsed by the president sees the agency funded on a 50:50 basis by the state and private sector, with the state's share largely coming from privatisation receipts (EDF and nuclear operator Areva, say) which would normally go to reducing public debt and the budget deficit. Public money would be repayable, moreover. Large companies or a cluster of small and medium-sized firms would be in charge of both R&amp;D and investment in new programmes and products which, supposedly, would gear France away from its traditional success in autos or airframes into new territories such as information technology or bioscience. State aid would be more concentrated and, with an eye to EU rules, would be less than €100,000 (£70,000) over three years for any one firm. So, unlike Nicolas Sarkozy's rescue of Alstom last year, the aim would be to take risks for the future - a French version of Japan's MITI, perhaps. Where New Labour has allowed neo-Thatcherite-style, foreign groups to take over many of Britain's industrial crown jewels and would not blink an eye if the Chinese or Indians acquired, say, AstraZeneca, Chirac wants to invite other European countries and firms, especially German, to join his new agency. He wants the Franco-German axis to seize control of the EU's so-called Lisbon strategy to surpass the US by 2010 as \"the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world ....\" - due to be revised and updated this spring. Scoffers might point out, drawing on the recent Kok report, that the US accounts for three-quarters of the top 300 IT companies and almost half of the top 300 ranked by R&amp;D spend or that America is simply better at making productivity gains through innovation. But Airbus has proved that, with government backing, it can out-compete Boeing in the marketplace and in new technology. The Chirac plan is bold; it may be flawed. But then there's no reason why Europe should just do nothing - leaving the field clear for the Americans or the new Asian giants to clean up. Old-fashioned That said, there was more evidence yesterday that the French are still far too ready to adopt old-fashioned protectionist remedies in the face of immediate threats from globalisation. Ubisoft, the French video games firm, found an unwanted investor on its share register just before Christmas in the form of Electronic Arts, the big US games group, which has picked up a 20% stake. Almost immediately this has triggered speculation that Vivendi, the fantastical telecommunications to entertainment group forged by Jean-Marie Messier, might race to the rescue, merging its own games business with Ubisoft to create one of those French \"national champions.\" The trouble with this idea is that if it made any sense, the merger would surely have happened already - especially when Vivendi Universal Games has been up for sale for at least two years. What's more, the VUG business managed to lose a heroic €185m in the first nine months of last year, on turnover of €211m. Putting it together with Ubisoft may well produce something poisonous enough to repel Electronic Arts, but it would penalise shareholders in both companies. Ubisoft's investors - many of them international - would have their interests subjugated to those of the French state, being denied top open-market dollar for their stock. And at Vivendi, which had supposedly declared video games as a \"non-core\" sector, shareholders have simply suffered enough nonsense over the years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2004/jun/19/ethicalmoney.environment","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2004-06-19T01:27:59Z","webTitle":"Now sun power is really hot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2004/jun/19/ethicalmoney.environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2004/jun/19/ethicalmoney.environment","fields":{"headline":"Now sun power is really hot","bodyText":"Sales of solar panels are on the rise as homeowners join the battle against global warming, government bodies said this week. Growing concern about the environment, coupled with a wide range of grants and subsidies worth as much as £10,000, have encouraged households to spend between £2,000 and £20,000 on systems that cut carbon dioxide emissions and fuel bills. More than 3,000 homes in the last 18 months have been fitted with panels that heat hot water and hundreds more have been installed that generate electricity, said Clear Skies, a government-funded body charged with offering grants for renewable energy projects. The cost of installation, especially for the newer photovoltaic systems that generate electricity, is also falling making them affordable for young families. The Energy Saving Trust which promotes the use of green energy, said the need to switch to differ ent energy sources was desperately needed. The trust revealed that the explosion of digital devices - set-top boxes and DVDs - along with video recorders and TVs - will lead to a sharp rise in carbon dioxide emissions. It estimates that over the next 10 years, the UK population will buy more than 70m set top boxes, 63m TVs and 14m VCR and DVDs. The energy consumed and carbon dioxide emitted will be triple current levels. Tomorrow is SolarSunday, an annual event organised by the Solar Energy Society, that is designed to promote the environmental benefits of renewable energy. Solar panels fall into two main categories. Thermal systems use the energy of the sun to heat your hot water directly. They start at around £2,000 and can provide up to two-thirds of your hot water. You are likely to be told the price is higher if you have restricted access to the roof, a three-storey house, or lots of chimneys (they cast a shadow). If your roof is not facing somewhere between south-west and south you are likely to be warned off buying a system. A grant of £500 is available from Clear Skies to subsidise thermal systems, though this will fall to £400 from next month. A spokeswoman for Clear Skies said a government grant of £10m was due to run out in the middle of next year, but due to the popularity of solar systems, would be spent sooner without the cut. Choosing a supplier can be tricky. Many thermal installers pay their sales staff commission and have been likened to double-glazing sales people. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of homeowners finding themselves trapped in their own living rooms by a solar panel \"expert\" who refuses to leave. For a bona fide installer go to the Energy Saving Trust website. Anyway, you need to use an installer registered with the trust or Clear Skies to qualify for a grant. Solar panels that generate electricity have only been around for four or five years compared to thermal systems, some of which have clocked up 25 years' service. Chris Jardine, a solar energy researcher at the Environment Change Institute at Oxford University, says the technology is improving all the time and increasing demand has forced down prices. Grants of up 50 per cent are available to cover installation, cutting the costs even further. If the initial outlay is a problem, the systems are modular and you can start small and work up to covering your roof. There is also the benefit of recent developments in the electricity supply market and government targets imposed on supply companies. Once you have a photovoltaic system installed you can cut costs further by selling excess electricity back into the grid. All suppliers will knock this off your bill. Recently, Npower and independent supplier Good Energy, launched schemes that will pay you 5p a kilowatt hour for all the electricity you generate. They must reach targets for generating renewable energy and can include yours in their calculations if they have paid for it. That means you not only save an estimated 6p for every kilowatt hour of electricity you generate, but can add the 5p from one of these suppliers. An 8m square solar panel will generate 950 kilowatt hours and that will save £60 a year off bills. The subsidy saves another £50. A spokeswoman for installer Solar Century says anyone who approaches them purely wanting to cut their fuel bills, is discouraged from going ahead. She says the major benefit is to the environment. \"Though if you think of it as a way of investing your money, as if you would in a building society, you get a better return.\" Most photovoltaic systems have a guaranteed lifetime of 20-25 years compared to a payback time of 40-50 years.

A combination of the need to cut carbon dioxide emissions, the prospect of increasingly expensive oil and the estimated growth in the world's vehicle fleet means that only hydrogen can plug the gap, Paul Kruger, of Stanford University in California told delegates. Professor Kruger believes that the hydrogen will be produced by a combination of renewables such as wind and solar power and nuclear stations designed to produce hydrogen with surplus electricity. The conference, attended by the world's main nuclear organisations, had a series of presentations on how nuclear energy will play a vital role in changing the energy market to one which runs on hydrogen rather than oil. While a handful of buses in Britain already run on hydrogen, and BMW has designed a dual petrol/hydrogen engine, the problem was producing enough hydrogen for it to replace oil as the primary vehicle fuel, the conference heard. While many have suggested that surplus wind and solar energy can be used for electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, Prof Kruger floated the idea that nuclear power stations could also be built to provide electric power and hydrogen. Making nuclear power stations slightly larger than necessary would allow surplus electricity to produce hydrogen at very little extra cost. This could be sold to a national network of hydrogen filling stations for fuel cells for cars. The estimated growth in the world fleet of vehicles is from 900m in 2010 to 1,500m by 2050. The trick was to change the fuel from the 360bn gallons of petrol which would be used in 2010 to 260bn kg of hydrogen fuel needed 40 years later. To produce that much hydrogen, electricity production would have to be increased by between 15% and 25% more than that needed merely to keep the lights on, he said. There are 440 nuclear stations operating worldwide, but providing enough electricity and hydrogen to meet the world's needs might need up to 3,500 new nuclear stations. The advantage of hydrogen for fuelling cars is that it is that it recombines with oxygen to produce pure water as the only waste product. The Bush administration is so convinced that dual electricity and hydrogen production is the future that the US department of energy has decided to construct a demonstration nuclear reactor to produce hydrogen in Idaho Falls. Hans Forsstrom, from the European commission, said the EU was also considering the use of high-temperature reactors to produce hydrogen. The process had a \"big potential\". Klaus Scheuerer, of BMW, said it had already developed a car which could run on hydrogen or petrol. The problem was not the technology but the supply of hydrogen. \"The long-term transition to hydrogen as a source of energy is an absolute necessity. Our progress in the development of a hydrogen engine makes us confident that the road to market is a short one.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2005/jan/11/teaching.schools1","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2005-01-11T00:09:48Z","webTitle":"Critics' choice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/jan/11/teaching.schools1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2005/jan/11/teaching.schools1","fields":{"headline":"Critics' choice","bodyText":"The web Waves and sound How Sonar Works www.vexilar.com/help/tips/tip011.html Suitable for KS4/5 pupils &amp; teachers Sonar is used extensively by fishermen to locate shoals.

The book The Cup of the World, by John Dickinson Corgi Price £5.99 Age 11+yrs Part of the magic of this superb piece of storytelling is the insight it offers into a society in which the co-ordinates of knowledge and faith shift constantly. The medieval setting for the sometimes fearsome fantasy is beautifully evoked through vivid descriptive passages, and the vacillations of Phaedra, the feisty, headstrong and uncomfortable heroine. Her ill ease as she faces adulthood reflects a kingdom that rumbles with political intrigue and unrest. Lives are cheap when there is power to be won and it is her ability to trust amidst the upheaval that lies at the heart of her story. Enter the mysteriously compelling Ulfin. Dickinson's novel is structurally and emotionally complex, the kind of book that nags to be reread and whose layered narrative reveals even more to the mature reader. Readers of Jan Mark and Philip Pullman will consume it with delight - with the pleasing prospect of its two sequels. The CD-rom Electromagnetic Spectrum Channel 4 Age 11-15 yrs Price £57.57 inc VAT Electromagnetic Spectrum contains video, text, pictures and website links, together with lesson plans and activities dealing with the electromagnetic spectrum and how use is made of the different wavelengths. The CD-rom addresses key stage 3 and 4 science. The program presents video footage and supporting information around the theme of heat exchange, examining in turn an old house compared with an energy-efficient one, the uses of solar energy, the effects of exposure to the sun and evaporative cooling. The interactive task sheets provide student activities that investigate each of these areas. The video material is high quality and entertaining. It is presented in the context of everyday scenarios such as an estate agent calling to examine a property. The opportunities offered for scientific exploration are used well. The clips manage to retain both pace and rigour. Useful clipart and photographs are included. There are two lesson plans, one for each key stage. The Keeping Warm, Keeping Cool plan is aimed at 11- to 14-year-olds, while the Electromagnetic Spectrum is aimed at 14- to 16-year-olds. The task sheets offer students advice about setting up their document or presentation ready to record their findings, followed by activities designed to encourage them to examine the video and other resources for information. The activities direct students to the video material but not before they are clear about what they are looking for. The activities are all available as Acrobat Reader files so that they can be printed out or distributed in ways that suit the school's circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2004/apr/13/2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2004-04-13T00:33:17Z","webTitle":"UK news in brief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/13/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2004/apr/13/2","fields":{"headline":"In brief","bodyText":"Explosives theft from quarry Thieves have stolen a cache of explosives from a quarry in the Bolton Woods area of Bradford, police said last night.

What to do? If you don't want to go down the tin of biscuits route, here's our guide to the best vaguely sports-related present ideas going to make sure you have a great Christmas whether you've been good or bad. 1: Get away Ah, the mainstay of presents for loved ones: the weekend away. So easy, and yet so effective. No more than five minutes on www.thesportingtraveller.com, and you can bag yourself a few days across the Atlantic with all the hoorahs, hotdogs, and bare-knuckle fighting you can handle with a basketball weekend. Or take in 90 minutes at Camp Nou, your call - there are all sorts of sports-related air miles to be had. 2: iPod accessories If you know anyone who hasn't got an iPod yet and you're feeling generous, go the whole hog and sell your soul to www.store.apple.com. Or, you could rub it in and get them a host of accessories while you're shopping for the rest of your friends. We like www.ipodworld.co.uk, where you can pick up a Solio - a dashingly designed solar energy unit as wastefully indulgent as the iPod itself. They've also got iTrips (those gizmos that allow you to listen to your iPod through the nearest FM radio), cardocks, and flakjackets to keep your pride and joy scratch free. Your friends will love you for it. 3: A pair of wheels Or three wheels, in fact. According to www.trikke.com, \"The Trikke [pronounced 'trike', before you make fools of yourselves] is an innovative three-wheeled vehicle that takes the best of the popular vehicles of today and combines them into a completely new machine in form, function and riding experience. The Patented technology makes it possible for a rider to propel the Trikke forward without pushing or pedalling... just rock and roll.\" What they're saying is, you can build momentum using a kind of hip-twisting motion, which is actually pretty easy to pick up. It's a bit like skiing, only easier and without the risk of dropping off any mountains. And once you're good at it, it's certainly less embarrassing than using a scooter at the age of 35. If it's good enough for Jennifer Aniston, it's definitely good enough for us. 4: Popcorn and nachos Not literally, of course, but a great idea for film-lovers (or those irritating friends who buy everything they want as soon as they see it with no regard for you or your Christmas shopping) is a subscription to www.lovefilm.com. They're an online DVD rental company, and for as little as £9.99 a month, your loved ones can rent as many DVDs as they've time for - and they can keep them for as long as they like too. Guaranteed to go down better than that subscription to Loaded you tried last year. 5: Go crazy What better way to say I love you than to chuck your beloved down a hill at 35mph? A visit to www.experiencemad.co.uk will open up a world of activities it's hard to get insurance for, our favourite being \"sphereing\" for two. \"You and your chosen victim are strapped facing each other in the padded harnesses inside the ball, and then we roll you down the hill,\" they say. Great fun, and only £80 for the pair of you. 6: Toy boy WowWee have come up with a robot that everybody - men, women and children - want, and it would just be rude not to oblige. According to www.robosapienonline.com, the Robosapien is \"loaded with attitude and intelligence,\" and is \"the first robot based on the science of applied biomorphic robotics\" - as if you care about the last bit. You can train it to belch, for Pete's sake. 7: Something for the ladies We'd recommend a trip to The Body Cleansing and Rejuvenating Clinic, where you can ask them to pump as much water into your rear end as is required. Residential detox programmes are available for more fragile relatives, or if that all sounds like too much effort, why not invest in a smoothie maker - Kenwood have the best range going.

But Green party research suggests that something is going wrong with Britain's solar effort. For a start, the government has spent nowhere near its pledged target of £20m on solar grants over three years. In the first two years of its scheme, only 380 out of a projected 1,000 small-scale systems, and only 92 out of a projected 187 larger systems, have got any money. This could mean that no one is interested in solar power, but it also suggests that government is doing nothing to promote the scheme. \"Labour is aiming to install as many solar roofs in three years as Germany, under a Green party minister, does in a good month,\" says Green party spokesman Spencer Fitz-Gibbon. On a point of interest, most of Sharp's solar cells will be exported to Germany. But at least Wrexham gets 90 new jobs. Rural secrets Does the government have a clue what is actually going on in the countryside, or if its policies are working? Probably not, if you consider that it promised four years ago that the Countryside Agency would be measuring change in the quality of the countryside. It is only this week that any figures are being released - and then only 1990-98 ones, which predate the current government. The Campaign to Protect Rural England is particularly keen to know how the tranquillity of the countryside has changed, but these figures are not going to be released until next year - by which time the Countryside Agency will have been \"reorganised\", so it's quite probable no one will ever officially know. Legally blind Only 18% of British small businesses can name any environmental legislation, according to a survey of more than 8,000 companies. So goodness knows how many actually comply with the frightening list of laws which are already in place, or have any idea about what's about to hit them. But from now on, there's no excuse. A new Environment Agency website - www.netregs.gov.uk - gives guidelines for more than 100 industry sectors.

A humid strip of coastal rainforest in Australia's far north, the world-heritage listed region has never welcomed outsiders. But an old row about housing development has been revived by the local authority's decision to ban building on 450 privately owned plots. \"The community has a habit of splitting over anything,\" said Hugh Spencer, an ecologist and director of the Australian Tropical Research Foundation, who has lived in the area for 16 years. \"Even people who would claim to be very green are saying: 'This is my land, I can do what I want with it'.\" The Daintree has the highest number of endemic primitive plants in the world and may be the oldest rainforest. It provides a home for the endangered cassowary, a giant flightless bird found only in Queensland and New Guinea. The idiospermum, a tree found only there, is almost identical to 250m-year-old fossils of a plant thought to be the ancestor of all flowering plants. \"This has always been a place where plants and animals can hide during periods of high aridity and sea level rises, and then crawl out and recolonise when conditions become better,\" Mr Spencer said. The environment is less forgiving to humans. The rainfall can be up to six metres (236in) a year, and the heat and humidity make furniture go mouldy. The only services laid on are a road and a phone line. Power comes from solar energy and backup diesel generators; fresh water comes from the rain and waste water goes into septic tanks. In the early 1980s the Queensland government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen allowed residential development, despite the opposition of Douglas shire council and public protests prompting one of the great conservation battles of the decade. It ensured that 950 blocks of land were excluded from the world heritage area, but only half of them have been built on. The mayor of Douglas, Mike Berwick, said the council's decision to ban any development was prompted by the growing number of people wanting to swap city life for the quiet and isolation of the Daintree. \"Go back 15 years ago and you'd see 10 planning applications a year,\" he said. \"Before we voted on this it had gone up to seven applications a week, and in the past month the council has approved four clearings in endangered ecosystems. \"It's pretty hard sitting round that table while that sort of thing's being passed.\" The council has promised to compensate the landowners by buying the land at above the market price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2005/jan/01/guardiansaturdaytravelsection6","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2005-01-01T19:36:52Z","webTitle":"Easy does it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/jan/01/guardiansaturdaytravelsection6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2005/jan/01/guardiansaturdaytravelsection6","fields":{"headline":"Easy does it","bodyText":"Kapawi Ecolodge &amp; Reserve, Pastaza, Ecuador It is hidden away in the rain forest, the only \"road\" leading to it is a river, and, on foot, the nearest town is 10 days away: the Kapawi Ecolodge is about as far from everything as you could imagine.

I've never understood activity holidays since we seem to have far too much activity in our daily lives as it is. Find a culture where loafing is the order of the day and where they don't understand our need to be constantly doing things. Find somewhere you can have a hammock holiday. My most recent experience of such a place is Mexico. I went on a trip there to Zihuatanejo in the south-west earlier in the year and the first thing that struck me was the sheer quantity of hammocks. Mexicans love hammocks; hammocks are a priority. Even the humblest tumbledown shack has a hammock strung up outside it. The house where we stayed had two hammocks, one in the sun and one in the shade. It takes a while to master the art of hammock-lounging. At first I could only manage five minutes or so before I thought I ought to get out and go and help a child learn how to swim or something. But after observing the Mexicans' capability for staring into space for hours on end, I decided to put in some proper practice. Soon I was able to lie there for longer stretches without feeling the need to do something useful. My finest moment was when my two-year-old daughter fell asleep on top of me while I lounged. I stayed awake and immobile, staring at the sky and the passing pelicans, for nearly two hours. Towards the end of the holiday I had succeeded in achieving two-nap days. I came home feeling very pleased with myself, and put a hammock up in our garden. It's now in the shed because it rains all the time, but you can dream. · Tom Hodgkinson is editor of the Idler and author of How To Be Idle published by Hamish Hamilton at £12.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2004/jul/03/greenpolitics.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2004-07-03T01:19:41Z","webTitle":"UK should join solar revolution, says Hain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jul/03/greenpolitics.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2004/jul/03/greenpolitics.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"UK should join solar revolution, says Hain","bodyText":"Every new home in Britain should by law be fitted with solar panels on the roof to produce electricity, Peter Hain, the secretary for Wales, said yesterday. He said Britain was falling behind in the solar revolution, and building regulations should be altered so every new development was required to have solar electricity and water-heating panels. Mr Hain, a former energy minister, was speaking at the opening in Wrexham, Clwyd, of a production line for photovoltaic panels used to produce solar electricity. The production line at the Sharp factory will work around the clock to meet the demand from Germany and other European countries. The company said that to cope with the demand a second line would open in October, effectively doubling the factory's production. Mr Hain said his cabinet colleagues were discussing the change in building regulations as part of the government's plan to catch up with the solar revolution in Germany. Germany has increased its target of covering roofs in solar panels from 10,000 to 100,000, and spent £66m last year to get 121 megawatts of photovoltaic panels installed. Nearly all Wrexham's production will go there. Although the UK has invested £25m in solar power- £9m this year - only 10 megawatts of electricity was produced in 2003, about the same as a small wind farm and only 1% of the output of the Sizewell nuclear power station in Suffolk. Mr Hain said: \"There is no doubt the Germans have stolen a march on us in a big way. I believe that we should change building regulations so that by law every new house and development in Britain should have photovoltaic electricity production and solar panels for water heating. I know that Patricia Hewitt [the trade and industry secretary] is keen on this, and we are talking to Gordon Brown and cabinet colleagues. \"This technology is the future. Let us put it this way, if we do not switch to green energy, then our whole future as a human race is in jeopardy, or even more simply, we are doomed.\" Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of the company Solar Century, which designs solar energy systems, said he had twice as many clients wanting to install solar power in new developments than the government was prepared to support financially. \"This is an industry that needs support to get liftoff,\" he said. \"We thought when the energy white paper was published two years ago that we would get it, but so far there has been a yawning chasm between their rhetoric and what they actually do.\" Takashi Tomita, for Sharp, said: \"The UK has been slow to embrace solar because, unlike us [Japan], you have oil. But you are a country of good traders, with plenty of sunshine at least in the south.

'You can just be an ordinary person who wants to make a difference.' Her husband Douglas agrees. He admits to having looked like a bit of a hippy in the Seventies, when he once lived in a bus, but these days he is a successful businessman in the construction industry with five children and three grandkids. And he has just finished building the couple's own timber-frame home, made in Canada to their own design and shipped in three containers to an idyllic spot overlooking the sea near Looe in Cornwall. 'I'm really chuffed,' says Sarah, who has just finished painting the last cupboards with her water-based paint, which she says has been surprisingly good. And wouldn't you be? Not only are the Stewarts living in a bright and spacious, enviably chic, modern home with four bedrooms (the entire ground floor is given over to spare rooms and an extra kitchen for when the family comes to stay) and panoramic views, they feel they are doing their bit for the environment, too. 'We are making an effort,' says Doug. 'It's not rocket science. It's just a matter of practical forethought and consideration.' The thing about Super E houses is that they are built to be airtight and, therefore, incredibly energy efficient and low in carbon emissions. 'Most houses built today have 10 air changes an hour. Our target is 1.5 changes per hour,' explains Doug. By air changes, he means all the air (and the money that is spent heating it) that is lost through gaps in window frames, through floorboards, under doors, out of light sockets - the draughts that most of us take for granted and simply add another jumper or crank up the heating when temperatures fall. The Stewarts' house is a feat of insulation - 300mm of cellulose in the cathedral ceiling and 150mm in the internal walls. It is even insulated on the outside, to keep the air from getting in as well as out. Every Super E house has to pass a blower test to make sure there are no air leaks anywhere. 'If you have candles on, they last longer,' says Doug. At first, Sarah wasn't convinced. She describes herself as a 'fresh-air fiend' and was the sort of person who would turn the heating on full throttle, and open all the doors and windows to air the place. 'I didn't like the idea of a sealed house,' she admits. 'But I've relaxed into it and don't open the windows now. You're not walking from a cold hall to a hot kitchen and into a cooler living room,' she says. 'There is an ambient, calm, even temperature throughout. It takes away a lot of stress. I don't have to wear as many clothes and I don't have to lean against the radiators.' The house took less than two months to construct once it arrived on site (Douglas spent last summer preparing the ground). 'It's fairly conventional from the front except it has a glass gable and a cathedral ceiling,' says Doug. The large windows let maximum light into the house and also allow the couple to make the most of the spectacular views. Now the couple feel a real connection with the outdoors, whether there is a sea mist covering the house like a blanket or bright sunshine. 'We wanted the house to honour the privilege of being in such a great spot,' says Sarah, whose favourite place in the house is looking out from their first-floor bedroom across the sea, which turns from 'inky black to pearly pink' depending on the weather and the time of day. She also likes the way the light plays on the walls. An ex-florist, she has decorated with large tropical plants and the shadows they cast are, she says, like 'moving wallpaper'. Douglas became an apprentice bricklayer when he left school at 14. But he now sees his role as an educator - to show potential clients the alternatives to bricks and mortar. In 2002, he began a BSc in Building Process and specialised in Business Strategy for the Environment. 'I learnt what a wasteful, energy-consuming, un-eco-friendly industry it is in which I work,' he says. 'Embodied energy in the six tonnes of masonry, concrete and plastic contributes significantly to the overall CO2 emissions in the UK. The state of affairs is not sustainable.' He believes the only way forward is through timber and other renewable resources. Where possible, the couple have used sustainable, low-emission, highly efficient materials, from the bamboo floors and walls made from compressed gypsum and recycled paper, to the low-energy light bulbs and the eco-friendly soap in the bathroom. Doug recently completed a very glamorous course in sewage disposal at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales and is putting a reed bed in the garden, making them very conscious of everything they put into the water. Eventually, they hope to heat their water using solar energy but, in the meantime, have signed up with Green Energy, which aims to provide customers with electricity from renewable sources. But the couple insist they are not perfect. The kitchen units came from Magnet and are made from MDF, but it was all that the budget would allow. They say they would rather spend the money on getting the structure of the place right - cupboard doors can always be replaced, but walls can't. The project has cost £300,000 without the land, about £50,000 over budget. But it has been worth every penny. 'We're not saying we've got all the answers,' says Sarah. 'But you've got to do your bit. You've got to start somewhere.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2004/jun/19/oil.environment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2004-06-19T01:28:04Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Leggett: Are we ready for when the oil runs out?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jun/19/oil.environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2004/jun/19/oil.environment","fields":{"headline":"Are we ready for when the oil runs out?","bodyText":"Shell's chairman, Lord Oxburgh, hit the front page this week when he told the Guardian that oil- and gas-burning threatens the planet, and that unless emissions can be captured and stored below ground or under the sea, there is \"very little hope for the world\".

Hydrogen can be derived from renewable electricity by passing a current through water. There is no need to face the costly, tricky, perhaps impossible challenge of pumping greenhouse gases underground. The renewable energy family is big, varied and packed with promise. Take solar. Launching the government's energy white paper, Tony Blair concluded: \"Solar energy alone could meet world energy demand by using less than 1% of land currently used for agriculture.\" Solar cells could generate all global electricity demand using an area of the Sahara desert 600km square. Even the cloudy UK could supply more electricity than it currently consumes simply by putting solar rooftiles on every household. By mixing and matching renewable technologies any aspect of modern life could be powered reliably by renewables. All we need is imagination, the will government's usually reserve for waging war, the leadership from responsible companies and time to make the switch. Shell tells us the topping-out point for oil depletion lies far away in the 2030s. Until that point is passed, we can expect growing amounts of our drug of choice at cheap prices. Just as well, most economists say, because the world economy has evolved to a dependence on oil and gas that is akin to the animal kingdom's dependence on oxygen. Between now and 2030, they say, we have time to develop alternatives and enable a smooth transition. But suppose peak-depletion is not in 2030 but 2007, as the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas now says. If this group of pessimistic ex-oilmen and academics is right, we are close to permanent high-and-rising oil prices, with no time to develop alternatives. Global depression is around the corner. If sober Shell can sink so low as to lie about its reserves, then who else? Could the pessimists be right? Shareholders, governments, or both, need to force the oil industry to open its books. And has Shell been sitting on the survival technologies, ensuring that they stay locked up in tiny markets for the foreseeable future? At the very least, Shell has not been showing the entrepreneurial zeal for renewable energy that it has shown for a century on the frontiers of the hydrocarbon age. Shareholders, consumers and governments must force them, and all the oil companies, to change course. Unless we do, there will indeed be little hope for the world. · Dr Jeremy Leggett is the chief executive of solarcentury and a member of the government's Renewables Advisory Board www.solarcentury.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2004/nov/14/art.greenbuilding","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2004-11-14T01:36:52Z","webTitle":"Mud, mud, glorious mud","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/nov/14/art.greenbuilding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2004/nov/14/art.greenbuilding","fields":{"headline":"Mud, mud, glorious mud","bodyText":"Three years ago, Nicholas Worsley, a sixtysomething ex-barrister, was living in a conventional house in the centre of Worcester. His new home, however, designed by John Christophers of Associated Architects, is made mostly from mud. Glimpsed from underneath the duvet in the guest bedroom, the straw and pebbles that keep the dried mud from cracking too much are disconcerting reminders of what lies beneath the surface of domesticity. It comes as something of a shock in a new house, something like the first taste of nose-to-tail cuisine for a generation reared on fish fingers, to allow primitive mud into the domestic world. We rely on our homes to shelter us from nature, not rub our faces in it. Mud walls are not for everyone. 'You need to like wild life,' says Worsley, who has become used to sharing the house with several spider colonies. But mud, or cob as it is known when it is used as a building material, is very cheap. And when you go with the flow, you start to see its aesthetic qualities, more like a seamless three-dimen sional Richard Long wall piece than homespun craftwork. Mud also has a whole lot of advantages when it comes to energy saving. As the wine cellar, art collection, Bose stereo system and the Danish TV set in his living room suggest, Worsley is no puritan, even if every aspect of the house has been designed to minimise damage to the environment. The wine racks are made from sheets of what look like chipboard, but are actually recycled plastic bottle tops. His lavatories, washing machine and garden hose use rainwater carefully collected from the roof. On a sunny morning, Worsley can look forward to the pleasure of a hot bath in the evening, unsullied by the slightest contact with an immersion heater. 'I am not a revolutionary,' he says. But even a decade ago, it would have been inconceivable for somebody like Worsley to have built a house like this in among the comfortable detached houses and Betjemanite tennis clubs of his suburban neighbours. The fact that he has is a measure of how far we have come as much as how far we still have to go in worrying about what our homes are doing to the planet. The house shelters behind its thick mud wall. To stop the mud being washed away, it has to be protected top and bottom, with, respectively, a corrugated iron lid, to shed rain water, and a stone plinth, to stop rising damp. Behind the long, thick curve of the wall, the house takes the form of a series of lean-to oak boxes, ranged around the garden and aligned to give living room and kitchen a view over the Severn and its flood plain. If our grandchildren are to stand any chance of a future in which the weather bears even a passing resemblance to ours and of escaping a never-ending series of not so low intensity wars for control of what little is left in the way of crude oil, natural gas and water, we are going to have to do more than give up our Chelsea tractors and disable the stand-by mode for our plasma screen TVs. Whether that something is to take up living in houses made like Nicholas Worsley's is another issue. Certainly, mud walls are not necessarily what the government has in mind with its newly introduced sustainability laws intended to shape the building of all of Britain's new homes. But the number of people like Worsley who do take the energy issues that face anyone who builds a house seriously is growing. And their approach has become increasingly sophisticated. It's not enough anymore to slap a couple of solar panels on the roof. The energy taken to build a house, as well as its energy consumption in use, is becoming an issue. A heavy mass gives a house good energy performance in use, but hauling heavy loads of concrete around the country is a profligate use of resources. Sometimes the answer is to use builders' rubble and straw bales, as in Sarah Wigglesworth's celebrated house in north London. Elsewhere, as in the case of Worsley's, it's mud. The clay comes from a nearby building site and would otherwise have been dumped in a landfill. It was laid by hand, saving not just on transport costs but also on the energy needed to make bricks. But in the end, the most significant energy cost of all is determined by where we build our houses and how close together they are. Suburbs, like, it has to be said, Worsley's particularly leafy bit of Worcester, are too spread out to support a bus service, let alone an underground line. That makes them dependent on the private car, even if his architect did make a point of coming to site meetings on his bicycle. Build them and no amount of retro-fitted energy-saving measures will ever make them habitable once petrol becomes as costly as Chateau Yquem. Worsley confesses with a tinge of guilt to taking low-cost flights to his other house in France as a cheaper, more convenient alternative to packing five people into his car to drive there, and regrets not using windpower or photovoltaics. But his motivation was as much aesthetic as ecologically driven. A house as far as he is concerned is not simply a machine to convert solar energy into hot water. 'I looked at pictures of a lot of eco houses and most of them are very boring architecturally. They made the point about energy saving, but that was about it. I wanted to do more than that. We looked at rammed earth as an alternative to mud but I felt it was wrong for the site, I wanted to keep an agricultural feel. Rammed earth would have looked too crisp and clean.' By contrast, Worsley's wall is like a big, brown haystack. 'Building it was a pleasure in itself. It was like making mudpies, glorious fun and satisfyingly low-tech. You just pitchfork it on in piles, leave it 10 days and then finish it off with a sharp spade.' And, in the end, that sense is what comes through the house. It's an advertisement as much for the pleasure to be had in building a house for yourself as a manifesto for sustainability."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2005/jan/08/guardiansaturdaytravelsection1","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2005-01-08T18:28:04Z","webTitle":"Island flings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/jan/08/guardiansaturdaytravelsection1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2005/jan/08/guardiansaturdaytravelsection1","fields":{"headline":"Island flings","bodyText":"House of Korina, Chios, Greece Where is it?

The Alaskan oil tanker spill of 1989 is important not only because it caused an environmental catastrophe but also because of the way Exxon, led by chairman Lawrence Rawl, made a complete dog's dinner of its response. The spill cost Exxon some $7 billion (£4 billion) in fines and clean-up costs, much of which might have been avoided if it had acted more quickly and decisively. To compound matters, Mr Rawl's suspicious and hostile handling of the world's media was a public relations disaster for the firm. As a result, the phrase Exxon Valdez entered the lexicon as shorthand for corporate arrogance. It also signalled the start of a shift in the business world's perception of its place in the wider community. \"Exxon Valdez was a real turning point. The company never expected the reaction it got,\" says Neela Bettridge, director of corporate social responsibility (CSR) consultancy Article 13. She argues that nowadays, with the internet making it easier for information about employers - good and bad - to be flashed around the globe and greater awareness among employees about their rights, businesses are realising the need to be transparent. They can no longer afford to operate in glorious isolation as money-making machines. They have to recognise their impact on, and responsibility towards, the communities in which they operate. What this means on the ground is harder to pin down. Ask six different firms what they mean by corporate social responsibility (CSR) and you'll probably get six different answers. \"People often do not understand what business is about, they can have a really negative view of large corporations and can be hugely suspicious of corporate motives. So it's about reaching out to say 'this is what we do and these are our moral principles and how we are going to do business',\" stresses John Drummond, chief executive of consultancy Integrity Works. If this all sounds somewhat touchy-feely, well, to a degree, it is. But businesses are not generally renowned for being philanthropic, and amid the warm words there are some tough business imperatives behind this shift. A study by the Work Foundation in March, for instance, made a direct correlation between companies being committed to CSR and improved productivity and performance. When office copier and printer maker Ricoh banished bins from its office in Telford, Shropshire, it raised a few eyebrows among the 600 or so staff, admits environmental officer Andy Whyle. But the move has seen it cut its bill for sending waste to landfill sites from £60,000 to £15,000. \"In fact we are now generating revenue because we are being paid for sending material to be recycled off site, and are making about £37,000 a year,\" says Mr Whyle. Instead of individual bins, employees use recycling points around the building. \"People soon got the hang of it, and we made sure senior managers were participating. It's now a big thing with staff, and helps them to feel involved,\" he explains. Another important factor in the shift in attitudes is fear. Wariness of being branded an environmental hooligan or splashed across the headlines because you've been caught investing in an unsavoury regime, say, has been one catalyst. The fear of being caught out internally, in your accounting or your sourcing of goods, or the way you treat suppliers and customers, has been another. There has also been the realisation that if you don't develop your moral, social and environmental credentials you'll lose your best staff because they'll think someone else is a better employer. All these elements can have a disastrous effect on a company's bottom line. \"You can no longer separate the health and safety, environmental and social activities of a company from its pure manufacturing activities,\" says Robert Wise, spokesman for BP. The energy giant operates a wide range of CSR programmes around the world, from developing more sustainable fuels, such as solar energy, to supporting wildlife sanctuaries. If BP is negotiating for a new development, the idea that it is prepared to put investment back into the community helps tremendously, he says. \"Rather than being an add-on, it is now part of the groundwork that you do for future business.\" CSR can help businesses anticipate and react better to future legislation, regulation and business issues, adds Andy Taylor, director of corporate citizenship at Ford, another firm strongly committed to CSR. It operates a scheme whereby staff can take 16 days' paid leave a year for community-based projects. For the past three years Julie Finlay, quality manager at Ford's Daventry parts distribution centre in Northamptonshire, has taken time out to help run \"leadership skills\" days at a local grammar school in Rugby. \"We do both outdoor and indoor tasks, things like paper survival games. We run it like a mini assessment centre,\" says Ms Finlay. As well as adding to Ford's reputation locally, the programme brings significant benefits for the employees taking part, she believes. \"It has given us a lot of respect for Ford. It's also given people the confidence to adjudicate and monitor others. And because we have worked as a team outside work, it has improved us as a team inside work. It has broken down inter-departmental barriers,\" she adds. It is the role of employees and what they get out of it that, in many ways, can make or break a company when it comes to CSR. Doling out money to charities or spending cash on green projects means little if you treat your staff like dirt, screw down your suppliers until they squeal and revel in a culture of secrecy, deceit and bullying. Too often, as we will see next week, the good intentions of CSR can be let down by the grim reality of making a profit in a tough economic environment, leaving employees cynical and disillusioned. A study by management training school Roffey Park in April, for example, found that, while four out of 10 organisations published CSR statements, just 6% said what they did was driven by staff. \"There is an assumption among a lot of people that companies talk a good talk but in practice it is always shareholder needs that dominate,\" argues Linda Holbeche, research director at Roffey Park. \"The gap in rhetoric is huge.\" Many employers do genuinely believe in CSR and are seeing real benefits from it for themselves, their staff and communities. Others have learned only one lesson from the Exxon Valdez: that good PR pays dividends.

The Alliance of Small Island States, some of the smallest countries in the world and the most vulnerable to climate change, desperately need the £30m relief fund agreed by the climate change conference in Milan to help them adapt to environmental changes. But the release of the funds depends on the agreement between the 120 countries party to the Kyoto protocol, which deals with the reduction of carbon dioxide levels. Enele Soponga, chairman of the alliance and ambassador to the UN of the Pacific island of Tuvalu, said his country and its 12,000 people would be the first to go under. The main island had been inundated three times this year. Vegetable plots had been washed away and there was no drinking water. Some families had moved to New Zealand, but older people wanted to stay. \"To survive the dry periods we now need desalination plants run by solar energy, but we have no money for that, we need help from countries that created the emissions,\" he said. He said neighbouring Kiribati and the Marshall Islands, with 80,000 people each, were also close to sinking. EU ministers were leading most of the developed world in hoping to postpone to May 2005 the meeting of the parties to the climate change convention, in the hope that after the Russian and US presidential elections next year the political process of tackling the climate could be brought back on track. The Kyoto protocol, which was heralded as a great breakthrough in 1997 when the developed world signed legally binding targets for reduced greenhouse gas emissions, is in limbo until Russia decides to ratify it. Ministers have no plan B, and are banking on Russia keeping its pledge to take part - which would give the treaty legal force. President Vladimir Putin seems to be using Russia's role in keeping the treaty alive as a bargaining chip to gain concessions from the EU on oil and gas prices in World Trade Organisation trade talks. The Russians have been making contradictory statements about their intentions during the Milan conference. Further commitments were on the agenda for Milan, but were never discussed. Instead of being postponed until 2005, the ministerial conference will now take place next year, as was originally planned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2004/apr/27/furthereducation.uk5","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2004-04-27T01:08:11Z","webTitle":"One, two, three, success!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/apr/27/furthereducation.uk5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2004/apr/27/furthereducation.uk5","fields":{"headline":"One, two, three, success!","bodyText":"To win centre of vocational excellence status (Cove) for one of your college programme areas is pretty good going - to gain two is excellent. But to achieve a third is pretty extraordinary. And yet that is just what one north London college has done. The College of North West London in Brent is only one of four colleges in the country to hold three Cove awards, in technology. Vicki Fagg, its principal, is revelling in her college's triple-Cove status. It has, she says, enabled the college to make a substantial capital investment in its Willesden-based training campus. The Coves have brought an additional £1.35m of funding so far. The money has been invested in state-of-the-art teaching and learning equipment. At the time the third Cove was awarded - for fabrication and welding - in December, Frank Horan, head of the college's technology faculty, described himself as \"ecstatic\". Half a dozen colleges have one Cove and another Cove in partnership with other colleges. But the College of North West London is rare in having two in its own right and a third - in welding - shared with Keighley College in West Yorkshire and the People's College in Nottingham. The Willesden faculty's first Cove was in refrigeration, air conditioning and electrical installations. This was awarded in 2002. This Cove will contribute skilled workers to work on air conditioning and refrigeration units at Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 5 as well as working on other big London building projects. This was quickly followed by a second Cove in construction, which encompasses bricklaying, carpentry, construction management, gas fitting, heating and ventilation, joinery, painting and decorating, plastering and plumbing. There are 1,200 students enrolled on these courses. Then the college, one of the UK's main welding centres, was approached by the Welding Institute about the possibility of establishing a third Cove in welding. \"We are the only college-based centre in the UK that offers all the American and European welding codes,\" Frank Horan says. \"Our provision is totally unitised, and allows students to complete a full qualification, or a unit leading to a qualification, in 12-week cycles. This flexibility particularly meets the needs of both industry and employed individuals. Nobody else offers provision in this way. \"Industry supports us because we can customise our provision to their needs, and they also recognise that the quality of work we provide is the best to be found. Our specialist teachers are acknowledged by both industry and FE inspectors, who awarded top grades to plumbing in three successive inspections.\" In partnership with other universities and colleges in the Thames Valley corridor, the college gained New Technology Institute status in 2002 from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). The college has 7,000 student enrolments and more than 130 staff. The college is a major national centre for refrigeration and welding. It has more than 500 students in training and is responsible for more than 60% of all level 3 NVQs awarded annually. The faculty is also seen as the major centre for electrical installation in London and the south-east. It has more than 700 students in training and provision includes technician training and craft training activities. Horan says that the additional funds Cove status brought with it had enabled the college to upgrade its equipment, improve its teaching and learning spaces and support the introduction of new foundation degrees and also hydrogen fuel-cell and solar- energy courses. Last week Ivan Lewis, the minister for skills and vocational education, formally opened another centre of training excellence, although not a Cove - the Heathrow Construction Training Centre. This will train the skilled construction workforce needed to build the airport's new Terminal 5. London West learning and skills council and BAA Heathrow have teamed up to deliver a local labour strategy that aims to increase the number of skilled workers in areas around Heathrow. In September 2002 they formed the Heathrow Employment Forum, a partnership between BAA, the LSC, the construction industry and various public authorities, to put in place a new construction training network for 14- to 19-year-olds. The flagship initiative in this network is the Heathrow Construction Training Centre. This facility will train more than 200 young modern apprentices over three years. Carillion Construction Training, a national training provider, runs the centre and employs the apprentices on a trainee wage for a 14-week intensive training programme, followed by hands-on work experience on local development sites or at Heathrow. More than 80 modern apprentices aged 16-19 are undertaking training in carpentry and joinery and bricklaying. The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board also plans to use the centre to establish the south of England's only training facility for steel erection.

The arrival makes Mars a relatively crowded place. There are already three satellites in orbit around the red planet and the six-wheeled rover Opportunity was the third landing on Mars since Christmas Day. The first, the British Beagle 2, has been silent since its Yuletide arrival at a plain called Isidis. The second, Spirit, a twin of Opportunity, made a successful landing on January 4 at a place called the Gusev crater, but ran into serious communication problems on Wednesday. On Friday, it began to transmit again, giving engineers enough evidence to identify a software flaw which they hope to correct. But this could take weeks. So the successful landing of Opportunity was greeted with more than the usual jubilation. In the last four decades more than half of all missions to Mars have come to grief. To make a safe landing, Opportunity had to hit the Martian atmosphere at just the right angle, survive a sudden burst of intense heat as it ploughed through the thin air of the planet, open a parachute, then fire a set of retro rockets, and finally inflate a set of airbags to cushion its impact with the arid rocks of Mars. One engineer called such a descent \"six minutes of terror\". Then the rover had to settle the right way up, flip away its inflated cocoon, unfold its solar panels, and prepare to send a postcard home to mission control 100m miles away in Pasadena, California. \"I came here prepared for a funeral,\" said Ed Weiler, second in command at Nasa. \"Talk about a rollercoaster ride: I saw the resurrection of one rover and the birth of another.\" Like Spirit before it, Opportunity will stay on its landing platform, gathering up solar energy and checking its faculties before trundling off with its stereoscopic, eye-level camera and geological tools to investigate its new home and look for evidence of water on the parched planet. The Americans chose the Gusev touchdown because it looked like an old lake bed. They selected Meridiani because it seemed to be rich in the mineral haematite, normally linked with water. But the two rovers are, in effect, only geologists. Water is a prerequisite for life, but neither Spirit nor Opportunity is designed to look for signs of life. Beagle 2, put together by a British consortium led by the Open University's Colin Pillinger, would have been the first working biologist on Mars. It was the first robot specifically engineered to probe beneath the Martian surface to \"sniff\" for telltale organic chemicals usually linked with life. Mission scientists have not yet entirely given up hope, but its silence has been a cruel blow. The pain was softened a little on Friday, however, by the first data from Beagle's mothership, Mars Express, which has begun to send back stunning images of the planet. It has also begun a search for water by radar and other sensing instruments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2003/oct/26/greenpolitics.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2003-10-26T01:46:27Z","webTitle":"Boost for off-shore wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/oct/26/greenpolitics.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2003/oct/26/greenpolitics.politics","fields":{"headline":"Boost for off-shore wind power","bodyText":"Plans for massive expansion of wind farms on British land are threatened by public protest, and hopes for large-scale solar power generation are over-ambitious, Ministers will be warned this week. Instead the Government's own company, set up to invest in renewable energy technology, will urge that public funding be concentrated on supporting off-shore wind turbines and more futuristic wave and tidal power. On-shore wind farms are a key part of government plans to cut carbon emissions by 60 per cent by 2050, but Ministers have kept alive hopes for other 'green' energy sources. The report by the Carbon Trust, to be published this week, says Ministers should concentrate investment on renewable energies that are likely in future to be cheaper, and boost the economy. The best on-shore wind farms charge prices competitive with gas-fired power stations. But the report warns that public protests against the visual intrusion of wind turbines could put a stop to new farms in a decade. And it says Britain would not gain much in jobs or investment because the market is already dominated by Danish firms. It was also negative about solar energy: the technology would be much more expensive than other power in 2020, British businesses had lost out to the Japanese industry, and these challenges were exacerbated by lack of sun. Instead the report recommends more support to develop bigger offshore wind farms, which could become cheaper than on-shore wind power, and generate more investment and jobs. This would require government to make planning permission easier to get and to give long-term security that investment costs could be recovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2004/may/06/research.science1","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2004-05-06T01:46:33Z","webTitle":"Welcome to WaterCube, the experiment that thinks it's a swimming pool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/may/06/research.science1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2004/may/06/research.science1","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to WaterCube, the experiment that thinks it's a swimming pool","bodyText":"Theoretical physicists know they are being taken seriously when someone builds an experiment to check their predictions. These experiments can be small, so-called table-top affairs, or they can be enormous enterprises involving miles of underground tunnels. However, construction engineers in Beijing are currently building a very different monument to theoretical physics - the National Swimming Centre for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. The architects who designed the futuristic aquatic venue drew their inspiration from theoretical research into the structure of foams carried out by two physicists at Trinity College in Dublin. The story starts in 1887 - nine years before the first modern Olympics in Athens - with the great Victorian physicist Lord Kelvin. What, Kelvin asked himself, was the most economical way to divide space into cells of equal size with the least surface area between them? Kelvin proposed a solution in which the cells - which could, for example, be the soap bubbles in a foam - were 14-sided shapes called tetrakaidecahedra. For more than a century Kelvin's structure remained the most efficient way to divide space. Then, in 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan used a computer program called Surface Evolver to find a new solution to the problem that was 0.3% better than Kelvin's. Three quarters of the cells in the Weaire-Phelan structure have 14 sides, while the rest are dodecahedra with 12 sides. Both cells have the same volume. A decade later, Weaire and Phelan's record still stands and the £60m National Swimming Centre based on their structure is taking shape in the Chinese capital. When it is finished in 2006, the arena - which is also known as the Water Cube - will cover a floor space of 70,000sq metres and have room for 17,000 spectators. The building will have a steel frame based on a modified version of the Weaire-Phelan structure and will be coated with a transparent form of Teflon, called ETFE. The Water Cube was chosen from 10 proposals in an international competition and was designed by two Australian companies, PTW Architects and the Arup Australasia engineering group, together with the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) and the CSCEC Shenzhen Design Institute. PTW and Arup had previously worked together on the Aquatic Centre for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. So what attracted a group of architects hoping to design an Olympic sports venue to something that people might think is arcane physics research? \"It is an ever-increasing issue for all architects to find inspiration and the basis for design solutions,\" says Kurt Wagner of PTW, \"and often our imagination is just not enough. \"For this project we were researching the meaning and relevance of water, and we were intrigued by images of foam, soap bubbles, molecules and corals, and the organic structures behind them,\" he explains. \"Then we became interested in what a uniform structure that occupied three-dimensional space might look like, and we came across the original Kelvin foam on the web.\" Although the Kelvin structure did not have the organic quality the team was looking for, it led them to the work of Weaire and Phelan. Wagner says they rotated a bit of Weaire-Phelan foam and a subsequent slice through the structure was more to their liking. Although the Weaire-Phelan structure contains just two different shapes, by the time the architects had finished with it they needed one hundred or so different shapes. The team did not simply integrate the Weaire-Phelan foam into a traditional building design but took a radically new approach. In a conventional stadium, the walls, roof and so on are supported by a system of columns, cables and other structural elements. In the Water Cube, on the other hand, they are all one and the same. \"What we did was cut the overall shape of the building out of the foam structure, and then carve the internal spaces from the inside of the same piece of foam,\" Wagner says. \"The resulting structure is seamless from wall to roof and back down again.\" At first glance, a foam design might appear less robust than a more conventional structure, but appearances can be deceptive. Indeed, Wagner points out that seismic activity is a major worry for architects in Beijing, and says that the Water Cube design is ideally suited to absorbing the energy from earthquakes. Swimming pools require a lot of heating and the Water Cube has been designed to be highly energy efficient. Some 90% of the solar energy falling on the building will be trapped within the structure and used to heat the pools and other areas. Not surprisingly, swimming pools get through a lot of water, but very little rain falls in Beijing. The designers have overcome this problem by recycling most of the \"backwash\" that would normally be drained away, and by storing whatever rain does fall on the building to top up the pools. And how does Denis Weaire - who will not make any money from the design - feel about his work being immortalised in an Olympic venue? \"Any immortality goes with the structure itself, and that is still debatable,\" he says. Indeed, no one has proved that the Weaire-Phelan structure is the most economical way to divide space. However, Weaire is confident. \"Will it ever be surpassed or disproved? I think not.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2004/jun/25/ethicalbusiness.economicdispatch","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2004-06-25T12:50:37Z","webTitle":"Ethical powerhouse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jun/25/ethicalbusiness.economicdispatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2004/jun/25/ethicalbusiness.economicdispatch","fields":{"headline":"Ethical powerhouse","bodyText":"Juliet Davenport sees the retail electricity market as a jungle. \"It is a finite market; you win a customer at the expense of somebody else, so it's very competitive,\" says the 36-year-old chief executive of Good Energy, a company that supplies only 100% renewable electricity from wind power, small-scale hydro plants and solar power. Most people have direct experience of what Davenport is talking about. It is not unusual for people to receive an unsolicited visit from representatives of an electricity company, perhaps a callow youth from France or Australia, promising them cheaper bills if they switch suppliers. Davenport gets quite agitated about these latter-day Willie Lomans and wishes the government would crack down hard on \"bad doorstep selling\", as she puts it. \"There have been fines, but doorstep tactics are still the best way of getting customers, and to allow the market for renewables to blossom, there must be a close watch on such practices,\" she argues. The renewable energy companies in the UK can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Besides Good Energy, there is Green Energy and Ecotricity. This new market is minuscule at the moment, as only 2.8% of the energy the UK consumes comes from renewable sources, mostly from hydro-electric plants. Figures show that, last year, of the UK's 29 million electricity customers, only 60,000 people switched to green tariffs with utility companies. For Davenport, one of the keys to turning people on to green energy is educating them. \"It's crucial for the government to reach out and communicate with people in an intelligent way,\" she maintains. She cites a campaign on TV and radio in 2003 that featured domestic scenes with \"farting fridges\" and other badly behaved appliances shouting abuse at their owners. The campaign was supposed to encourage people to buy energy-efficient appliances but failed to advise people on how to do so. \"We need correct government frameworks, particularly in terms of consumers. Information about the market is not easily available, so we need a one-stop shop for advice on what to do about climate change in your home and business,\" she says. To be fair to the government, there is quite useful information on green energy on some of its websites, including that of Ofgem, the gas and electricity regulator, and of the Energy Saving Trust, set up by the government to promote the efficient and sustainable use of energy. Still, Davenport's criticism that government action is failing to meet its rhetoric is widely shared. Few people believe that Britain will reach the government's stated target of drawing 10% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. One of the most common gripes against renewable energy is that it is more expensive than conventional power. Environmental groups say one of the reasons for this disparity is that government grants for using solar energy are limited in number and discriminate in favour of the better-off. In most cases, they argue, individuals have to find a large sum of money up front before they can get a grant. Davenport maintains, however, that solar panels should be seen as an investment in a house, like putting in a new boiler, and that their costs are dropping. In this testing market, Good Energy has just fewer than 10,000 customers. The latter obviously believe in the cause of renewable energy because they would pay lower electricity bills with a conventional utility. In its most optimistic scenario, Good Energy would increase its customers to 500,000, by the end of 2008. At the very least, Davenport thinks Good Energy could have 100,000 customers within the next five years. Davenport says the market is big enough for Good Energy and other renewable-power companies to survive. Far more difficult is competing with the traditional suppliers, such as Npower, Powergen and British Gas. Her fear is that these giants will move in and destroy their renewable rivals if they see them as a threat. That is why she has such a bee in her bonnet about \"mis-selling\". She also wants to see a robust certification regime to make sure that those who claim to be selling green electricity are really doing so. \"We welcome sellers of green electricity but we want to make sure it's green,\" she says. Good Energy is recommended by Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, and has the highest ranking in the Good Shopping Guide, based on research by the Ethical Consumer Research Association. Moreover, it was recently audited by a highly respected firm to verify its claims about its product. There is no doubting Davenport's determination and focus. When its original, German parent company decided to sell Good Energy (then called Unit (E)), she raised £640,000 by selling shares to 600 of the company's customers to acquire it. The shareholders form the Monkton group, an independent company specialising in renewable energy. Earlier this month, Monkton issued a £3m share offering, mainly in order to acquire further stakes in renewable energy plant. The rest of the money, up to £300,000, will pay for marketing programmes to increase the number of Good Energy's of customers. \"Monkton's declared mission is 'to keep the world a habitable place through the development of the market for renewable electricity',\" the share prospectus declared. The company get its electricity from generators in Cornwall, Devon, Cumbria, north Wales and the Midlands, with 88% coming from wind power, 12% from small-scale hydroelectric plant and a small amount from solar power. Eventually, the company hopes to acquire its own generating plant. Davenport became interested in energy when she worked for the European commission in Brussels on the geopolitics of oil and gas and then on carbon taxation, in the European parliament. After a year, she came away convinced that the west could not preach to developing countries about the dangers of climate change unless it made changes of its own. She returned to the UK in 1993 to finish a degree in environmental economics at Birkbeck College, to add to the physics degree she already had from Oxford, and the went to work for a consultancy. From that came the idea for Good Energy, which entered the electricity market in December 1999 to sell renewable electricity to residential and business customers, initially in England and Wales and now also Scotland. Davenport realised early on that Good Energy should focus on the retail market and avoid the mistakes that other companies were making. \"The whole area was very wide and people were easily distracted by new technology such as hydrogen fuel cells and biomass,\" she says. \"There was too much emotion and time being wasted. You have to focus on what you can actually do.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2004/jan/08/guardianleaders.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2004-01-08T02:53:15Z","webTitle":"Leader: The death of species","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/jan/08/guardianleaders.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2004/jan/08/guardianleaders.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"The death of species","bodyText":"If the world needed a fresh wake-up call about the dangers of global warming, then it got it yesterday with the release of a report by distinguished international scientists predicting that climate change will threaten extinction for a quarter of all land animals and plants by 2050. This is based on a mid-range forecast of possible outcomes. At the high end as many as 58% of species could become extinct, and even at the lower end of the range, it would be disastrously high at 9%. The report - published in the journal Nature - claims to have been prepared by the largest collaboration of scientists ever to apply themselves to the problem. They studied six biodiversity-rich regions around the world, covering 20% of the planet's land area. One example of the findings is that all but three of 24 species of endemic butterflies in Australia may no longer be able to survive by 2050. This is not just a problem of individual species, because species depend on each other, so the disappearance of 25% could have multiplying effects that are difficult to quantify. What can be done? The problem has been caused by the build-up of greenhouse gases by human activities. One of the scientists involved, Professor Chris Thomas of the University of Leeds, says that \"an immediate and progressive\" switch to technologies that produce little or no greenhouse gases, combined with active removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, could save over a million species from extinction. The usual response to the problem of global warming is to blame governments. They certainly carry a great deal of the responsibility for the state we have got into and also hold most of the levers that could instigate long-term change. It is scandalous that while the UK is more or less on target to meet the - exceedingly modest - requirements of the Kyoto agreement to reduce greenhouse gas output by 12.5% by 2010, the US is 30% over what would have been its target had the Bush administration not kicked Kyoto into touch. Britain, it must be admitted, was helped fortuitously by the unrelated decline of its polluting coal-mining industry, but that does not excuse the behaviour of the US, which is concentrating its efforts on spending on research and development into energy conserving techniques such as fuel cells and solar energy. That is fine and much needed, but it does nothing to solve the problem of global warming in the short term. Although governments undoubtedly have a leading role to play, there are plenty of things that individuals can do that could make a dramatic difference. For instance, as the Environment Agency has pointed out, if every driver took one fewer car journey a week averaging nine miles, it would cut carbon dioxide emissions from traffic by 13%. Is that too much to ask? Among 60 actions recommended by the EA to improve the environment that could be taken with minimum effort are: having a shower rather than a bath, putting a \"hog\" in the lavatory cistern, recycling household rubbish, disposing of household chemicals carefully, encouraging wildlife in the garden and composting vegetable cuttings. Americans could act to reduce pollution, despite the stance of their government, by driving less powerful cars or turning down the air conditioning. One of the biggest hurdles is the difficulty of raising public awareness about the grave nature of the problem, given that reports in the past predicting potentially cataclysmic scenarios have not - so far - happened. This report seems particularly authoritative and its conclusions have even surprised some of the scientists taking part. The government should make sure that its conclusions are widely spread. And if Mr Blair could use his special relationship with America to stuff a copy in the president's back pocket, that would be an added bonus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2004/aug/08/shopping.ethicalliving","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2004-08-08T15:41:34Z","webTitle":"Q & A: Lucy Siegle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/aug/08/shopping.ethicalliving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2004/aug/08/shopping.ethicalliving","fields":{"headline":"The ecologist","bodyText":"This Q &amp; A format was made for ethical living. It's all questions really: Why should I buy this? Who made it? What conditions do they work in? Some might say we only have the luxury of asking questions because we're part of a consumer society. That's probably true. If we were among the 2.8bn people worldwide who survive on less than $2 a day, we wouldn't have time to ask. In that way I'm pleased to be on this side of the consumerist fence. However, according to the research organisation Worldwatch Institute, excessive consumption also brings higher levels of obesity and debt, severe time shortages and a degraded environment. Counteracting these problems means rethinking a lot of unthinking behaviours. Living more ethically requires a Miss Marple-like fastidiousness when it comes to shopping and demands questioning almost all bits of received wisdom. But the strange thing is, once you get over the fallacy of the convenience of modernday life, living more ethically becomes a liberating antidote to the live-to-work consumer culture. You ask the questions Q I dye my hair dark, but now I'm worried by reports that hair dye is bad for my health. What's the alternative? Belinda, Exeter A The Romans used vinegar and the Elizabethans a mix of potash and rhubarb. Our age favours a brew of chemical carcinogens, slathered on to the highly sensitive scalp, where toxins can be absorbed into the bloodstream. So you're right to be concerned. To get rid of grey, you really have to use a permanent dye and this will normally bring you into contact with arylamines - pernicious chemicals linked to bladder cancer. We should also spare a thought for the professional crimpers who spend all day mixing and applying this stuff. A Swedish study found increased risk of birth defects for the children of hairdressers exposed to some hair dyes. I like the attitude in Aveda salons. The emphasis is on fewer toxic products which give more natural-looking results and on avoiding petroleum-based ingredients (conventional dyes are full of non-renewable petroleum ingredients). Some 99 per cent of ingredients in Aveda's demi-permanent dyes and 97 per cent of ingredients in permanent dyes are made from plant-based ingredients. Alternatively, try a DIY solution, with a brand certified by the Soil Association. Aubrey Organics is a US brand, relatively new to these shores. The EU has been famously tardy in outlawing the testing of cosmetics on animals - now scheduled for 2013 - but Aubrey Organics has shunned testing for 33 years, nor will it accept any historical animal testing results. Q Should I put my paper out for the recycling collection or shred it and put it in my composting bin? Catherine, Brixton A After kitchen waste, paper is the second biggest ingredient in bins and 5m tonnes gets dumped in landfill sites every year. Less than half is recovered, even though the paper industry wreaks havoc ecologically with industrial harvesting of virgin forests and the carving of logging routes into remote ecosystems. Paper bleaching, along with plastics manufacture, is also the biggest source of dangerous dioxin emissions. Save crumpled or soiled paper for the compost bin. You needn't shred it first. (Definitely don't shred it to be recycled; the short fibres make it difficult to recover.) Instead, scrunched-up paper creates air pockets in the compost mix, helping your heap or bin to thrive. The best home for shredded paper is in a worming bin, where it makes great bedding (another way of diverting waste from landfill). Q Is it OK to have a second home if I use solar energy there? Gavin, Bath A The second home is becoming an incredibly thorny social and environmental issue. As a second-home owner you may feel you actually contribute a lot through your extra house. In Appledore, in Devon, dubbed Britain's 'second home' capital, one in 10 homes is an extra residence; here, council tax for weekenders has increased from 50 per cent to 90 per cent, and other councils have followed suit. You could even argue that as a weekend visitor you bring extra economic benefits to the community, by providing custom. However, there's no denying that second homes price local people out of the housing market. They also exclude some key workers, such as school or hospital staff, who may be vital to the area. You don't say where your second home is, so it could be abroad. Last year, 50,000 Brits bought a home overseas. On average they will make six trips a year to visit these properties, fuelling the ever-expanding market for cheap flights. Such flights might seem cheap, but the negative impact of air travel on the environment is verging on the catastrophic - it is two to four times greater than any other form of transport. Where there are language and cultural barriers, you're increasingly unlikely to be active in your weekend community. In this case, the place in the sun is merely a means of escaping one community and swapping it for somebody else's, without really contributing to either, with or without solar panels. Q I want to replace my current car with a more environmentally sound model. What's the best option? Bethan, Swansea A I'm duty bound to suggest the bus, but I know that's not what you're after, so I'll nominate the G-Wiz. Small yet perfectly formed, this little car is just 2.6m long (that's smaller than a Smart car). According to the Energy Saving Trust it's also the most energy-efficient on the road. At £5,599 to buy (this includes a £1,000 government Power Swift grant) and £1.62 a day to run, it's the cheapest of eco cars. It's also exempt from road tax, and many parking spaces are free. Of course, there are downsides. The G-Wiz is charged from a normal electric socket (to be truly emissions free you must have a green, renewable tariff) and takes about two-and-a-half hours to charge up to 80 per cent capacity. The top speed is 40mph, but seeing as the average UK journey is just eight miles, that's not a handicap. Q Is it true that I can offset the impact of flying and heating my home by signing up to a carbon-neutral scheme? Tom, Leamington Spa A Basically, the idea is that you offset the greenhouse gases you create during normal life by financing a tree-planting project, or investing in renewable technologies. Celebrities have been signing up to carbon neutrality in their droves. In the case of high-profile fans such as Coldplay, the Rolling Stones and, er, Dido, they want to offset the emissions caused by touring, CD production and huge stadia concerts. In the UK, Future Forests (0870 199 9988) is the leader of carbon-neutral schemes. Founded by the late Joe Strummer, front man of the Clash, the website calculates how much pollution a trip has caused and tells you how many trees need to be planted to 'neutralise' the carbon emissions released into the atmosphere - one tree costs £8.50. Unfortunately, this all smacks of having your carbon cake and eating it. According to research, trees have a much more limited 'sink function' than first thought, ie they do not absorb as much carbon. Critics claim that for carbon neutrality to stand any chance, trees would need to cover the whole country and not just small areas of Scotland. Meanwhile, 'neutralising' fossil-fuel emissions can actually legitimise wasteful behaviours. Not emitting greenhouse gases in the first place is better than trying to soak up emissions afterwards. Q Instead of going on holiday this year, I'd like to raise money by participating in a sponsored trek or cycle ride somewhere remote. Is this a good idea? Andrew, Winchester A This still counts as a holiday. The expedition, sponsored or otherwise, is essentially a form of ecotourism; the fortnight in Spain has been superseded by missions to save orang-utans, trek across the Himalayas or canoe down the Zambezi. But what do these trips do for the remote area you're visiting? Tourism can change a region forever, and seldom for the better. The charity Survival International makes the point that Himalayan fields lie uncultivated because the men who once farmed them, and consequently provided food for the region, have become porters on climbing expeditions. Research is key. Before you sign up, you need to make sure the company you're going with has watertight ecological and social credentials. What is the likely impact of the trip on the local environment? Will the money you raise benefit that environment? If you can't guarantee any of this, then get sponsored to run a local marathon for the charity, followed by a fortnight on the Costa Del Sol recuperating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2004/jul/03/highereducation.news1","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2004-07-03T00:08:53Z","webTitle":"Review: The End of Oil by Paul Roberts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/03/highereducation.news1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2004/jul/03/highereducation.news1","fields":{"headline":"Time to cut down","bodyText":"The End of Oil by Paul Roberts 352pp, Bloomsbury, £17.99 The current world order is essentially about the geopolitics of oil, and this book is a tour de force in charting, in a highly readable, balanced and objective manner, a fluid, constantly changing dynamic. It is to be hoped that it will be widely read in the United States (the home country of the author), since Americans are the least energy-conscious people in the world, are profoundly ignorant of what energy is and continue to live in a state of denial. Paul Roberts describes the oil problem with exquisite clarity. Oil now provides 40% of the world energy market, although 26% still comes from coal and 24% from natural gas. By 2035 the world will use more than twice as much energy as it does today. Demand for oil will grow from today's 80m barrels a day to around 140m barrels. The use of natural gas, it is widely predicted, will expand even more, by some 120%, and coal by nearly 60%. These are staggering requirements: so where will all this extra hydrocarbon energy come from? For the past decade the world has used 24bn barrels of oil a year, but has found on average less than 10bn barrels of new oil annually. In other words, demand for oil is soaring, especially from the industrialisation of China and India, while new capacity and reserves are shrinking. Moreover, the political instability of the world energy market is also growing apace. By the end of the current decade, Opec will be supplying 40% of the world's oil, well up from 28% today. This background gives an interesting insight into the motives behind the Iraq war. Before the war, Iraq was producing 3.5m barrels a day, and many in the US administration believed this could be doubled by 2010. If Iraq could then be \"persuaded\" to ignore its Opec quota and produce at maximum capacity, the flood of new oil would end Opec's control over the oil price. Unlocking Opec oil, combined with being a decade ahead of the world in military technology, would guarantee American supremacy for a century or more. Control of oil would not only underpin American economic strength and power, but it would also be part of a much bigger geostrategic vision, offering leverage over countries more dependent on the Gulf for oil, especially China and Europe. Even though the US neocon vision has gone badly awry, Washington's response to the approaching world energy crisis - to secure, by force if necessary, the remaining sources of oil supply - will have lethal consequences for the planet. Global warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, primarily oil and coal, are increasing at 3% a year, and at this rate will reach 12bn tons a year by 2030 and over 20bn tons by the end of the century. On that basis, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will reach a concentration of 1,100 parts per million (three times the level of today), at which point even sceptical climate scientists concede that all hell will break loose. So is there an exit from the disaster to which we are heading? As Roberts points out, solar energy and wind power have huge potential, but are not yet ready for prime time. Together they currently provide less than half of 1% of the world energy total. And there are still enormous hurdles to overcome. The best solar-power cells have efficiencies of only 10%; the costs of manufacturing these silicon-based cells remain incredibly high; and the power generated is intermittent, depending on climatic conditions. The best alternative is one still too little talked about: conservation. The volume of energy we squander is prodigious. US power plants discard more energy in waste heat than Japan's entire energy requirement. Only 15% of the energy in a gallon of petrol ever reaches the wheels of a car, and less than a quarter of the energy used in a standard oven reaches the food. It has been calculated that a mere 2.7 miles-per-gallon improvement in the fuel economy of American cars and light vehicles would be enough to do without the need for oil imports from the Persian Gulf entirely - a rather better solution than launching a war on Iraq. Energy-efficiency gains could actually save more oil than could be found in the ground, and at lower cost than the average market price for oil. The implications of this are stunning. If we reduced energy intensity by just 3% a year, we could meet world demand in 2100 with only a quarter of the energy used today. The trouble is that the \"efficiency dividend\" has so often been misspent. The fuel economy of cars has improved dramatically over the past decade, but consumers have responded by buying more cars or bigger cars, including the absurdly misnamed sports utility vehicles. Today's lighting systems are dramatically more efficient, but any potential energy savings are offset by dozens more recessed or track lights. Other energy savings are spent on more air conditioning systems, big-screen home-entertainment TV centres and additional refrigerators. The lesson of all this is the perversity of minimising cost, which is the goal of technology, rather than maximising conservation. But it does open up a real prospect of a different energy future - not one based on carbon-free energy sources alone, which are coming on stream too slowly, but one that joins these technologies with huge gains in efficiency that could then power cars, houses and industry, requiring only half or a quarter of the energy. What are the chances of this becoming the driving force of a new global energy order? At the moment, next to nil. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were primarily about oil. The US is now building up a military presence in west Africa because it has known oil reserves of 66bn barrels - at least a 10th of those in the Middle East. Significantly, the US showed no interest in sending troops to oil-less Liberia. And US domestic investment in hydrocarbons continues to rise, with US coal consumption (and CO2 emissions) expected to increase by a further 25% by 2020, when nearly half of its power will come from the coal-fired sector - which, given the jobs and votes attached to that sector, goes a long way to explain US resistance to the Kyoto protocol. So will the market ever move? Roberts quotes some very revealing research from the University of California which measured the hidden \"well-to-wheels\" costs of the pollution each gallon of petrol accounts for - from when the oil is produced and refined to when it is burned in the engine, including air pollution, climate change and military expenditures to protect oil supplies. If these factors are considered in the price of a car or the price of petrol, as they should be, the hydrogen fuel cell car becomes about 25% cheaper than today's petrol-driven cars. Roberts's book ends with a vision of a \"bridge economy\", the transitional phase to a new energy order for the US. It will initially be fuelled by gas, much cleaner than oil or coal, so dramatically increasing the availability of gas should be a prime focus for the US. Second, a carbon penalty needs to be introduced, perhaps a cap and trade system, but including also developing coal gasification and carbon sequestration as the essence of clean coal. Third, a massive uplift in US car efficiency should be achieved by reintroducing the highly successful Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which Reagan abolished in 1987. Roberts adds here the interesting idea of a \"feebate\" - a stiff penalty (say $5,000) if a car is bought that does 20 miles per gallon or fewer, and the same amount as a reward if a car is bought that does 40 miles per gallon or more. This is an outstandingly clear, lucid and readable book about a highly complex issue that is central to our times. If I could recommend some books for George Bush and Tony Blair to read, this would be one of them. · Michael Meacher is Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2004/sep/11/2020.paulbrown1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2004-09-11T22:59:22Z","webTitle":"The balance of power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/11/2020.paulbrown1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2004/sep/11/2020.paulbrown1","fields":{"headline":"The balance of power","bodyText":"What will happen when the gas runs out, when the deepest oil well of the Arabian peninsula finally runs dry, when the giant drills of the offshore platforms reach nothing but dry rock? Will we face a future of blackouts and electricity rationing, or will we find a way to avert the doomiest scenarios and continue living lives in which energy consumption is crucial to everything we do. Think of the electricity you use in a day. You are woken by the clock radio buzzing into life, and you turn the bathroom light on as you climb into your power shower. After dressing you head downstairs, where you turn on another radio, put some bread into the toaster and turn on the kettle, getting the milk from your fridge to put in your tea. After breakfast you head to work, where the lights are burning - and on go the computer and desktop fan. Those are just the most obvious of personal uses and the day has barely even begun. How can we possibly sustain such a level of usage? In short: renewable energy sources. There is no longer any doubt that renewable energies will play a large part in the future of mankind. If politicians show sufficient will and intelligence, and invest in a raft of new technologies, then we should be able to maintain our electricity supply and, as a beneficial side-effect, avert the disaster of rapid global warming. But as with the debate about nuclear power in the 1980s, it will not be environmental arguments that win the day, but economics. Nuclear power lost out not because of the vexed question of radioactive waste but because the truth finally emerged that it was a very expensive way to keep the lights on. When oil and natural gas begin to run out - and, more importantly, when demand exceeds supply - their prices will escalate and the cost of using them to generate electricity will become prohibitive. Continuing to use coal or, worse, increasing the quantity we burn will be more and more unacceptable, because it will add to the excessive quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Those factors make both renewables and nuclear more and more competitive. The renewables revolution has begun already, because researchers are anticipating the moment when renewables become economic. Although there are a range of renewables already in use, the contribution to world energy production - hydropower aside - remains relatively minor, at less than 1%. But there is a large selection of new renewables under research and development. Hydropower is already one of the largest and most established forms of renewable energy, providing 19% of the world's electricity. Of the others, geothermal is a long established and growing energy resource, and wind power is already a mainstream technology. A variety of other smaller technologies are also already economic, the best of which involves using methane from landfill sites. Across the world a mixture of other fuels from specially grown trees, forest offcuts, pig slurry, straw and even chicken litter are generating power. And there are others that are, as yet, underexploited but with great potential: solar is growing fast, and tidal, ocean currents and wave power are also undergoing rapid development. Further ahead, though not before 2020, lots of other possibilities exist - the prospect of the hydrogen economy and completely clean energy production has led to much excited speculation. In Europe, money is being poured into wave and tidal power. Undersea turbines, working on much the same principle as wind turbines, are already in operation in the UK and Norway. Their potential is huge, particularly because all along the Atlantic coast with its large tides, and many inlets and islands, there are countless sites for exploiting the power of the sea. And unlike the winds, tides are completely predictable. Wave power has great potential in exactly the same areas, and although the technical difficulties already encountered in its development means it has been expensive, there are many companies confident they can make it work. There is a race among developed countries to become leaders in these new technologies because of their vast potential to create jobs and exports. Geothermal technology is increasing in regional importance, particularly in countries that do not have a wind, tidal or wave resource. This heat is as inexhaustible and renewable as solar energy and comes from hot rocks near the earth's surface. Water is pumped into the hot ground and used on its return to the surface to create electricity and for district heating. The main geothermal areas of this type are located in New Zealand, Japan, Indonesia, Philippines, the western coastal Americas, the central and eastern parts of the Mediterranean, Iceland, the Azores and eastern Africa. But while all that sounds very exciting, leading environmental groups and engineers to take on the challenges of developing energy technology, mainstream organisations such as the World Energy Council still see fossil fuels dominating the agenda in 2020. That is mainly because the worldwide demand for electricity is escalating so fast they cannot see renewables catching up with the demand. The council is first to admit it could be wrong. It all depends on how quickly the oil and gas begin to run out. And then there is the nuclear question. It is not only the renewable industry that sees opportunities in the coming energy crisis and in our fears about the devastating effects of global warming. The nuclear industry rightly claims it provides a reliable source of energy that does not produce the carbon dioxide that fossil fuels do. But nuclear power is still dogged by the old, familiar problems: it takes a long time to take a nuclear power station from the drawing board to production; nor has anyone yet come up with a satisfactory method of disposing of nuclear waste. Neither of those disadvantages are attached to the new renewables. Currently there are 444 nuclear reactors worldwide, producing 16% of the world's electricity. Some countries rely on nuclear power for most of their electricity. France is the top of the list, generating 75% of its electricity in nuclear power stations. But most of the countries that have a lot of reactors - particularly in North America and Europe, with Japan also on the list - have stopped building new ones or have curtailed their programmes. As a result the closure programme is exceeding the rate of new building. But that does not mean there will be no nuclear revival. The nuclear industry is looking to expand into the growing economies of Asia, particularly in China, South Korea and India. China has just ordered four new stations and may confirm another four before Christmas. There are said to be plans to build two a year but even that expansion would only account for a tiny part of the massive need for power in that vast and fast-growing economy. Even the fourfold increase in the rate of Chinese nuclear expansion which the industry hopes to see by 2020 would provide less than 20% of the country's power. Other solutions are needed. The nuclear industry's other hope for a big push is the United States, not only because it is the world's largest economy but also because it is the one most dependent on oil and gas, and the one that wastes most of both. The energy crisis, when it comes, is going to hit first, and worst, the US. It is from there that the political push to make the world change course may come. The current administration does not give the world many reasons to hope. President George Bush was the man who repudiated the Kyoto protocol, which was designed to reduce greenhouse gases. Kyoto was one of the drivers of the renewable revolution and the fact that it has stalled because of the objections of the US and indecision of Russia has slowed progress towards their greater use. Despite his links to the oil industry, Dick Cheney, the vice president, pushed hard at the start of Bush's four-year term for a revival of the nuclear dream. So far nothing has happened, partly because of continued public resistance in the US and partly because of the lack of private investment. But the main barrier still remains the large capital cost of building a new nuclear power station. If you forget the costs of the pollution caused by fossil fuels (which is what the US does in its energy planning) then new coal or gas stations are far cheaper. But part of America's charm is its diversity of view. In August, California announced a plan to subsidise solar power for one million homes by surcharging consumers about 15 pence a month. The state aims to rival Japan and Germany in being a world leader in solar power. This debate about whether nuclear power is a viable energy source for the future has also started to grip Europe. Despite the heat being generated in the debate, expansion does not seem a viable option, mainly because of public resistance. Instead, many of the countries of western Europe have invested heavily in wind power, particularly Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark and Germany. In the UK, where nuclear stations are closing on a regular basis as they reach the end of their lives, about 20% of electricity still comes from reactors. However, there would be serious obstacles to building a new station, as a minority demands. It is estimated it would be 2020 before a new station could be finished, even if planning began now. By that time wind power will be producing about 15% of the UK's power, replacing the lost nuclear production. The opponents of the nuclear option say the future lies in the new breed of renewables, the potential of which is only now being fully understood. Although there is still room for more hydropower, it is the new technologies that hold out most hope. The new generation of energy, then, is likely to lie with forces as old as the earth itself: the elemental powers of the wind, waves and sun. The very things that have shaped so much of our past will also, with the application of the human factor of technology, help shape our future. · Paul Brown is the Guardian's environment correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2004/jun/13/fairtrade.business","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2004-06-13T00:05:59Z","webTitle":"Back from Amin's abyss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/jun/13/fairtrade.business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2004/jun/13/fairtrade.business","fields":{"headline":"Back from Amin's abyss","bodyText":"In northern Uganda, the notorious Lord's Resistance Army's murderous rampage along the Sudanese border has involved the abduction of up to 20,000 children, many forced to become gun-toting soldiers. Last month Unicef described the crisis as 'one of the most serious humanitarian emergencies in the world', adding that 1.6 million people had been displaced by LRA-inspired mayhem. This is about the only thing that puts Uganda in the British news today. But there is an untold, and perhaps more significant, Ugandan story. It was Idi Amin's bloodthirsty tyranny that forced 35,000 Asians to flee Uganda for Britain in 1972 and made the country synonymous with atrocity. Matters failed to improve after Amin's dictatorship ended in 1979, but since 1986 Uganda has been on the long, slow road to recovery. Last year, its economy was the best-performing in Africa, with growth rates exceeding 5 per cent. Within weeks the state's biggest company flotation will seal the country's rehabilitation into the financial mainstream. A 40 per cent stake in DFCU, the country's fourth-largest bank, will be listed. It's a near certainty the float will be oversubscribed and raise £12 million. With the country stable - save for the north - some Asians are now returning to Uganda. Abhay Shah sold his home in Kent four years ago to live in Kampala. Today he runs Ultra Tec, supplying 'power solutions' to Uganda's telecom providers. 'I have personal satisfaction doing something I like in the industry I like as well as seeing a difference something like this can bring,' he says from his office in a leafy part of Kampala. One strand of Shah's enterprise says everything about business in Uganda. Mobile phone use is going through the roof in Africa. For farmers, the technology is vital because they can access up-to-the-minute world commodity prices on their handsets. Price information stops middlemen ripping them off. The trouble is that Ugandan energy provision is so poor that few people can charge mobile phones. Under 3 per cent of the population has access to power, one of the lowest connection rates in Africa. Businesses take power blackouts as a fact of life. Shah has devised a phone charger powered by a solar panel. It sells for $75, but average wages are about $300 a year, so his breakthrough is only available to farmers through some form of consumer finance facility, a rarity in Uganda these days. One farmer who could benefit from this technology might be Juma Musafiri, who owns 23 acres in Kayunga, where he grows pineapples, paw paws and mangoes. He takes us to see a waterfall close to the source of the Nile, a truly gorgeous place. What Musafiri wants to see here is a hydro-electric dam he says could transform not just his fortunes but those of the whole region. However, the prospects of this happening soon are remote because of difficulties with the country's flagship £342m Bujagali dam scheme. This should have been the answer to Uganda's prayers, supplying 250MW of power and at a stroke doubling energy provision. The project, on a tributary of the Nile, ought to be nearing completion, but has has been dogged by bribery and corruption scandals. Its main backer, AES of the United States, walked away last year, writing off $70m (£46m). New tenders for the work were submitted this month but the government has said it will be 2009 before completion. Meanwhile, the World Bank has a 10-year, $600m energy fund. But, two years in, a paltry amount of money has been drawn down, to the frustration of business leaders, bankers and government. Syda Bbumba, the country's minister for energy and mineral development, describes the World Bank as the 'biggest bureaucracy in the world'. Today, the burning of wood and charcoal accounts for 93 per cent of Uganda's energy provision. Commercial energy demand is growing at 8 per cent a year. The government's plan is to increase energy connection from 3 to 10 per cent in six years. It has deregulated the electricity sector, privatised some of it and is desperate for foreign investment to back new hydro projects. In September, the government will establish whether a recently discovered oil field in the country is exploitable. The signs are encouraging. In the past four years Uganda has had much of its overseas debt written off and last year its poverty reduction expenditure doubled. This has helped the government, led by president Yoweri Museveni, to fund free primary education. The Aids crisis, while affecting between 5 and 10 per cent of the 26 million population, is contained. Access to medicine is good and public awareness of the disease is high. Uganda's progress has been immense. But to reach the next level, it needs to improve its transport network, boost secondary education, improve business skills and deliver power to its people. Rather than the perennial African story of murder, corruption and disease, it feels as if Uganda is on the cusp of wealth creation and poverty alleviation based on an export drive to East African and European markets. The next few years will determine its fate. Can they be sure of Shell? It was hard not to raise eyebrows when the Shell Foundation invited me to check its projects in Uganda. Was this trip a blatant attempt to redress the PR balance after the media mauling the Anglo-Dutch combine has endured, particularly in recent months? Or was something more fundamental going on? Perhaps a quantum shift in the way business deals with society? Launched in 2000, with £250 million, the sheer size of Shell's foundation makes it at a stroke one of the most powerful charities in the world. It works by partnering local banks in developing countries. The banks identify small businesses desperate for investment to buy equipment, particularly businesses that are energy-related. Shell's model demands that bank loans - which range between $2,000 and $1m - are paid back. Businesses generally stump up 15 per cent of a loan to qualify. The oil giant believes this commitment means projects have a better chance of success. The approach, devised by foundation director Kurt Hoffman, is markedly different to the traditional aid model. In most cases, international aid amounts to 'free money', making business disciplines hard to foster. Once the money tap is turned off, many projects fail. Meanwhile, funding decisions by donors are generally made thousands of miles away. Not only does this slow the decision-making process but often the wrong businesses get money. Shell's $4m Uganda Energy Fund lays emphasis on enabling businesses to access energy. In Africa, this often means harnessing solar power. The continent, after all, should be a solar energy powerhouse. But past schemes have run into the ground because equipment has been poor and after-sales service to maintain equipment virtually non-existent. A recent report shows that a staggering £3 billion invested in solar projects by international organisations since 1980 has all but failed to improve energy access. In Uganda, Shell has part nered DFCU Leasing which, since 1995, has made loans to nearly 4,000 Ugandan businesses. In that time, its non-performing loan rate is just 4.5 per cent, with 1.7 per cent declared a loss. This is considered an excellent record. Businesses that have received loans include dried-fruit farmers, who bought solar panels that power ventilators which suck out moisture from covered drying tables. Uganda's leading honey firm, Beenatural, received money from the fund for a hybrid power generator that runs on both solar and fossil fuel. Within months, both these businesses could start exporting to lucrative European markets, giving the communities in which they are based a massive lift. 'Instead of just donating money, we're using local finance and sustainable business models to create engines of economic growth,' says Chris West, a former senior environment official at the Department for International Development, now Shell Foundation's deputy director. 'This goes beyond corporate social responsibility.' It's easy to view Shell's involvement cynically. Its Ugandan Energy Fund is looked on favourably by the state and this could bring the oil giant benefits. Recent discoveries mean that Shell, the largest business contributor to Ugandan revenue, would be an obvious port of call should the results of testing in three months prove the oil is plentiful and easily accessible. And what Shell is doing is a drop in the ocean.'But it's the small-scale projects which, if scaled up, could be a template for real economic growth in poor countries,' says West. Consumer financing mechanisms must also be introduced, principally through micro-finance lenders. This will be the next stage of the foundation's work. And other multinationals are poised to follow Shell by launching sizeable funds in poor countries. Hundreds of billions of dollars of traditional aid have failed to make a difference in Africa. Could harnessing of business methods succeed where all else has failed?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2004/jan/11/research.science","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2004-01-11T10:32:35Z","webTitle":"Giant space shield plan to save planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/jan/11/research.science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2004/jan/11/research.science","fields":{"headline":"Giant space shield plan to save planet","bodyText":"Humanity could not exist without it - yet in an extraordinary plan that underlines the catastrophic implications of climate change, scientists now want to curb the Sun's life-giving influence to save mankind from its biggest threat: global warming. Key talks involving the Government's most senior climate experts have produced proposals to site a massive shield on the edge of space that would deflect the Sun's rays and stabilise the climate. Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of metallic 'scatterers' would be ejected into the upper atmosphere under the plans. In addition, billions of tiny barrage balloons could serve as a secondary barrier to block rays from the Earth's nearest star. On land, giant reservoirs holding saline water could be built to offset the rise in sea levels caused by the melting of the polar ice-caps. The oceans, too, would be modified to cope with the planet's increasingly warmer weather. Massive floating cloud-making machines would be dotted across their surface while, below, large plantations of algae would be grown to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The theories were discussed by Britain's most eminent climatologists at a meeting in Cambridge last week to analyse the latest theories to tackle the problem of the planet heating up. They included the Government's chief scientist, Sir David King, who warned last week that climate change was the most severe problem facing civilisation. Professor John Schellnhuber, former chief environmental adviser to the German government and head of the UK's leading group of climate scientists at the Tyndall Centre, said: 'These are exotic ideas and we probably will have to come up with the right mixture. But the problem has not gone away, so we think this analysis is just in time. 'The present climate policy does not seem to be working. We are not saying we have the magic bullet, but this is a desperate situation and people should start thinking about the unconventional. Preventative plans on a larger scale are needed.' Environmentalists maintain that the solutions are so radical they serve only to underscore how unprepared governments are to deal with the threat. Last week researchers predicted that a quarter of land animals and plants will die out because of global warming over the next 50 years. Scientists, however, argue that until the United States and Russia ratify international agreements to limit the emission of greenhouse gases they will have little choice but to explore new methods to save the planet. Extreme technological fixes include deploying tens of billions of wafer-thin metal plates less than a centimetre wide into the Earth's low orbit via space rockets. These would be specially built to allow space-bound rays to pass while at the same time absorbing a significant amount of solar energy before bouncing it back into space. They would be designed to stay in place for a century. Similar solutions include the release of massive nets of ultra-fine metal mesh into the upper atmosphere by aircraft to prevent the Sun's rays from reaching Earth. Alternatively, millions of metallic-coated super-pressure balloons - similar in design to a children's party version, although a fraction of the size - would be filled with helium and released until they reach the stratosphere 35,000ft above the Earth. Trapped in parcels of air, they would stay up for about five years before falling to earth and being replaced. All the methods are designed to block about 1 per cent of the Sun's rays, enough to protect at least one million square kilometres of the Earth and significantly cool the planet. Inspiration came from studying the effects of volcanic eruptions in Indonesia in 1814. During these explosions, enough material was spewed into the upper atmosphere to cause temperatures to fall by up to 30 per cent for almost three years, roughly the amount some predict that they will rise to by the end of this century. Academics from California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who told government scientists about the billion-pound scheme, claim it will increase crop yields, because plants would be less damaged by the Sun's harmful rays. The scheme would create more spectacular sunrises and sunsets, deeper blue skies and would reduce the cancer risk for sunbathers and children. Pumping nutrients into the world's oceans remains another weapon under consideration. This would encourage the growth of vast underwater algae blooms to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Scientists believe 'large-scale ocean fertilisation' could act as a substitute for the world's disappearing forests, which act as a huge natural sponge for soaking up carbon dioxide from the air. Massive floating cloud-making machines could also become a feature of the oceans. These solar-powered contraptions would spray seawater droplets of a precise size into the sky to help encourage the formation of low-level clouds. Other ideas being looked at include the burial of carbon dioxide emissions underground. Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Roger Higman said: 'Climate change is the biggest environmental threat the world faces. It is important for scientists to explore imaginative ways to tackle its impacts, but technical fixes must not be used as an excuse for failing to reduce the growing levels of greenhouse gases.' This week the Government will announce how it proposes to implement the most significant piece of climate change legislation since the Kyoto protocol, Europe's greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2003/jun/26/ethicalmoney.ethicalliving3","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2003-06-26T14:59:16Z","webTitle":"How to dry your clothes in Beijing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/jun/26/ethicalmoney.ethicalliving3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2003/jun/26/ethicalmoney.ethicalliving3","fields":{"headline":"How to dry your clothes in Beijing","bodyText":"Dear Leo, I live in a city, Beijing, whose skyscape is normally something out of a Star Trek episode.

In China, washing machines are still pretty new, but now pretty standard. Dryers are still unheard of, although, as an American, I dearly miss them.

At the start of last month, the monetary policy committee seemed to be well ahead of the curve. The economy was recovering and, looking forward, the Bank could see all the available spare capacity used up before too long. Rates were nudged up, with the distinct impression given that they would be going up again regularly throughout 2004. The message for profligate borrowers was clear: cool it. The government's ill-timed switch to a new inflation target has muddied the waters. Instead of being above the old target, inflation is now below the new target. Indeed, if consumers really are holding retailers to ransom by refusing to buy until prices come down, it is just about plausible that inflation as measured by the consumer prices index could come down further over the next month or two, bringing it perilously close to the level - below 1% - where Mervyn King would have to write an explanatory letter to Gordon Brown. Against such a background, it will be nearly impossible for the Bank to act, even if it believes that the inflation figures give an implausible picture of what is actually going on in the economy. The MPC has built up a store of credibility in the past six and a half years, but even so it would struggle to convince the public that the time to raise rates is when inflation is so far below target that the gubernatorial fountain pen is being prepared for action. The only crumb of comfort is that since the new inflation measure seems to exclude those items rising most rapidly - that is, house prices and council tax - the public won't believe the figures anyway. Green hill far away Getting three buses powered by hydrogen on London's streets is a tiny move in the right direction, but there are still steep hills ahead before an exciting new energy source comes into its own. The first is economic. It is more expensive than traditional means by a factor of 10 on the fuel side alone, and a factor of between 10 and 100 on the technology side. Meanwhile the energy groups and car makers are steeped in the traditions as well as the economics of oil. They are dipping their toes in the water but at the same time researching more efficient yet traditional ways of burning fossil fuels and using diesel engines. On top of this are deep suspicions in the public mind that hydrogen is not safe. Residents of Havering who have campaigned not to have a BP-operated hydrogen refuelling station on their back door undoubtedly fear airships falling out of the sky. But the hydrogen prize is surely worth it. As London mayor Ken Livingstone pointed out yesterday, the new buses do not just reduce street pollution to zero, they also dramatically reduce noise. Fuel cells, which are like giant batteries, need hydrogen - and that in turn needs power for production. BP is using natural gas, a fossil fuel, to make the liquid hydrogen it plans to use in London, but completely renewable sources such as wind power and solar energy are being used in other countries. Britain could eventually follow suit. There are daily breakthroughs in fuel cell technology, with even the car companies talking about reaching commerciality by 2012 or 2014. And yet it is hard for them to put infrastructure in place before they know whether the government and public will want to power their cars with fuel cells in the future. In the 1950s, president Dwight Eisenhower put $25bn up front - $160bn today - to construct freeways across America, triggering the gasoline car revolution. A similar budget, still tiny by US military standards, put aside for hydrogen could herald an even grander revolution, one that saves the planet. Ofcom opportunity On the face of it, the report into the wholesale broadband access market is about as dull as regulatory pronouncements come. But appearances can be deceptive, and next year could see real change in broadband if Ofcom holds the course it charted yesterday. It is crucial for future innovation that other telecommunications companies should be able to get hold of BT's lines. At present, BT's wholesale broadband offering, used by almost all ISPs, offers just one speed. The only way in which ISPs such as Freeserve and AOL can differentiate themselves is by price. Other telecoms firms want to use BT's lines so they can offer ISPs the ability to launch broadband services at various speeds, or bundle in high bandwidth applications. The wholesale product needed for this, DataStream, has been available forover a year, but BT's rivals say its use is an administrative nightmare. Yesterday's ruling gave Ofcom the power to force it to play fair. There are two final pieces of the jigsaw. First, Ofcom must ensure the service is cheap enough to be viable for other firms. Second, it must clamp down on the one-off migration charges BT levies to switch users to the service. The market review was basically the work of Oftel, but these last issues will be dealt with early next year by Ofcom. It will show just how the super-regulator will deal with BT, and for the sake of competition, Ofcom should be tough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2003/aug/18/usa.guardianletters","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2003-08-18T00:59:09Z","webTitle":"Letters: Keeping the lights on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/18/usa.guardianletters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2003/aug/18/usa.guardianletters","fields":{"headline":"Keeping the lights on","bodyText":"For 25 years, the established energy suppliers have been arguing that renewable sources cannot be trusted because they are intermittent and unreliable. Now we have had the biggest electricity blackout in North American history (Huge power cut hits US, August 15) - thanks to fossil fuels and nuclear power, which normally supply the eastern seaboard. Things might have been better if they had invested in solar energy. A similar blackout is probable one day in Britain, possibly this winter, because our supply depends on the profit motive. It is more lucrative for the power companies to reduce reserves to a minimum, but when there is an unexpected surge in demand the spare capacity will not be available and the lights will go out. Under nationalised electricity, the grid was owned by the Central Electricity Generating Board, which had an obligation to maintain security of supply, and usually did so. The environmental wing of the Labour party, Sera (Socialist Environment and Resources Association) has called for the reintroduction of at least some state-owned power stations as insurance against the failure of the privatised sector, either from lack of capacity or from bankruptcy. After what has happened to New York, it seems no more than common sense. David Ross London davidtamara@rossd1.freeserve.co.uk If the power outages in the US and Canada turn out to be the result of grid failure, there is a lesson for the rest of the world. Just as North America can no longer afford to be complacent, neither can the rest of us: the green movement cannot be further indulged. It is the environmentalists' hostility to modernity that has put the American power grid into such a backward state. First, the upgrade of the Los Angeles electricity supply was stifled by their regulations and now apparently New York's. The same is happening in Australia and not just in electricity. Consider the water shortages that are coming to Australia's garden city, Melbourne, because the environmentalists will not permit construction of adequate future supply. Tom Minchin Melbourne, Australia tmenterprises@bigpond.com When I worked for Seeboard in the 70s, I attended an Electricity Council summer school. One of the lectures concerned the profitability of the industry. The speaker told us that we were spending too much on maintaining the reliability of the service. He said that we could greatly increase profitability if we aimed to restore lost supplies after four hours instead of after one hour as we were doing. From contacts still in the industry I know that this policy has accelerated since privatisation. Our electricity supplies could well be in danger of the sort of thing that has happened in America. David Burgess Hawkhurst, Kent As with 9/11, President Bush called the power blackout a \"wake-up call\". It's frightening to think what else he has been sleeping through. Rick Bryant Exeter Bryanrck@aol.com So, New York, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto have experienced no power, no water and disrupted transport systems in temperatures around 32C. Baghdad has been experiencing a similar disruption of essential services for almost six months, in temperatures in excess of 50C. What chance that the resources and urgency being put into repairing the US and Canadian power breakdown could be replicated in Iraq?

Summer can't last forever, though, and heating systems will soon be needed again. So, in the spirit of Energy Efficiency Week, which starts today, we've looked at options for heating your home that reduce fuel usage and benefit the environment. Solar energy Photovoltaic (PV) panels on your roof soak up sunlight and generate electricity. PV systems typically cost between £6,000 and £7,000 to install, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST), but because their use reduces CO2 emissions from conventionally produced electricity, the Government offers grants up to £4,250 or 50 per cent (whichever is lower) of the installation cost. And because sunlight is free, you will gradually, over several years, recoup your costs in lower fuel bills. For more details, call 0800 298 3978 or visit www.saveenergy.co.uk/eew. An alternative is to install a heat pump to run off a sys tem of pipes buried in your garden which collect energy from the ground and transfer it either to radiators or to an underfloor heating system. Ice Energy (01865 882202) estimates that this costs £5,500-£6,000 for an average three-bedroom property. That doesn't include installation, though, which could cost from £500 for surface installation to £5,000 if you have to dig bore holes. However, homeowners installing heat pumps can claim grants of £1,200 in England and up to £4,000 in Scotland - for more details, see www.clear-skies.org. Some electricity providers also offer cheaper tariffs to customers who use these sys tems. Npower, for example, charges just 5p per kilowatt hour (KWh) for electricity used by heat pumps, compared with up to 11.87p per KWh on its standard tariff. And as heat pumps consume only one unit of electricity for every four they put out, this means big fuel savings. The EST says the average UK household uses 3,300 KWh of electricity a year. A heat pump would reduce that to 825 KWh - which, on Npower's tariff, would mean an annual electricity bill of just £41.25. Underfloor and undertile heating You don't have to harness the sun's energy to heat your home, though - you can run undertile heating from a mains electricity supply, or use a warm-water system running through pipes connected to your existing central heating system. A full kit to fit out an average bathroom of three square metres costs just over £180 from Warmup (0845 345 2288), while materials to kit out an entire house are likely to cost from about £2,000, according to Penguin Europe (01737 761767). Neither company provides an installation service, though both stress that this is easy and reasonably quick to do yourself - Warmup estimates that the average bathroom installation takes just three hours, for example. Nu-Heat (01404 549770) offers a water-based system, which it supplies and installs. Expect to pay £15-£30 per square metre of house. As well as freeing rooms of radiators (which dictate where the furniture can go) and reducing allergies (because no carpets means less dust), underfloor heating also saves energy. 'The total effect on heating efficiency remains fairly contentious,' says Warmup's Jack Glendinning, 'but there is a consensus that it leads to energy savings of at least 10 or 15 per cent.' Sun roof Andrew Finnis, of Hougham near Dover, used a redundancy payout to finance his solar conversion. An electrical engineer with a lifelong interest in power production, Andrew was aware that some ways of generating electricity weren't fully exploited in the UK, so when his roof needed extensive repairs, he decided to strike a blow for green energy. 'I went for a PV system based on replacement slate - it fits together like slates but has integral solar cells,' he says. The system was installed last June. The energy output from Andrew's roof is much larger than a standard PV system and cost more than usual to install - the total cost was £28,000, of which the Government paid half. But since June grants have been capped at either £4,250 or 50 per cent of the installation cost. His system produces more than half of his electricity needs. 'More importantly, my roof prevents the production of a tonne of CO2 every year - that's worth more than the cost of installation.' Hot tips for saving energy Even without installing a new system, there is plenty you can do to improve your home's energy efficiency and make yearly savings: Insulate hot water tank: £20 Close curtains at night to prevent heat escape: £15 Fill gaps under skirting boards: £10 Use energy-efficient light bulbs: £10"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"science/2003/jul/04/sciencenews.spaceexploration","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2003-07-04T09:58:26Z","webTitle":"Analysis: Lonesome hunt by one pale blue dot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/04/sciencenews.spaceexploration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2003/jul/04/sciencenews.spaceexploration","fields":{"headline":"Lonesome hunt by one pale blue dot","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Monday July 7 2003 In the following report we said that Mars was always more distant from the Earth than Venus. In fact it is not. What we meant to say was that Venus at its closest comes closer to the earth than Mars ever does (but at times Mars is closer than Venus). ----------------- Are we alone? Very often that question is concerned directly with whether or not there is life elsewhere in the universe. But it can have another meaning, simpler perhaps: is the Earth alone? That is, might our planet be the only one in the cosmos to have the right conditions for the origin and evolution of complex life? This is the Goldilocks problem: what is required is a planet that is not too small, nor too large, or else it will have either an atmosphere that is too dense or none at all, like the moon. The planet must be not too hot, nor too cold. And it needs a magnetic field strong enough to shield out cosmic rays. And so on. The constraints are surprisingly strict. Look at Venus, virtually the Earth's twin in size and mass, and the closest planet to us (Mars is always more distant). The Venusian surface conditions far outstrip a hospital's sterilising autoclave in terms of pressure (90 times that on Earth) and temperature (500C). That's not to mention the clouds of sulphuric acid swirling around. Venus is just a bit closer to the sun than us. It absorbs less solar energy than Earth, because of those highly reflective clouds. But still it is too hot for life. Are we alone then? Is there, in the words of Carl Sagan, the late American astronomer, just one pale blue dot - a clement, water-covered planet - here in the Milky Way? Or are there many more of the same? In many branches of science, theory and experiment can work hand in hand. Theoreticians make predictions which can then be tested by observations of the real world. But in asking whether the Earth is alone we have little data to go on. We have had only one planetary system to study - our own. If we had a complete understanding of how the solar system formed, then we could generalise and make predictions about how many stars are accompanied by similar panoplies of planets. But we don't. Similarly, if we knew how life began on Earth, then we could make sensible evaluations of the chance of life having originated elsewhere, but again we have no such knowledge. What we are left with is feeling our way out into the galaxy, using our arrays of telescopes and sophisticated detectors. In 1995, the announcement was made of the first identification of a planet orbiting another star, the evidence being a wobble in the star's spectrum. Since then, dozens more like that have joined the databanks. What these planets have in common is a dissimilarity from the solar system. Finding a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting close to some star is great science. But it is disappointing from the perspective of a search for life since it means there can be no Earth-like planet close enough in to that star to maintain the right conditions for water to flow freely - the sine qua non of all terrestrial life. Finding a Jupiter-like planet a good distance from a star, mimicking our solar system, with every hope of big, rocky bodies closer in - virtually a Venus, maybe a Mars, expectantly an Earth - now that's big news for those who hope we are not alone. · Duncan Steel, a space scientist at the University of Salford, works with Nasa colleagues researching life's origins on Earth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2004/jan/08/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2004-01-08T02:51:37Z","webTitle":"Shortcuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/jan/08/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2004/jan/08/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"Shortcuts","bodyText":"A Mao for the mantelpiece Little would you think, as you navigate the £2,000 armchairs and coffee-table books on Scandinavian design (and Scandinavian-designed coffee tables to put under them), that the Conran Shop was a seething cauldron of communist sympathisers. Yet, for the past two months, porcelain figures depicting scenes of China's cultural revolution, along with busts and statues of Mao himself, have been proudly on sale in the chain's three London outlets. For between £14.50 and £32.50 - half-price while stocks last - you can amuse your friends with glorious images of a young Red Guard cheerfully menacing her teacher with a gun, or a peasant family coming together to beat a dunce-capped writer with a stick. It is true that tens of thousands of intellectuals and authority figures were murdered, and millions more were publicly humiliated, tortured, imprisoned and enslaved between 1966 and 1976. But the sheer kitsch, it seems, of a chic homeware store selling memorials to a brutal state purge of \"bourgeois influences\" proved too delicious for someone to resist. And the figures have sold well, apparently, if not quite well enough to keep them off the half-price table. The market for such questionable objets d'ironie should not take us by surprise, though. Nothing is more proletarian than taking offence, except perhaps drinking tea with your evening meal. And the more offensive the gewgaw, the more obviously it is meant as a joke. In theory, there is no upper limit to this principle, although a Waffen-SS duvet cover or an Ian Huntley teapot might be a step too far. It is interesting, however, that atrocities from 1970s China are already a laughing matter, while 1940s Europe remains tiresomely out of bounds. I telephone Conran HQ in search of an explanation. \"We are aware of the whole communism thing,\" says a beleaguered spokesperson, who has clearly had this conversation before. \"People have been letting us know.\" \"The figures were sourced in Shanghai,\" explains Liam Butler, Conran's marketing manager, \"and form part of our What's Up in China range, which explores the changes that China has gone through. We don't mean to condone or defame Mao, but merely to acknowledge his presence in China's history.\" A good thing, too, one might add, as Mao Tse-whatsisname is so little mentioned in Beijing nowadays. Must be why there's a giant picture of him on Tiananmen Gate, near his mausoleum. You know, to remind people of the communism thing. Does Conran have any plans to stock memorabilia to boost the flagging profile of, say, Adolf Hitler? \"Not really, no.\" Leo Benedictus Making the bog standard better The owners of a Derbyshire restaurant are thrilled to have taken one of the top prizes in a competition to find the country's most inviting and user-friendly loos. Judged the best of more than 800 toilets entered in the restaurant category for England in the 2003 Loo of the Year award, Tim and Tracey Bramhall of Bramhalls, in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, are \"absolutely delighted\" to have won their framed certificate. \"It is lovely to hear people coming out and saying how fabulous the loos are,\" says Tracey. Promoted since 1987 by the British Toilet Association, the accolade is \"Britain's favourite competition\", according to the awards director, Richard Chisnell. \"Because going to the loo is a basic necessity of life, it is relevant to every man, woman and child in the country. Next to eating and drinking, toileting is number three in the human survival stakes. If you don't go to the loo, you die. Accordingly, they should be in a proper state of repair.\" So what exactly, makes a good loo? \"First, you should be able to find it,\" explains Chisnell. \"Then it's a question of first impressions. What does it look like? What does it smell like? Are people having sex or taking drugs in there? Do they wash their hands properly after using the toilet? As an inspector, I will also check whether there are hooks on cubicle doors and enough tissue in the lockable dispensers. Indeed, that all fixtures and fittings such as the flushing systems are functional and that the area is clean.\" Bemoaning the fact that there is no government legislation on minimum standards of toilet provision, Chisnell believes that toilets would be a vote winner if only politicians woke up and smelled the potpourri. \"They like to be seen as promoting an inclusive society, but our loos are a joke,\" he says. \"I am constantly receiving complaints from people about the poor state of toilets in pubs, restaurants, you name it. The tourist board actually gets more complaints about loos than anything else. That is why we have as many as 18 categories of toilet inspection. \"None of which sounds particularly politically sexy, but things have to change.\" Patrick Weir Planet of the lie-in News for those of us who thought a sol was a bottle of beer with a wedge of lime in the top: sol is the technical term for a Martian day. Although the red planet has a tediously long year (687 days) and a distinctly complicated lunar calendar (two moons), a sol happens to be much the same as a day on earth. But not quite. The time elapsed from one sunrise to the next on Mars is 24 hours 39 minutes and 35 seconds. This really only starts to matter if you are an astronomer trying to keep tabs on your Mars rover. Relying on solar energy, Nasa's exploration vehicle can only function in daylight hours. At night, when the surface temperature plunges to a paralysing -12C (10F), little rover goes to bed - and Nasa's scientists with it. \"You get to sleep in 39 minutes later every day,\" says principal investigator Steve Squyres. It's not exactly a 25-hour day, but you would think that the extra time could be rather handy. The trouble comes, though, as Martian time and earth time shift ever more out of sync: it is like operating in different time zones with added creep. So Squyres's team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have moved right over to a sol schedule, depriving themselves of exposure to daylight and even wearing special wristwatches that lose 40 minutes a day. The astronomers are actually co-operating with sleep researchers to study the effects of altering the circadian rhythm - like Shattered, only interesting. \"My cats are staying with my husband, so they get to stay on Earth time,\" says Wendy Calvin, another mission scientist. Scientists at our own National Space Centre in Leicester have also been Martian clock-watching, during their efforts to get a response from the missing Beagle 2 craft. But no one has gone over to sols, according to the centre's space communications manager. \"They're just suffering exhaustion,\" says a depressed-sounding Kevin Yates. \"I am sure [teamleader] Colin Pillinger would go on to Martian time at the drop of a hat, if it meant he had a chance of finding Beagle,\" says Robin Catchpole, senior astronomer at the Royal Observatory. And would he ? \"Even my British patriotism doesn't extend that far.\" For Squyres, things get tricky when the second Nasa craft lands later this month on the far side of Mars - in a time zone 12 hours different. He expects \"a wicked case of Martian jet-lag\" trying to keep track of both. Still, every rover must have its day. Or sol. Matt Seaton The big read Exactly why the Cologne art and erotica publisher Benedikt Taschen wants his books to be bigger than any others on the market is a mystery known only to the Rhineland's most expensive therapists. This year's magnum opus from Taschen is a monster that can be gawped at in prototype at selected shops, in advance of its publication in the spring at £2,000 a go. It is a 792-page pictorial tribute to Muhammad Ali measuring a metre square and weighing 34 kilos, which aims to do justice to the man through sheer scale. Bibliophilia is usually pursued in antique bookshops and rare-books rooms, but Taschen has brought it on to the high street. The Ali book, called GOAT - Greatest Of All Time - has all the rarefied delights of Napoleon's early 19th-century Description of Egypt, which came in a series of mammoth volumes with foldout engravings several metres wide. Taschen, naturally, republished Description a few years ago. Each of the 10,000 copies of GOAT will be bound in pink leather by the official binders to the Vatican. Each copy will be autographed by Ali, and the artist Jeff Koons. Why, exactly, is Koons co-signing it? He didn't design the book but he was, apparently, around. And this is just one of the signs that perhaps the art publisher has gone a bit bonkers. If the definition of bibliophilia is that pleasure is taken in the form of the book rather than its content, GOAT is bibliomanic. It is a fetish object, and reading it is an act of excruciating self-consciousness (where would you read it? How? It would crush a coffee table). Taschen has long been a leading light in Cologne's madcap art scene (this is not a joke). But the artist who really seems to have started the publisher thinking big, costly and finely tooled was the saucy fashion photographer Helmut Newton. Scale has always been an infatuation of Newton's sexy pictures; when he published a book with Taschen it was so big it came with its own metal stand. This apparently didn't satisfy its publisher, but merely initiated a journey into the realms of bookish fantasy, as he wanted more and more, bigger and bigger. To come back to the analyst's question: but, Herr Taschen, why?

Dependence on the import of gas and oil from potentially unstable countries will make us increasingly vulnerable. But the fundamental issue is not energy supply, but addressing climate change. Britain's renewable energy resources, in conjunction with the emerging hydrogen economy and fuel cells, are capable of supplying all of the country's electrical, thermal and transport energy needs. What is needed is a progressive move towards this goal while making use of the existing non-renewable energy resources until they are no longer required. However, the regulatory regime is designed for centralised power generation. It does not promote the thousands of small-scale, clean generation systems. What we need is a regulatory regime which is \"transformational\", enabling the true value of green energy from distributed generation to be recognised, rather than throwing heat away at power stations. If we can confront the sophistry that big is beautiful, we do not need a new generation of polluting coal, gas or nuclear power stations. Distributed generation can transform a looming problem into an exciting opportunity and one which is cleaner, greener, more secure and, ultimately, cheaper. Nicky Gavron MLA Cabinet adviser on strategic planning, GLA · The Institute of Civil Engineers identifies the dependence of power stations on one fuel - gas - as a potential cause of blackout disasters. This looks rather like scaremongering - unless the solutions are also promoted. The first strategy to avert the risks of overdependence on gas from distant fields is to invest in the remaining gas in North Sea reserves. If the UK needs strategic gas reserves in case of political disruption to imports, then the available reserves appear ideal for the purpose. The second strategy is to negotiate long-term supply contracts with reliable suppliers such as Norway or Iceland. The third is for Ofgem to ensure emergency electricity supplies are available through interconnectors to our EU partners by investing in undersea transmission lines. The fourth is the encouragement of energy saving. The use of solar energy could lead to reductions in the burning of gas in power stations. Finally, there is the development of low-carbon power generation. Policies are largely in place to ensure that non-conventional power systems will be developed efficiently. This is not just a matter for the government; the engineering companies and professions face the challenges, too. Dr Terry Barker Chairman, Cambridge Econometrics · The lights may well go out through lack of fossil methane gas. However, we still have lots of coal with no need to ask anyone outside the UK if we can have access to it. The UK coal usage up to 1985 was roughly 100m tons a year, and that usage has declined since successive governments trashed the industry. The quantity of natural coal used may be up to 40m tons, depending on the price of gas and oil. Globally, the UK quantity is a flea-bite, since world usage is about 4,000m tons. We should be wary of committing to power shortages just to be able to say we have cut carbon dioxide emission levels by not using coal. Dr Alan Herod Imperial College, London · The ICE's claim that the lights are about to go out could have been written by the nuclear industry. Exactly the same arguments were made by bankrupt (but bailed out) British Energy. The detail of the ICE report makes its position clear: \"The public must accept that nuclear power will have to be a part of a truly sustainable solution. The nuclear option must be kept open.\" BE has demonstrated that nuclear power will always be uneconomic, needing hundreds of millions in subsidies and loans to stay afloat. Nor does it take a tree-hugger to realise that creating waste that is radioactive for thousands of years is not a \"secure\" energy policy. The UK has the best renewable energy resource in Europe, and even if we could afford nuclear power, we don't need it. Rob Gueterbock Greenpeace UK · It is impractical to meet more than a small fraction of our energy needs with solar, wind and wave energy. We need a programme of nuclear power station construction to bring us to a situation where we only use gas for electricity production at high peaks of demand or when weather conditions reduce the supply of \"alternative\" energy. Much of the opposition to nuclear energy is a spill-over from connections with nuclear weapons. Modern nuclear reactors are cheaper and more efficient than their predecessors. Steve Bolter Gestingthorpe, Essex · Power shortages by 2020, due to an over-reliance on gas imports, begs the question as to why the UK has never emulated most major European countries in the adoption of combined heat and power. One-third of central Paris is heated by household waste-fuelled CHP plants (and, yes, they manage to recycle too). Let's hear it for waste-fired CHP plants so that we can truly conserve the environment.

Findings reported in the journal Science show that while there may be plenty of water ice, there is not enough carbon dioxide to ever warm the planet enough to make the water drinkable. \"There's definitely not liquid water,\" said Shane Byrne, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology. \"There's just a three-kilometre thick ice sheet, like Greenland.\" Apparent indications of surface water, including features that look like river valleys, suggest Mars might once have been warm and wet enough to sustain liquid water, and therefore allow for the possibility of life as we know it on Earth. Astronomers have believed for decades that the Martian south pole had plenty of frozen carbon dioxide, unlike Mars's north pole, which appeared to have only a trace. New thermal images made by Nasa's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey probes show both poles have an abundance of water ice just metres below the surface. The robotic spacecraft sent back high-resolution pictures of flat-bottomed pits in the surface dry ice at the Martian poles, Mr Byrne said. These pits change seasonally, with the bottoms heating up in the Martian summer. That indicates the bottoms of the pits are made of water ice. The water ice would never warm up enough to melt, being dozens of degrees below freezing. Andrew Ingersoll, a Caltech professor and Mr Byrne's co-author for the Science article, said this scenario is bad news for the idea of terraforming, a visionary approach to heating up Mars enough to unlock its frozen water. A large amount of carbon dioxide in the Martian at mosphere is thought to be one way to have a \"greenhouse effect\" to capture solar energy to melt the ice. \"If you wanted to make Mars warm and wet again, you'd need carbon dioxide, but there isn't nearly enough if the polar caps are made of water,\" Prof Ingersoll said. \"Of course, terraforming Mars is wild stuff and is way in the future; but even then, there's the question of whether you'd have more than a tiny fraction of the carbon dioxide you'd need.\" · Reuters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2003/jan/08/environment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2003-01-08T02:10:30Z","webTitle":"Eco soundings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jan/08/environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2003/jan/08/environment","fields":{"headline":"Eco soundings","bodyText":"Explosive move Back in 1984, several thousand people in Bhopal, India, died after Union Carbide's giant chemical plant exploded. For many years the company resisted giving realistic compensation to the bereaved families or to the 150,000 people who suffer to this day. When Dow Chemicals bought Union Carbide recently there was optimism that, with $35bn of stated assets, it would assume responsibility and offer better compensation. Forget it. Dow, in what appears to be one of the most grotesque examples of corporate insensibility ever, is demanding $10,000 compensation from some survivors who demonstrated peacefully outside its gates for two hours in December.

It does not look good for civil engineering companies tempted to go to their governments' export credit agencies. In the wake of Ilisu, the French government has said it will not help finance the project, and lead contractor Spie, a French company wholly owned by British construction giant Amec, has withdrawn, along with Spanish and Belgian companies.

The electricity generator, part of Germany's E.ON, is targeting the social housing sector and claims the system will help government meet fuel poverty and greenhouse gas targets. Powergen wants to install a \"ground-source heat\" pump and a length of looped pipe which collect the solar energy stored naturally at a low temperature in the ground around a building. A mixture of water and antifreeze is pushed through the pipe while the pump helps bring it up to a useful temperature of 20C. The company claims the running cost of such a system is about £225 per annum com pared with a typical bill of £335 for a traditional gas condensing boiler. At the same time CO2 emissions would be 1,700kg a year using a ground-source heat pump compared with 3,400kg with the traditional boiler. \"This technology is a major step towards meeting the PIU [government's policy information unit] energy review's call for near-zero space heating buildings as well as making it easier and cheaper for the peo ple who can least afford it to heat their homes to a good standard,\" said Paul Golby, Powergen UK's chief executive.

Thanks to Jupiter, summer promises a mixture of hard-earnt glories and lucky breaks for which you may not have much to do but shrug and smile; June and July are your optimum months. If you are looking for a week in which to drop out of the rat race, try 4 May onwards. Happy returns. Aries 21 Mar-19 Apr: If you can be your own boss, rather than have a fight with the halfwit who's the official head honcho, you can prosper professionally now. As a patient, oh-so-reasonable Ram, you can be relied on not to lose your temper, even under provocation. Can't you? Reserve some of your current solar energy for your social and romantic life, which, with Moon-Jupiter action lighting your scope later this week, is looking peachy keen, if not the very picture of excessive behaviour. Taurus 20 Apr-20 May: Your sign is customarily described in terms of a steady plod, but the faster you gallop now, the better. Mercury, the great communicator, puts you at the hub of information, idle gossip and important news. Your ruler Venus, the great romantic, is on hand to sprinkle a little fairy dust on your social life. Another Taurean characteristic, conservatism, is also being stretched at present; 'out-the-box' thinking is favoured. Gemini 21 May-20 Jun: Give thanks for the camaraderie of friends and don't be reticent about calling in favours. Today and tomorrow are useful for insinuating yourself into the professional spotlight. It's a prime time, too, for getting your love life and working life hopelessly confused. While there doesn't seem much repose from work, your ruling planet, Mercury, has just gone into extended meditation mode - even you have to turn off sometimes. Cancer 21 Jun-22 Jul: If you have been swotting up on the secrets of leadership, now is a good moment to put them into action. With planets setting their face against yours, your personal presidency is likely to be as much about frowns as smiles for the next fortnight. On the other hand, your capacity to achieve professionally is also high. Tuesday to Thursday, as your Moon ruler waxes fruitfully through the Crab, is a prime moment to play politics. Leo 23 Jul-22 Aug: Great expectations? You may be sweating harder than usual now, but with a following wind gusting you towards your birthday, you can also reckon to achieve above average in the months ahead. This week is hot stuff for your profession, with talking yourself up a big part of the game (let's face it, Leos and modesty aren't made for each other). From Thursday evening until Sunday, a Leo Moon propels you into the limelight. Put on a good show. Virgo 23 Aug-22 Sep: Money, power, travel, romance - if you haven't yet collected the complete set, keep trying; the planets are on your side (even if your birthday is around 16 September). This week offers an engaging mixture of hard-nosed careerism (get dispassionate and mercenary) and big-hearted social action (get passionate and pushy). And Mercury throws in a side order of intellectual achievement - but you may have to break a few rules. Libra 23 Sep-23 Oct: The art of silence is one way to keep your personal life in good shape, especially since the home front seems noisier than a celebrity chef's kitchen. It's also become clear that if you want your working life to deliver the creative élan for which Librans pine, you'll have to try something new. Although this is a summer-long theme, there is no time like the present. Or the day after. Best have a think about it first, eh? Scorpio 24 Oct-21 Nov: If it's true that it's love rather than money that makes the world go round, you'll be able to laugh off any recent fiscal setbacks and run with the romantic spirit that is currently such a feature of your 'scope, along with troublesome but lovable kids (is there any other sort?). Professional breaks are back on the agenda, too; if your birthday is around Halloween, you're especially in luck: keep your nose to the wind on Friday. Sagittarius 22 Nov-21 Dec: Staying or going? Spring fever can leave you itching for a change of scenery, as this week's planets drag up long-running questions about your commitment to one or other major relationship. Even if you're all pledged up, your attention is wandering. If you're footloose, go right ahead and put the bight on your quarry. The weekend looks serendipitous enough for the lustiest Centaur. Capricorn 22 Dec-19 Jan: Good old reliable, predictable Capricorn, right? Not at present. The shearing, caustic energy symbolised by Mars in your sign means that old habits, old clothes and even old friends can be cast aside with scarcely a shrug. The one thing you can't throw overboard is your family, where diplomacy is currently called for. With Mercury on your side for the next nine weeks, you should be able to talk the birds from the trees. Aquarius 20 Jan-19 Feb: Put maximum value on your time and allocate your energies to definite, achievable aims. Recreation is at a premium for the next couple of weeks, and while fantasia has its appeals, and even rewards, for those born around 3 February, the rest of you have a pressing agenda (money, errands, siblings, family). The smoochy romantic stuff? Take your pleasures where you can find them (Friday is good). Pisces 20 Feb-20 Mar: The idea that Pisceans are all sugar, spice and selfless service is so much hokum. You too can play hardball when necessary. Given current planetary clashes, your capacity to morph from saint to shark might come in handy to secure your professional future this week. The 'independence or nothing' attitude applies less to your personal life, where Venus's presence means you should be able to bend all and sundry to your charms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2003/aug/31/hotels.travelfoodanddrink.foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2003-08-31T17:08:37Z","webTitle":"A perfect place to veg out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2003/aug/31/hotels.travelfoodanddrink.foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2003/aug/31/hotels.travelfoodanddrink.foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"A perfect place to veg out","bodyText":"For most people the world has shrunk to an extraordinary degree over the last decade thanks to the internet and cheap air travel. Yet for anyone with an unusual diet, such as vegetarians or vegans, the planet can still seem frustratingly limited. For the millions of us in that category, getting the right food while on holiday - or not being able to get it - is a key factor in the choice of destination. A couple of years ago I was really looking forward to visiting Cuba for the first time until some friends who had just come back raved about its many joys, but warned that I should prepare myself for two weeks of a rice and beans diet. Result: a short-notice cancellation and £250 charge. Rightly or wrongly, countries with a resolutely meat-based food culture are now off my travel menu. This may be myopic and self-defeating as I'd love to explore, for example, eastern Europe. But why pay to go hungry? Food can also be an incentive to go to certain places. India is fascinating - and the fact that often 90 per cent of menus are vegetarian, with meat dishes relegated to a brief footnote, only adds to its attraction. After the Havana no-go, Italy was the obvious fallback location where the local cuisine would be pleasure and not a pain. On countless trips overseas, most recently to Seville and Prague, I have sought out the nearest Italian ristorante and enjoyed choosing between a wide range of tasty veggie-friendly options, instead of having to settle yet again, with an 'of course that's not a problem' through gritted teeth, for yet another omelette and chips. So Italy's first gourmet vegetarian restaurant-hotel, Country House Montali, is almost holiday heaven for meat-refuseniks. Set in 25 acres on an Umbrian hilltop, it offers top quality cuisine in majes tic surroundings and is within easy reach of the many delights of Umbria and southern Tuscany. The only wild boar is in the adjoining forest, not on your plate. Montali is nothing like the tofu and lentils vegetarian eaterie of popular stereotype. As Alberto Mussachio, Montali's garrulous proprietor, says: 'Carnivores often think that vegetarian food is stodgy and weird, and that the person serving you will have dreadlocks, be smoking a joint and give you brown rice. But we have brought vegetarian cuisine to a gourmet level. Anyone who appreciates food will appreciate our food. You don't have to be philosophically a vegetarian to like it.' If that sounds like a boast from a proud, self-publicising host, the fact that 60 per cent of Montali's clientele are carnivores shows they're doing something right. Given the sheer quality, verve and imagination displayed by the four cooks, led by Alberto's Brazilian wife Malu, it's easy to see why so many non-vegetarians come. Even Buddy, the couple's nervous Irish setter, seems happy on a regime of gourmet vegetarian scraps, albeit supplemented with meat-flavoured dog biscuits. Ever started the day with a crepe containing pear, banana and honey, or a cold semolina with everything from dried grapes to coconut in it? I hadn't either. But at Montali, both tasted great. Cereal, a croissant or scrambled eggs is usually the best breakfast a travelling veggie can hope for. The kitchen staff have developed most of their own recipes, which blend interesting elements together in unusual but successful combinations. They avoid predictable Italian veggie staples such as spaghetti napoli or risotto ai funghi porcini. The most memorable of several dinners involved asparagus with a grapefruit sauce to start; timbale alla teramala (five layers of crespelle filled with zucchini, mushrooms, peas and three different kinds of cheese) as a second course; then aubergine tart with a parsley and caper sauce, cauliflower tempura and pepper coulis as the main dish; and to finish off, a tangy delizia al limone. Flavours come through strongly, but subtly. When food is this fantastico, the fact that it is a set menu is irrelevant. Dinner is an occasion. At 8pm everyone gathers for a communal drink outside then steps inside to eat together, but at their own tables. Alberto takes a huge amount of pride in the food, attending each table to explain the contents of each course as it arrives. He doesn't try to convert meat-eating guests to a life without carcasses but he is passionate to the point of evangelism about Montali's mission: to explode the myths surrounding vegetarian food and show it too can reach the level of technical excellence that earns Michelin stars. The opinion of two carnivorous American guests, John and Lori Maloney, suggests he's getting there. 'When Lori booked for us to come here I thought I'd be eating lots of rice and going hungry all the time. But if veggie food was like this normally, I'd be a convert,' said John, an insurance agent. 'I'd never have thought of putting asparagus and grapefruit together, but it worked', added Lori. 'We eat less meat than before for health reasons, and experiencing the wonderful food here makes me want to learn how to cook more like that.' Others said they had come for a healthy break, the implication being that veggie fare would help ensure some detoxification. A vegan with a gluten-free diet posed a real challenge for Malu and her colleagues but with some modifications she ate just as easily as everyone else. While food is the main reason to visit Montali, there is also the beautiful green and brown surrounding countryside, swimming pool, freedom to practise yoga in a studio, shady 75-minute walks to nearby Lake Trasimeno and complete peacefulness of the location. The absence of televisions in the stone-floored one-storey accommodation blocks, each with its own terrace on which to read or sip a glass of wine, adds to the tranquillity. You can make up your own mind whether a 70 per cent British clientele - our three million strong veggie population means we have more meat-avoiders than anywhere outside India - is a reason to go or not. Factfile A seven-night stay at Montali costs from £690 per person from 2 October to 15 October. The price rises to £775 from 18 September to 1 October and in the second half of October. The price includes half-board accommodation based on two people sharing, return flights from London Gatwick to Pisa and eight days' car hire with Simply Tuscany &amp; Umbria (020 8541 2206).

A meeting at Department of Trade and Industry headquarters will be told that the City still attaches significant political risk to \"green\" projects, despite Tony Blair giving it strong backing on Monday. Philip Wolfe, the chief executive of the Renewable Power Association who will be present at today's discussions, said the City accepted that the technology and commercial expertise was in place. \"But it is still sceptical about the level of political risk that exists, and this means they are still looking for 20% returns - way above the low teen figures expected on more traditional projects.\" The government must reduce that premium by spelling out solid targets for generating electricity by renewables beyond 2010, introducing more financial incentives and helping lower the cost of connections to the national grid. Jeremy Leggett, the chief executive of Solar Century and a member of the government's renewables advisory board, is equally vehement about the need for change. \"The absence of a firm target of 20% by 2020 and the pitiful sums of new money made available for renewables undermines the passionate rhetoric and obvious belief [expressed by the prime minister]. We could be a global leader but not if the [public] money continues to go elsewhere.\" Investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein points out that Britain and Ireland are failing to keep up already, installing 100MW of wind capacity last year compared with 3,247MW in Germany and 1,493MW in Spain. \"The City and ourselves are demanding higher returns on renewable projects in the UK because of uncertainty over the regulatory and incentives environment,\" said Marcus Storr, Dresdner's director of equity research. Over the next few years there is likely to be 300-400MW of capacity a year installed in Britain but government action would make this \"significantly higher\". Scottish Power, the biggest investor in wind power, said it welcomed the new push by ministers but also believed more needed to be done. Scottish Power has spent £30m on windfarm development over the last three years but thinks Britain will have to fork out a massive £500m to achieve the 2010 carbon emissions targets. \"The key challenge [for government] is to achieve greater priority for incentives to invest in new assets and align the regulatory framework with overall environmental and social aims,\" a spokesman said. The DTI played down the significance of today's discussions. \"The white paper has sparked a lot of interest, and this is one of the fairly routine meetings we are going to have,\" a department official said. The government white paper on Monday announced plans for spending of £348m but only committed Britain to \"aspire\" to reach the 20% renewable electricity target by 2020. The renewables industry has pointed out that the investment figure comprised £250m being spent on existing programmes and £38m in new funding from last year's spending review. The additional £60m announced in the white paper for research and development was very much at the low end of expectations. \"An extra £15m per annum over four years to be shared by all sustainable energy technologies hardly amounts to the 'massive step change in investment' called for by the secretary of state last October,\" said Mr Leggett. While wind power is still considered the industry leader in Britain, Mr Leggett says there is little sign of any real push for solar energy, which could play a major part. \"We still don't know whether the government is serious about a major solar programme from 2005 to rival those in Japan and Germany\" added Mr Leggett. Britain would reach 9MW by 2005, while Japan reached 400MW two years ago and Germany 200MW by the end of 2002, he said. The Japanese have been putting straight cash subsidies into their renewables sector while Germany uses rate-based incentives. This has led to Solar Century being forced to rely on equipment manufacturers in those two countries to meet demand in Britain for contracts such as installing solar panels at the national indoor athletic stadium. But lack of political will does not account for all the delay. Some in the City argue that countries like Germany have raced ahead with wind turbines because there is greater public acceptance of them. \"Britain unfortunately seems to be still a society peopled by too many who like the idea and then work hard to block planning permission in their own back yards,\" said one foreign banker working in London. While the renewables industry wants tougher targets, some voices are already preaching caution. The Royal Academy of Engineering says: \"Targets for emissions reductions and renewables, although theoretically feasible, will be very difficult and expensive.\" Information provider Platts believes the total bill to customers by 2010 could be £2bn, double government estimates. But the failure of public and political will on a much wider level has already caused difficulties for the small number of stock-listed equipment suppliers. Wind turbine manufacturers such as Vesta and NEG Micon in Denmark, Nordex in Germany and Gamesa in Spain have seen their share prices slashed by nearly 80% over the last two years. Their domestic markets are close to saturation and they were banking on new markets such as Britain developing to keep growth going.

Ministers have made it clear since Downing Street's performance and innovation unit report on energy policy last February that they were still in debate, not decision, mode over nuclear power. Although Brian Wilson, the energy minister with a nuclear plant in his constituency, is convinced, the public remains sceptical. This is partly due to a fear of accidents - a disquiet heightened by possible terrorist attacks - but mostly because radioactive waste is hard to store or dispose of. Nuclear plants are also expensive to build. Nuclear power does have advantages - it does not produce greenhouse gases. But nine of Britain's 10 nuclear power stations are due to shut down by 2025. Unless those plants are replaced by other low or no-carbon sources, Britain might fail to meet its climate-change obligations under the Kyoto treaty. Reducing Britain's reliance on nuclear power also might mean importing gas from politically unstable countries. But these issues are better addressed by speeding up investment in renewable sources, such as wind power and solar energy. They do not make the case for British Energy's preferred solution - another 10 nuclear power plants built over the next 20 years. The financial future of British Energy is important, as ministers will be held responsible for the safe clean-up of nuclear sites. But the solution to the company's short-term cash problems is not the one advocated by ministers - that of changing the regime governing the electricity market. The plight of one participant in a market should not determine its regulatory structure. Instead it may be better to exempt British Energy from the climate-change levy, as it does not produce greenhouse gases. This would net the company £200m a year. This boost to the bottom line should not end up in shareholders' pockets. Instead the revenues should be kept for cleaning up decommissioned reactors or for building new ones. The cash, of course, should remain untouched until ministers decide, possibly in the forthcoming energy white paper, whether Britain will rebuild or run down its nuclear base altogether."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2002/sep/22/ethicalmoney.observercashsection1","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2002-09-22T15:37:50Z","webTitle":"The lighter shade of green power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/sep/22/ethicalmoney.observercashsection1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2002/sep/22/ethicalmoney.observercashsection1","fields":{"headline":"The lighter shade of green power","bodyText":"It is widely touted as the energy source of the future. It's clean, does not produce greenhouse gases, and there is an endless supply of the raw material - light. Photovoltaic technology exploits the property of semi-conductor materials such as silicon to emit electricity when exposed to daylight. The technology has been around for some time, but use of PV panels in the UK is set to grow with the first grant support scheme for householders. The government will pay up to half the cost for homeowners, and up to 65% for some public buildings. One of the scheme's first beneficiaries is Trevor Nicholson, a 34-year-old lawyer. His house is one of a row of Victorian artisans' dwellings in Bethnal Green, east London. He opted for PV panels after considering the other main source of solar energy: black-painted panels which heat water pipes. Both generate electricity or hot water during the day when he will usually be out. But while surplus electricity can be sold to the national grid, subsidising the electricity he will have to buy in the evening and night from the grid, the hot water system would provide water for his house alone when he wouldn't need it. \"That's fine for households with children who need lots of baths,\" he says. But the only other member of Trevor's household is his dog, Oria. Another consideration is that PV panels are powered by light rather than heat, so they continue to generate electricity, albeit in smaller amounts, on dull days. Planning permission is required for PV panels, but this is relatively easy to obtain as many installations, including Trevor's, are not visible from the street. He lives in a conservation area, but had no problems. The scheme is administered by the Energy Saving Trust, and the application procedure includes assessment of the viability of individual proposals. Trevor has a south-facing roof, which is obviously advantageous. Because his roof is in two sections, he purchased a pair of panels. The cost and their installation and most of the additional equipment was £13,366, of which half has been met by the grant. Because the panels are heavy, extra joists had to be inserted. They generate DC power at 1,000 watts, which is converted to domestic AC. Further requirements were two new electricity meters (£180 each), to measure the electricity flowing to and from the national grid. Trevor's average consumption is around 3,000 kilowatts a year and the panels are likely to generate 1,600. In addition, the price he gets for the electricity he sells back to the grid will be fractionally more - about 1p per kilowatt - than he pays for his remaining supply. At first sight then, he should save slightly more than half his annual electricity bill. However, it will still take 50 years of electricity generation to cover the cost of the system. So does PV technology enhance the value of a property? Where it's a feature of new houses, vendors are adding its cost into purchase prices. However, this is not feasible for existing buildings; unless a purchaser is specifically looking for a home with a PV installation, the panels are unlikely to add value. Trevor is well aware of these considerations, but says. \"I didn't do it for financial reasons. Everyone has to do their bit to help the environment.\" More information Energy Saving Trust Grant inquiry line: 0800 298 3978 Solar Century 020 7803 0100 (email: enquires@solarcentury.co.uk)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"theguardian/2002/aug/27/guardianletters","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2002-08-27T01:12:59Z","webTitle":"Letters: On the home front","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/aug/27/guardianletters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2002/aug/27/guardianletters","fields":{"headline":"On the home front","bodyText":"It was good to see the logo for Agenda 21 (Earth Summit gets under way, August 20).

Didn't our Agenda 21 movement used to be the envy of Europe, if not the world?

Eric Hawkins Global Warming Solution Centre, Dorset jayhawk@lineone.net · John Prescott's scheme to build affordable housing at the Greenwich Millennium Village (Return of the prefab to house key workers, August 24) appears to be a wasted opportunity.

Compromises were reached overnight on climate change, trade and sanitation but an EU push for targets on increasing wind power and solar energy has met with opposition from the US and some developing nations. The US assistant secretary of state, John Turner, said Washington considered that an \"arbitrary target\" on renewable energy was less important than a cleaner use of all fuel. South Africa's environment minister, Valli Moosa, said the targets were a rich country's luxury. \"We will not support binding targets for renewable energies for developing countries,\" he said. The Kyoto protocol on climate change - which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions - received a boost today when the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien, confirmed he would submit the treaty to parliament for ratification before the end of the year. It is now left to Russia to decide whether it will ratify the agreement. If it does not the agreement may collapse as the US has already said it will not ratify it. The consensus on climate change to come out of Johannesburg was reached by saying countries that had signed Kyoto would \"strongly urge\" those that had not to ratify it in a \"timely manner\". Other deals include an agreement on trade that largely sticks to language agreed at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Dohar, but went further on phasing out agricultural subsidies by urging countries to reform subsidies that are environmentally harmful, such as those for the fishing industry. Earlier today negotiators added a commitment to halve the 2 billion people living without sanitation by 2015. The 10-day conference, which started a week ago, aims to agree on a plan to turn promises made at the 1992 Rio summit into reality. The UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, today urged all nations to work together to help the poor and to rescue the world's struggling environment. Conjuring up the \"cries for help of those 13 million souls\" in southern Africa facing starvation, Mr Annan told world leaders gathered for the final stage of the summit that failure to take decisive action would have a high cost. \"Let us not be deceived when we look at a clear blue sky into thinking that all is well. All is not well,\" he said. South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki said global leaders must not be afraid of a better but unknown future, as he opened the final phase, which will last until Wednesday. \"Surely there's no one among us who thinks that billions in the world should continue to be condemned to poverty, to underdevelopment and the denial of human dignity,\" he said. The prime minister, Tony Blair, said the world \"had a duty to heal the scar of Africa\" but the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, used his five minutes on stage to make a speech attacking the British leader. \"Blair, keep your England and let me keep my Zimbabwe,\" he said to delegates, triggering applause around the hall.

The audience of anti-war women who slow-handclapped him at the end of Tonight with Trevor McDonald was wickedly selected. It is one thing for a prime minister to meet opponents in robust studio debate. But this hurled him unprepared among desperate women whose personal tragedies meant nothing on Earth would change their minds about war. It is a sign of sudden loss of authority that a programme could ambush the prime minister with not one word of complaint issued from Downing Street afterwards. Alastair Campbell was there in the next room watching this hiding-to-nothing on a monitor and saying not a word. Now it is open season and the prime minister was harpooned - again. One woman was in the Bali bombing, her boyfriend blown to bits. One mother had three sons at the front in the Gulf. One woman's husband was a human shield at an Iraqi oil installation - would Blair promise not to bomb him? He writhed. An Iraqi victim of Saddam begged him not to attack her people. Worst of all, one mother lost her only child in the World Trade Centre and could not bear any other mother to suffer her agony. Their vehemence left him with a hunted air, his eyes flickering here and there, looking for escape. What's more, against all the rules of balance, Trevor McDonald himself weighed in with \"Aren't you just Bush's poodle?\" questions. It was unfair and impossible. The war arguments are finely balanced - moral cause claimed by both sides - yet Downing Street is on the back foot every day now.Platitudes are crashing all around them, old diplomatic certainties among the broken crockery. Everyone is flying blind and now the British prime minister is at the mercy of a swindling old arms-dealing poseur in the Elysée, and even worse, the power-crazed global bullies in the White House. Time was when Tony Blair could charm or at least mollify the most hostile audiences. But the old magic doesn't work any more, not on this life and death question. The more adamant he sounds on MTV and every other programme, the less he is believed. War leaders must sound adamant - but he never listened from the start. With no second resolution, ministers will resign, some from the cabinet. Clare Short was serially rubbished yesterday, yet she commands respect from some surprising Blairite quarters. Never a team player, she has no strong coterie but there are plenty of those who thought her timing right. If the puny doings of the British have any effect in the White House, then now is the time to speak out, \"at 10 minutes to midnight,\" strengthening Blair's arm to hold back White House impatience. As the cabinet's licensed conscience, she irritates other ministers but not because they disagree with her: on the contrary, it is because many of them want to speak out but must abide by cabinet omerta. If she is \"self-indulgent\", it is only because many of them wish they could indulge themselves likewise. Note how few said she was wrong - only wrong to speak to out. The trouble is, the louder the prime minister stresses his conviction, the more it paradoxically emphasises the weakness of his position. That crystal certainty is constantly undermined by daily reminders that his fate and the conduct of this crisis is not in his hands. What better example than yesterday's announcement that every single contract to reconstruct Iraq will go to US companies? It shocks Europe and the world to the core that Iraqi oil will pay US companies to repair the damage done by US bombs. With Halliburton's snout deep in the trough, vice-president Cheney holding millions of its shares in his blind trust, Britain was not even considered. Downing Street was left yesterday explaining lamely that when the bidding notices went out a month ago, only US companies had US defence department security clearances to qualify. Yet again, Blair is left alone to explain to the rest of the world the gross deformities of the Bush brand of capitalism. In this miasma of conviction, the prime minister ignores the damage done already, before a soldier's life is lost. The plunging stock markets, soaring oil price, vanished US tourists, decimation of pensions, destruction of the UN and the EU are prices too high to pay. Is it grubby to talk of money? The costs of the war are already astronomic: Britain could have built renewable wind and solar energy to make us green and self-sufficient for ever on the price it has cost us already. Add to that the spectre of smallpox or mustard gas attacks, the \"when, not if\" terrorist attack on London that might or might not have hit otherwise. Is it cowardly to be afraid? Or is it the better part of valour? Trying to argue all that away, the heavy lifting the prime minister has taken upon himself is more than one man can shoulder. His presidential style leaves others unable to share the burden: they sound like insincere clones if they try. The damage done to him is serious, and probably irrecoverable. Even if the war goes \"well\", there will be no forgiving his refusal to listen to his natural friends and allies. One sign that he drifts in fairy realms is his triumphalist insistence that when this is all over, he will embark on that even greater challenge - the euro referendum. It is as if he has not understood how his war strategy has left no Europe to join. Try framing a barn-storming campaign speech now on our great European destiny, a joint defence and foreign policy - and so on. The words die on the lips of even the stoutest Europhiles, cast into despair. There are too many things now for which he will not be forgiven by too many of his supporters: the war has leaked over into everything else. Forget leadership challenges, but when this is over Blair will be weaker. Will that be good or bad? His isolation and delusion could grow worse, stumbling into more errors, too full of his own conviction to hear good advice. Or he will listen as his ministers reassert themselves. He could devolve more to them. He could go with the grain of his own party and shed his Mandelsonian appetite for assaulting them at every opportunity. MPs and ministers will demand to be heard when this is over, they say in new stern tones. There will be no more acquiescence. This week's publication of the annual NHS figures passed with hardly a notice. Here it is, Labour's solid good progress, high spending at last yielding good rewards: heart deaths down by 14%, long waits down, more beds and 40,000 more nurses. But war blows everything away. The many costs of war put everything at risk. The prime minister will not be \"vindicated\" by dancing in Iraqi streets: even as a victor he will return not in triumph, but to a stony faced party. p.toynbee@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2002/oct/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview15","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-18T23:36:11Z","webTitle":"Letters: Oct 19","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview15","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/oct/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview15","fields":{"headline":"Letters","bodyText":"On the side of the angels In last week's review of Harold Bloom's book Genius (Book of the week, October 12), Frank Kermode mentions the Elohistic document in which God is called \"Elohim\", \"a plural form of the word for angels\". In the Hebrew Bible \"Elohim\" is used 2403 times: 2296 times the word is used as a name for God, 107 times it refers to gods. Nowhere can it mean angels, that is \"messengers\" (from angelos). The Hebrew for messenger is \"malak\". You'll have to count the number of uses of \"malak\" yourselves. Sarah Ensor London Identity crisis Hilary Mantel's essay (\"No Passport Required\", October 12) was depressing. First of all the interpretation she put on \"identity\" was narrow. We identify ourselves with a range of groups: family, occupation, football team, street and so on. Nation is important but in a continent that has had peace and increasing prosperity for two generations in an age of social and physical mobility it is no longer overwhelming. Second, the hankering for a European \"identity\" is confused. North Americans have established an overwhelming sense of identity across huge distances and from a motley collection of cultures. But US governments for two centuries have determinedly moulded inhabitants into a mono-cultural strait jacket - surely not the sort of thing Mantel has in mind. If a common European identity develops beyond the vague sense of shared arts, philosophy and culture, fine. But it's not something anyone can create except by Napoleonic methods. Dave Burnham Bolton High cost of hydrogen Larry Elliott is spot on to be highly wary of Jeremy Rifkin's latest \"New World\" prediction (\"H is for hot air\", October 12). However, Elliot missed the biggest reason why Rifkin is wrong about the future of the world's energy economy: hydrogen is an energy carrier/medium, not an energy source. That is, unlike oil, coal, natural gas, solar energy, or wind power, there are no reserves of \"free\" (ie chemically unbound) hydrogen anywhere on the planet. All of it is strongly chemically bound to other elements because hydrogen is the most reactive of all elements. Therefore, to move into Rifkin's glittering \"hydrogen era\" we would have to manufacture every molecule of hydrogen by cleaving it from an existing hydrogen-containing molecule, such as water. Far more energy would be required to make the free hydrogen than would ever be recovered in burning or fuel cell reactions. But the billion dollar question is where the initiating energy comes from? Rifkin simply doesn't say. Alex Avery Hudson Institute, USA Spoofs and Pepys Monica Hills (Letters, October 12) is surprised to learn from my book on Samuel Pepys that not a line of Elizabeth Pepys's writing has reached us, and reminds us that Dale Spender gave us her Diary of Elizabeth Pepys in 1991. She may like to know that in 1998 a second diary turned up, The Journal of Mrs Pepys , this time from Sara George. The British Library catalogue lists Sara George's book as \"fiction\", but curiously fails to do the same for Dale Spender's spoof, giving Elizabeth Pepys as author and Spender as editor. Perhaps this is why it has fooled other writers: Neil Hanson cites it as an authority in his 2001 book on the fire of London, quoting Elizabeth's supposed comments on \"the shitty hazards of the town... so much excrement each day does get produced and no ordered place to put it\". It is of course pure invention, but who knows? - perhaps a line or two by her may yet turn up. Claire Tomalin London Further to Monica Hill's letter, I attended a Workers' Educational Association course on Samuel Pepys and The Diary of Elizabeth Pepys was used as source material. However, although the book is written as if it was actually Elizabeth's diary it is a work of fiction by Dale Spender. Caroline Cook Grimsby Africa's agony Paul Theroux states that only Africans can make a difference in Africa (\"Epiphany under the sun\", October 5). Christian Aid has been aware of this for decades; hence our support for African community-based organisations. Malawi, like many other countries in southern Africa, is suffering from a combination of factors. Drought, floods, an HIV/AIDS epidemic and conditions imposed by international institutions have affected all these countries. The IMF advised Malawi to sell most of its grain reserves when it was on the verge of a major grain shortage. Government mismanagement has undoubtedly also played a role. It is simplistic to suggest, as Theroux does, that some governments in Africa depend on underdevelopment to survive.

The EU was under pressure from some governments, especially the US and Australia, to abandon its cherished aims of bringing sanitation and electricity to two billion of the world's poorest people, so as to accommodate the White House which objects to timetables and targets. Environment and development groups complained that some statements in the summit's plan of action were already weaker than the original Rio declaration 10 years ago, and wondered whether it would be better for the EU to walk away than to see the summit's aims further diluted. Margaret Beckett, Britain's environment secretary and head of its delegation, said that this was not an option. \"Of course we must ultimately have an agreement, but we cannot settle for an agreement at any price. My view is that we have to get on with it, and we stand ready to work day and night to resolve issues.\" To help speed up the process of agreement, civil servants were withdrawn, leaving ministers face to face. But it failed to help matters and the civil servants were recalled. One disputed target is the pledge to halt the loss of bio diversity, caused mainly by the destruction of rainforests. The G77 group of developing countries rejects the target because it affects their rights to exploit natural resources. There was also concern at the proposed 10-year plan to make industrial production and consumption patterns sustainable, because some fear it would hinder development. The EU was on weak ground, however, on agricultural subsidies. The developing world wants subsidies to farmers in both the US and EU abolished so that they can benefit from a free market. Doing so would stop the imports of cheap food which has been overproduced in rich countries and dumped on the developing world. Despite this, the EU is seen by most sectors, including that of business, as the champion of action. Businesses want an action plan so that many emerging technologies, such as the solar energy panels being developed by companies like BP and Shell, can be used to bring electricity to the millions of poor in Africa. Another key difference is that America wants to avoid any mention of climate change, still less of the Kyoto protocol on global warming, because President Bush has rejected it. The Russian deputy trade minister, Mukhamed Tsikanow, added to the gloom by suggesting that Moscow may not ratify the Kyoto pact because of the lack of \"economic interest\" after the US rejection. Observers interpreted his remarks as a bid to extract more EU money, saying that Russia's President Vladimir Putin had pledged to sign the protocol, and it was unlikely that a deputy minister would be allowed to casually overturn that pledge. Dr Paul Jefferiss, policy director of the wildlife charity RSPB who was a member of the UK delegation to the summit's preparatory meeting in Bali, said: \"There is great pressure on the EU to capitulate and agree a weak text. It would be a disaster for the poor and for the planet if that happened. It would also be a huge embarrassment for the EU after it pressed so hard for meaningful targets and timetables.\" Dinah Nichols, the chief civil servant negotiator for the UK, said that the EU did not intend to give ground: \"This summit must make a difference, otherwise what is the point of it.\" But if a deal is to be reached time is running out. The heads of state, including Tony Blair, arrive on Monday to make speeches and finalise an as yet unpublished political declaration which is meant to complement the plan of action. If there is no agreed plan, or it is so weak that it is being denounced by hundreds of environment and development groups, it will be a seen as an embarrassment. Mr Bush, who in his absence has been blamed for the impasse, is sending his secretary of state, Colin Powell. It may be that having worn down the EU's ambitions as far as possible, Mr Powell will make last-minute concessions on key issues to save the summit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2001/jul/26/highereducation.research","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2001-07-26T13:32:12Z","webTitle":"Lady Archer lectures reporters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jul/26/highereducation.research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2001/jul/26/highereducation.research","fields":{"headline":"Lady Archer lectures reporters","bodyText":"The small academic community dedicated to sourcing renewable energy came under the spotlight today, as Professor Mary Archer gave an impromptu lecture to reporters gathered outside Strathclyde University. Speaking publicly for the first time since Lord Archer was jailed for four years for perjury and perverting the course of justice, Lady Archer spurned requests to discuss her husband, but launched into a full explanation of quantum solar energy conversion, the subject of a summer school she is chairing this week. Archer explained that solar energy is a major renewable energy resource, and techniques for harnessing the sun's heat date back to the 19th century. Artificial methods for harnessing the sun's light and converting it to electrical power or chemical fuels are relatively new. But photosynthesis, the development of green plants in sunlight, is an example of this process working in nature. Archer, a leading light in the field, is chairing the summer school on behalf of the European Society for Quantum Solar Energy Conversion. The summer school is held each year in a different, major European university that has a strong academic record in chemistry. The academics teach an advanced course in the specialism of solar energy conversion to a small group of postgraduate and post doctoral students. An association was first established by an international group of about 50 scientists in 1986, following a conference on the subject. A workshop has been held every year since. The society was founded at the 10th International Conference on Photochemical Storage of Solar Energy in 1994. Archer is a fellow of Newnham College, a senior academic fellow at Leicester's De Montfort University and a visiting professor at the centre for energy policy at Imperial College, London. She has edited a four-book series on solar energy photoconversion, the first volume of which was published in June. She serves on the Department of Trade and Industry's energy advisory group and a committee to promote science.

The disclosure, in a briefing with analysts, pleased environmentalists and underlined the emphasis being given to \"green\" energy by big oil. Karen de Segundo, chief executive of Shell Renewables, said it aimed to increase its solar business by 25% a year, in line with the market. She admitted that a commitment to spend between $500m and $1bn by 2006 was subject to \"ongoing economic review\" and the figures are dwarfed by its expenditure on oil and gas. The Anglo-Dutch group recently invested in a joint venture with the German engineering group Siemens which is working on driving down the costs of solar services. Shell said it aimed to create \"a platform for growth\" in the wind power sector and obtain double-digit returns. The group is one of those chosen to develop 18 wind farms off the coast of Britain and is active in the Netherlands, Morocco and the US. Shell declined to quantify the scale of the investment in renewables but admitted it was very small in overall group terms. The spokeswoman said she could give no figures on current sales in this sector. Financial analysts remained unmoved by the London presentation, which is to be repeated today in New York. One, who asked not to be named, said: \"This put some flesh on some of the renewables bones but it does nothing to change our financial targets for Shell.\" Green campaigners at Friends of the Earth were more upbeat, describing the investment aims as encouraging. An FoE spokesman said: \"It is good to see European oil companies following the political trends towards alternative fuels. We think it is inevitable that Shell and all the big oil companies will eventually shift capital spending away from oil and gas towards renewables.\" Next week the the UK Offshore Operators Association (Ukooa) will hold a meeting in Great Yarmouth, a centre for southern North Sea operations. Ukooa will tell small and medium-sized supply companies that they should be transferring their oil expertise into emerging markets such as renewable energy and environmental services. More than 100 representatives turned up to a similar meeting in Aberdeen last month to hear a message of change that has the strong support of government. Demand for wind and solar power is growing fast and the pace is expected to quicken as hydrocarbon fuels begin to decline. Western countries also see renewable energy as a way of reducing dependence on foreign oil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2001/jul/26/politicalnews.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2001-07-26T15:42:30Z","webTitle":"Lady Archer explains all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jul/26/politicalnews.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2001/jul/26/politicalnews.uk","fields":{"headline":"Lady Archer explains all","bodyText":"The small academic community dedicated to sourcing renewable energy came under the spotlight today, as Professor Mary Archer gave an impromptu lecture to reporters gathered outside Strathclyde University. Speaking publicly for the first time since Lord Archer was jailed for four years for perjury and perverting the course of justice, Lady Archer spurned requests to discuss her husband, but launched into a full explanation of quantum solar energy conversion, the subject of a summer school she is chairing this week. Archer, a leading light in the field, is chairing the summer school on behalf of the European Society for Quantum Solar Energy Conversion. The summer school is held each year in a different, major European university that has a strong academic record in chemistry. The academics teach an advanced course in the specialism of solar energy conversion to a small group of postgraduate and post doctoral students. An association was first established by an international group of about 50 scientists in 1986, following a conference on the subject. A workshop has been held every year since. The society was founded at the 10th International Conference on Photochemical Storage of Solar Energy in 1994. Archer is a fellow of Newnham College, a senior academic fellow at Leicester's De Montfort University and a visiting professor at the centre for energy policy at Imperial College, London. She has edited a four-book series on solar energy photoconversion, the first volume of which was published in June. She serves on the Department of Trade and Industry's energy advisory group and a committee to promote science. Archer is understood to have indicated to a number of newspapers that she would consider giving an interview about her 35-year marriage to her disgraced husband for around £250,000.

This time of year is usually accompanied by a rash of articles and news stories warning us of the perils of the sun's rays, and drawing our attention to the dangers of sunburn and its link with skin cancer. Yet for all this advice to stay out of the sun, it appears we are reluctant to take heed: there seems to be no shortage of people keen to dose up with solar energy, and a recent poll found that three-quarters of us prefer the bronzed look over a more pallid appearance any day. For diehard tan-seekers, it makes sense to do what we can to protect ourselves from the ravages of the sun. Slathering ourselves with sunscreen and seeking solace in the shade when the sun is at its hottest are sensible tactics, but they are only half the story. Odd though it may seem, science suggests that our ability to tan safely is, to a degree, dependent on what we eat: there is good evidence that upping our intake of specific nutrients can help us in our quest to acquire a healthy golden tan. The undesirable effects of sunlight on the skin are believed to be triggered by the production of damaging, destructive biochemical entities known as free radicals. The fires that free radicals start in the body are extinguished by substances called antioxidants, many of which are available in food. Stoking up on antioxidants has the potential to reduce the risk of sunburn, and is believed to help combat longer-term problems, such as ageing changes and skin cancer, too. One antioxidant that is believed to play a particular role in skin protection is betacarotene. Carrots, spinach, apricots, cantaloupe melons and mangoes are all rich in this. However, additional supplementation with betacarotene may prove a convenient and economical way of getting maximum protection from this nutrient. My advice would be to take 30mg each day during the summer. Other antioxidant nutrients worth dosing up on include vitamins C and E. In one study, 2,000g of vitamin C and 1,000IU of vitamin E taken each day appeared to protect the skin from sunburn. Other nutrients can help the skin by assisting in the production of melanin - the pigment that darkens the skin during tanning and acts as a natural sunscreen. Melanin is made from an amino acid known as L-tyrosine, and taking 1,000-1,500mg of this each day as a supplement can help the body tan quite naturally. The conversion of L-tyrosine into melanin is helped by certain nutrients, notably vitamin C, vitamin B6 and copper. In my experience, taking 2,000mg of vitamin C, 50mg of vitamin B6 and 4mg of copper each day does seem to speed tanning while at the same time reducing the risk of sunburn. Nutrition news Fruit and vegetables are often lauded for their ability to help keep circulatory diseases such as heart disease and stroke at bay. Indeed, such foods contain a range of nutrients that may help maintain a healthy circulation, including vitamin C, folic acid and potassium. But do the theoretical benefits of eating fruit and veg translate into real benefits? In a recent study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , more than 9,000 people were interviewed about their dietary habits, and then watched for an average of 19 years. Individuals who claimed to eat at least three servings of fruit and/or veg a day at the start of the study were found to be 42 per cent less likely to die from stroke compared to those consuming no more than one serving a day. Risk of dying from heart disease was down by 24 per cent, too. Dear John I am 64 and suffer from angina, for which I take medication. I am still prone to attacks. I eat a healthy low-fat diet and take moderate exercise. Do you have any advice for me? Peter Ravenscroft, Salisbury Angina is a term used to describe the pain that can be felt when the heart muscle is starved of oxygen. It is usually caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries - the vessels that supply blood to the heart tissue - which may be the result of atherosclerosis (clogging due to fatty deposits) and/or spasm in the artery wall. One of the most important nutrients for controlling angina is magnesium. This helps slow atherosclerosis, and may also reduce the risk of spasm in the coronary arteries by relaxing the muscle in the wall of these vessels. Take 500-750mg of magnesium per day. Another natural substance, L-carnitine, helps in the transfer of fuel into miniature powerhouses in the heart cells, improving heart-muscle function. A study showed significant benefit in angina sufferers who took 1g of L-carnitine twice a day. Finally, the vitamin-like substance Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) helps generate energy in the heart-muscle cells. Take 100-150mg of CoQ10 per day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/1999/dec/28/timradford","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-28T00:49:29Z","webTitle":"'Direct beam' boosts solar energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/28/timradford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/dec/28/timradford","fields":{"headline":"'Direct beam' boosts solar energy","bodyText":"American scientists have built on the dream of clean, cheap solar energy, by taking sunlight directly inside buildings. The power source, devised at Oak Ridge national laboratory in Tennessee, offers the ultimate saving. Instead of using standard photovoltaics, converting sunlight to electricity and then burning electricity to create light, the method cuts out the \"middleman\". Optical fibres run the sunlight directly from the roof in to the building, producing light and power. Photovoltaics, which rely on silicon-based materials embedded in tiles that convert sunlight directly into electricity even on cloudy days, have offered huge promise of pollutionless power as techniques have improved. But the costs are high and the efficiency of conversion to electricity is still quite low. The cells of photovoltaics operate best converting infrared light, so Jeff Muhs and colleagues at Oak Ridge used a rooftop converter to split the infrared from the visible part of the light spectrum. They passed the infrared light to cells to make an electric current, and then used fibre optic wires to feed the sunlight into the building. \"By using the visible portion of the light spectrum, we can [cut] the amount of electricity for lighting commercial buildings and use other parts of the spectrum to generate electricity,\" said Dr Muhs. The technique could give a threefold boost in the efficiency of photovoltaics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2002/jul/03/environment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2002-07-03T01:13:47Z","webTitle":"Eco soundings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/jul/03/environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2002/jul/03/environment","fields":{"headline":"Eco soundings","bodyText":"Uneasy peace Monsanto has had some famous dust-ups with Greenpeace and the British media over the years, but peace is the new order. The GM company tells Eco Soundings it was more than happy with the latest BBC documentary under the Bitter Harvest banner, which looked at the UK conflict between environment groups and biotech companies. \"It broke the BBC mould; it was incredibly balanced and fair to science and industry,\" raves Tony Coombes, the company's spokesman. So hats off to producer Catherine Quarby, who, by remarkable coincidence, is the partner of Stephen Tindale, the head of Greenpeace. So what did Tindale think? \"I'm very proud of her,\" he says. \"We had a lot of discussions about the issues but nothing about what went into the programme. That would have been improper.\" Courting publicity You have to hand it to the Brits. When confronted with a settlement of struggling slum dwellers in the middle of a fancy flower show, they barely bat an eye. \"Very authentic, the atmosphere is very realistic,\" said one woman passing through Christian Aid's Brazilian favela, or slum, at the Hampton Court flower show. The charity's idea is to show the 180,000 expected visitors how the poor and landless are fighting globalisation, invading unused land and using native plants and crops to improve a hard life. While the middle classes welcomed the exhibit, the political and social points were rather lost on some of the people drooling over the Mercedes-Benz cars in the adjacent garden. Split personality Eco Soundings worries for energy minister Brian Wilson, who is supposed to be the most hardline pro-nuclear minister in government but who spends most of his time at the Department of Trade and Industry and whizzing round the UK opening straw-burning power stations, extolling the virtues of gas from dung, announcing grants for solar energy, and talking up wave and wind power. Most recently, Wilson's civil servants have pushed him to demand that the City starts investing in renewables to match government spending. Could he have seen the light? Or is there a DTI plot to madden him? Missing millions Meanwhile in Manila, leading pro-GM activist Professor CS Prakash, of Tuskegee University, Alabama, who runs the recommended, if marvellously one-sided, website called Agbioview, is quoted in the Philippine Star suggesting that Greenpeace Europe is spending $170m a year opposing GM foods and gets its budget \"maybe [from] some companies that think their business operations will be greatly affected by widespread use of GM crops in the world\". What could he mean? Professor Prakash, just named \"man of the year\" by Progressive Farmer magazine, is sadly unavailable to elaborate - and Greenpeace says it would be lucky to spend £250,000 on its campaign. Come all ye Tomorrow being the 226th anniversary of the US declaration of independence, a note has been delivered to Eco Soundings. \"The most heinous and impudent revolt of Her Britannic Majefty's American colonies is to be quelled at last.

So what did the security forces do? They fired off a banger to scare it, upon which the bear fell out of the tree and then was shot dead.

Within a year, the plant is expected to be sucking in just over 35,000 cubic metres of seawater each day to produce 5,400 cubic metres of fresh water for the local community. But India is not the only country now developing nuclear desalination facilities. Faced with water shortages, growing populations and global warming, countries from the US to Indonesia are looking to nuclear energy to tap the potential fresh water locked in the oceans that sparkle along their arid coastlines. South Korea has designed a 330-megawatt reactor for desalination and electricity. Canada and Russia are pooling their expertise to build floating nuclear desalination units, which can be moved around the world's oceans on barges. In the US, scientists at the Argonn National Laboratory have renewed their interest in using nuclear energy to power 500 desalination plants. Tunisia is talking to France, and Morocco to China, about nuclear desalination plants to supply the local populations along the north African coastlines with fresh water and electricity. Nuclear desalination is, however, nothing new. For more than 20 years, Japan has been successfully operating nuclear desalination facilities in remote coastline areas. There are currently more than 1,500 desalination plants operating around the world. But the problem is that almost all of them use traditional fossil fuels, which release the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. Toshio Konishi, from the nuclear technology and developmental section of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), the global nuclear watchdog, says the main advantage of using nuclear energy to extract fresh water from the sea is that nuclear plants produce far less carbon dioxide. The US energy department estimates that coal-fired power plants produce 964 tonnes of carbon dioxide for every gigawatt hour of electricty, while nuclear plants produce only 7.8 tonnes. But in spite of nuclear's relatively clean bill of health in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, Konishi warns that most developing countries do not have the regulatory and legal infrastructure needed to construct and operate nuclear power plants safely. Furthermore, radioactive waste from nuclear plants comes with its own environmental and economic problems. The world water crisis - which is already biting hard and is expected to leave billions of people without adequate water and sanitation within 20 years - will inevitably hit hardest in developing countries, which are the least able to afford the high capital costs of building a nuclear plant. \"Financing is a big, if not the biggest, issue for such countries to make a decision on deploying nuclear desalination programmes,\" says JoAnne Ford, an IAEA spokeswoman. But she maintains that the small and medium-sized reactors (SMR) currently being developed need less investment, shorter lead and construction times, and could therefore be more attractive to developing countries. Nonetheless, water produced by nuclear desalination can also be expensive. Even though a cubic metre of water can be produced for as little as a few cents, bottling it and transporting it from nuclear plants along the coast to cities can push up the price of a litre to over 20 cents. Pumping water through pipelines to irrigate agricultural inland areas is also prohibitively expensive and technically difficult. Environmental groups argue that renewable energy is the only way forward. Saudi Arabia has led the way by developing desalination plants using solar energy. In spite of the new interest in nuclear desalination, most experts agree that simultaneous action on a number of fronts will be needed to tackle world water shortages, especially in the developing countries, including the better management and conservation of existing water resources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2001/jul/27/highereducation.research","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2001-07-27T08:51:11Z","webTitle":"Comment: Dr Archer makes a quantum leap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jul/27/highereducation.research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2001/jul/27/highereducation.research","fields":{"headline":"Dr Archer makes a quantum leap","bodyText":"It became clear that the chairwoman of the Scottish summer school on quantum solar energy conversion was going to be more of a hit than any of her illustrious predecessors when the photographers started barging for position. \"This way love, that's right, round here\" is not the standard method used to address quantum theorists. The Arabic scientist certainly appeared confused. \"Excuse me, can you tell me what all this is about?\" he asked as the chairwoman drew up in the shiny Jaguar. It was a question in need of a lengthy answer - none of which touched on the work of Heisenberg. Plenty of preparation was made for the arrival of the eminent chemist Dr Mary Archer - more commonly known as Lady, long-suffering wife of Jeffrey - in Glasgow yesterday. The binmen had just removed the rubbish; the man from the uni watered the hanging baskets of geraniums, petunias and trailing lobelia. Then Lady Archer swept in in the Strathclyde University car before walking a few yards to allow everyone a picture. Putting the quantum theory aside for a second, it was another opportunity for Lady Archer to belt out her signature tune: Stand by Your Man. This time, though, what with her man residing in the clink, Lady Archer had to rely on her son William. Anyway, she later insisted, her visit to Strathclyde University had nothing to do with her family troubles and must be seen purely in the context of an academic imparting knowledge to learned friends. It is not known whether William shares his mother's interest in chemical quantum devices which combine aspects of photosynthesis and photovoltaics. But he was obviously showing keen. So, too, was the assembled press pack; a fact not lost on Lady Archer. \"A special welcome to those of you who are new to the field of quantum solar energy conversion,\" she said. They were not the most predictable first words from the wife of a Tory peer who has just been sent down. Lady Archer had hardly signed off the final syllable of \"this is a private academic meeting and I hope you will allow us to get on with our work\", when the consensus prevailed that it was time to ditch scientific theory. \"Did you lie in court?\" asked someone at the back. \"I'm here, as I said, to lead the summer school and I won't be led into discussion about any other matter save to say that I support my husband wholeheartedly,\" replied Lady Archer. To press concern over Jeffrey's welfare in prison, Lady Archer tersely replied: \"I have said what I wish to say.\" This was an academic conference, after all. Poor William, no doubt, was in for an enlightening afternoon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2002/sep/15/features.review37","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2002-09-15T00:18:01Z","webTitle":"The woman in the chador gets my vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/sep/15/features.review37","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2002/sep/15/features.review37","fields":{"headline":"The woman in the chador gets my vote","bodyText":"Secret Ballot (105 mins, U) Directed by Babak Payami; starring Nassim Abdi, Cyrus Abidi O (96 mins, 15) Directed by Tim Blake Nelson; starring Josh Hartnett, Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles, Martin Sheen A Walk to Remember (102 mins, PG) Directed by Adam Shankman; starring Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote Two Can Play That Game (90 mins, 15) Directed by Mark Brown; starring Vivica A. Fox, Morris Chestnut The Trespasser (98 mins, 18) Directed by Beto Brant; starring Marco Ricca, Alexandre Borges, Paulo Miklos There are two characteristics shared by most recent Iranian films. The first is the way apparently realistic movies turn into resonant fables. The second is the manner in which the simple, uncluttered images stick in the mind for their poetic meaning rather than their picturesqueness. Both are true of the latest little masterpiece from Iran, Secret Ballot, written and directed by Babak Payami, who recently returned there after a long period in Canada, where he studied film at the University of Toronto. In the opening sequence of this absurdist comedy, a cargo plane drops a parachute bearing a large box over a desert, where it is retrieved by a burly soldier. He carries it to a small camp beside a shoreline where another soldier is asleep out of doors in a bunk bed. Waiting for Godot comes to mind, and Beckett has been quite an influence on Iranian filmmakers. It tran spires that the large wooden box contains a smaller, white cardboard one - a ballot box, for this is election day. Shortly thereafter, a small craft powered by an outboard motor comes in from the sea and one of the female passengers, all dressed in chadors, walks ashore carrying her socks and boots. Had she been Godot himself the soldiers could hardly be more surprised, because this determined young woman is an election agent charged with gathering votes on this sparsely inhabited Gulf island. Reluctantly one of the soldiers, a dumb, surly type, fulfils his duty by driving her in a battered four-seater scout car from village to village collecting the votes of everyone over the age of 18. Secret Ballot is a funny, touching road movie that simultaneously brings into question the nature of elections, which precious few understand, and celebrates the beneficial possibilities of democracy. Over the hours between her arrival at dawn and her necessary departure at dusk for her more sophisticated, bureaucratic urban world, the educated young woman learns some lessons about remote peasant life (the subject of numerous Iranian pictures). She also builds a relationship of grudging, unarticulated respect with the soldier. A man runs away from them, because he always flees from soldiers with guns, but is captured and his vote gathered. A village run by the unseen matriarch Granny Baghoo is left without a vote being cast because the woman decides that 'Granny Baghoo is the government here'. The agent wheedles and cajoles the potential voters, holding out the prospect of education, flowing water, medical attention, better crops. In desperation she tells an old-timer running a ramshackle solar-energy plant that 'God instructs you to vote'. She buys something from an old pedlar to secure his vote, only to discover when he produces his ID that he is a foreigner. Gradually she moves up to sit beside the driver and eventually persuades him to break the law by jumping a stalled red light at a crossroads out in the desert on an island virtually free of cars. While watching Secret Ballot I thought that this was one of those foreign language movies that Hollywood couldn't remake. Later, however, it struck me just how easily this tale could be transposed to Governor Jeb Bush's Florida, with Susan Sarandon as a prissy representative of an electoral reform group being driven around the polling stations by state patrolman Billy Bob Thornton. Of all Shakespeare's plays, Othello has perhaps received the most varied treatment in the movies. Apart from three more-or-less straight versions starring Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier and Larry Fishburne, and Placido Domingo as Verdi's Otello, it has been set in the London jazz world (All Night Long), made into a rock musical (Catch My Soul); and rendered as a psychological western (Jubal). The latest treatment is Tim Blake Nelson's O, which works very satisfactorily in the setting of an exclusive prep school in South Carolina to which handsome Odin James (Mekhi Phifer) has been admitted for his basketball skills. Naturally he falls in love with the dean's daughter, Desi (Julia Stiles), and incites the malevolent envy of Hugo Goulding (Josh Hartnett), son of the basketball coach, Duke Goulding (Martin Sheen), who treats the black star like a son. It's highly enjoyable and well acted, with the Iago figure better motivated than in the original play, no single line of which has been retained except for the odd echo. It's difficult, however, to get emotionally involved when we're constantly thinking of the ingenious ways in which the plot has been re-worked. It's funny to see Roger (Roderigo) use his mobile to stir up Desi's father, Dean Brable (Brabantio), but there's a laugh in the wrong place when in the climactic basketball game the other high school side is called Stratford. Also set in a high school in the Carolinas, A Walk to Remember is virtually Love Story updated from the swinging 1960s to the solemn 2000s as a vehicle for the teenage singing star Mandy Moore, who plays the deceptively plain daughter of a small-town Baptist preacher (a hammy performance from Peter Coyote). Through her religious faith and love of astronomy, she redeems the school's egocentric heart-throb (Shane West) before succumbing shortly after graduation to one of those incurable Hollywood diseases that have no symptoms. Like the recent vehicles for Mariah Carey and Britney Spears, the film turned out to be less a showcase for Moore's talents than an open casket. Performed by an almost entirely black cast, Mark Brown's Two Can Play That Game is a talkative comedy offering advice to career girls in the corporate fast lane on how to handle their treacherous, lecherous and mostly dependent boyfriends. The beautiful Vivica A. Fox, as a confident, highly paid Los Angeles businesswoman, speaks straight to camera throughout, something of a tour-de-force, though a tedious and arch device given the indifferent lines she has to deliver. The movie's chief interest resides in the contrast between the standard English the women speak in the office and the slangy, obscene, ungrammatical jargon they adopt when getting together with sisters from the hood. Beto Brant's The Trespasser is an uncompromisingly bleak thriller in which two unscrupulous partners in a São Paulo construction company hire a hit man to kill the firm's scrupulous third partner, who has been a friend since engineering-school days. Unfortunately, the assassin, a revolting figure from the city's lower depths, sizes up the pathetic pair and insinuates himself into the business, setting his sights on a young punk heiress who's into coke, tattooing and bisexuality. Strikingly photographed in harsh, desaturated colour, the first half is as tough as any recent Latin American movie, but it gets confused and runs out of steam."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2001/sep/14/conservatives.politics2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2001-09-14T02:24:18Z","webTitle":"Key policies of new leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/sep/14/conservatives.politics2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2001/sep/14/conservatives.politics2","fields":{"headline":"Key policies of new leader","bodyText":"Europe Will downgrade issue to unite Tories.

Eco-tourism is not only about protecting the natural environment but also about heeding the needs of the local community and the sustainability of their way of life. Here is a selection of holidays that you should be able to enjoy while making a positive contribution to the host society. Many of them are community-based, but others demonstrate that larger-scale tourism can play its part. Kawaza village, Zambia Two years ago, some American travellers asked the locals whether it would be possible to stay in their village. The response of the villagers was to build two simple huts for their visitors. These facilities in Kawaza now include a long-drop toilet and screened-off open-air bath. Jackson, the headman, greets guests, who can drink beer with the men and help the women prepare the evening meal. Neighbouring villagers may join the party for dancing. Sunvil Africa arranges visits as part of a tailor-made itinerary in conjunction with Robin Pope Safaris. Sunvil donates its commission to the village's school fund. Sunvil also donates £50 for each booking to the Southern Africa Crisis Appeal, while Robin Pope Safaris contributes £20 per person, per day to Zambian famine relief programmes (though the rains have fallen normally this year). All this means, for example, that a seven-night holiday will contribute £380 towards food aid. This sum, the World Food Programme estimates, will feed 28 families for a month. Where to book: Seven-night itinerary with Robin Pope Safaris costs £2,211 from Sunvil Africa (020-8232 9777, Sunvil Africa). Tiamo resort, South Andros, Bahamas This small resort has been built to strict \"earth-kind\" standards on a beach on the South Bight (tidal creek) of Andros, the largest but least-known of the Bahamian islands. The 12 wooden bungalows - with wrap-around porches, open design and white reflective roofs to conserve energy - sit among coconut palms and seagrape trees overlooking the beach. The resort claims to have the largest solar electricity system in the region, and the bungalows have thermal hot-water heaters. The owners originate from Key West, Florida, but all the staff are local and the resort is involved in environmental projects with the community. There are extensive waste-treatment systems, which is a pleasant surprise in a country otherwise devoid of recycling facilities. Where to book: Seven nights at Tiamo costs from £1,917 all-inclusive with Discover the Bahamas 01737 218803, Discover the Bahamas See also www.tiamoresorts.com Banyan Tree, Phuket At first sight, the resorts at Laguna Phuket appear to epitomise how tourism can despoil a glorious natural setting. But look more closely. The area, Bang Tao Bay, was once a tin mine: a UN report in 1977 described the blackened ground as too ravaged to sustain development. The Banyan Tree Phuket and the other resorts were only built following a decade of work to rescue the land; now, migrating birds are drawn to the inland lakes. The resorts pay for an expanded school and medical facilities for their own staff and the wider community. The Banyan Tree is a low-rise hotel; the villas have landscaped gardens and are furnished in traditional Thai style. There are extensive spa facilities. Where to book: Seven nights, room-only accommodation at the Banyan Tree Phuket costs from £1,695 with Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions (020-7386 4646, Worldwide Journeysand Expeditions). Sarara Namunyar, Kenya The Sambaru people own this safari lodge on the eastern side of the remote Matthews Range in northern Kenya. They are your hosts for game drives, guided bush walks and camel safaris. There are five double luxury tents with ensuite bathrooms; sitting and dining areas are situated on a deck by a natural rock pool. Visitors have direct access to the indigenous culture and are encouraged to get involved in community conservation. But here, the only tourist facility in the Namunyak frontier district, they are also guaranteed privacy and space. Sarara Namunyar is one of several community-owned lodges that are marketed under the Kenyan Portfolio collective of eco-tourism safaris. Where to book: A seven-night itinerary that combines Sarara with other Kenyan Portfolio properties, Lewa Wilderness Trails and Loisaba Starbeds costs from £3,326 with Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris (020-7384 2332, Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris).

Kapawi jungle lodge, Ecuador In a remote corner of the Ecuadorian jungle, accessible only by small aircraft, this lodge on the Pastaza river was built in partnership with the Achuar, a local tribe of Amazonian Indians. It is constructed in traditional style (without a single metal nail); solar energy and rubbish recycling are used. The Achuar take most of the jobs; only the manager, bartenders and naturalist guides come from outside. Built in 1996, the lodge will be handed over to the Achuar in 2011. Guests are invited to visit the tribal communities. Activities include rainforest hikes, river canoeing and bird-watching; there are 500 species in the region plus pink dolphins, giant otters and capybaras (amphibious rodents). Where to book: 10 nights at Kapawi jungle lodge, Casa Mojanda, and Quito costs £1,200 (plus international flights at £550) with fair-trade travel firm Tribes (01728 685971, Tribes). Kipungani Explorer, Lamu Island, Kenya There is a desert-island feel to the setting: an eight-mile strip of palm-fringed white sand, reached by boat after a 90-minute flight from Nairobi. However, this small lodge has been developed in partnership with one of the oldest Muslim communities on the African coast. The 14 chalets are built from local materials, with matting floors and thatch roofs woven by Kipungani villagers. Half the staff come from the village, where all the seafood and repair materials are bought. The lodge has helped rebuild and equip the village primary school; it is \"twinned\" with a London nursery school and guests have contributed to the salary of an extra teacher. Enrolment has risen from 50 to 75 and a kindergarten class has been added. The aim is to preserve the island's traditional seafaring culture and to protect the fragile mangrove and marine ecosystems. Where to book: Seven nights at Kipungani Explorer costs from £1,690, including full board, flights and transfers, with Okavango Tours (020-8343 3283, Okavango Tours).

This pristine coastal wilderness is one of South Africa's poorest regions. (It was the former Transkei \"homeland\".) The white sand beaches are littered with shipwrecks; inland are dense coastal forests and spectacular waterfalls. The project, part-funded by the European Union, offers riding, hiking and canoeing trails in the rugged territory, between the Mzamba and Mtentu rivers, of the Amadiba Tribal Authority. Visitors are led by local guides and stay in camp sites, village huts and comfortable lodges; traditional meals are served. Where to book: A four-day trail costs £95. Book through Rainbow Tours (020- 7226 1004, Rainbow Tours). Half Moon Club, Montego Bay, Jamaica This golf, tennis and beach club has won a succession of international awards, including two green globes, for its environmental initiatives. To control the insect population, ditches were cleared and stocked with fish that eat mosquito larvae; these in turn attract nesting tropical birds. Among conservation mea sures: waste paper is turned into notepads, food waste is composted, treated water irrigates the golf course and gardens, and jet skiing is prohibited to protect the coral reef. If you book through Caribtours, there's an additional environmental benefit: a donation is made to Caribbean projects funded by Friends of Conservation. Seven nights' room-only at the Half Moon Club, plus flights, costs from £1,215 with Caribtours (020-7751 0660, Caribtours). Sea turtle project, Costa Rica Spend your holiday nights on a Pacific beach helping scientists to monitor threatened leatherback turtles. This hands-on conservation work is one of more than 100 scientific projects organised worldwide by the Earthwatch Institute. Volunteers pay towards the cost of the project (and their own flights) and work as expedition members under the direction of the scientists: no qualifications are needed. The Indio-Pacific population of leatherback turtles is on the brink of extinction. This 11-year project seeks to halt rampant egg poaching and to monitor the nesting turtles. Where to book: Volunteers contribute from £1,195 for a nine-day assignment at the sea turtle project. Details from Earthwatch (01865 318838, Earthwatch).

Lee Coates, managing director of independent financial adviser (IFA) the Ethical Investors Group, based in Cheltenham, says it is no contest, and at his firm, pensions business is booming. \"Awareness of ethical investment has never been so high and we're finding around 60% of our business is for stakeholder pensions,\" he said. \"They're low cost and for a long term investment like a pension it is less of a problem that equity markets are so poor now. Many people are looking at 20 years or more down the line and so it's good to buy now while prices are cheap.\" A major concern about investing in an ethical fund is that performance will be sacrificed for ethics. However, the established view among investment experts seems to be that returns from ethical funds are in line with those that are not ethical. The Ethical Investment Research Services found five ethical indices it created proved approximately equivalent to the FTSE All-Share Index. It found the Charities' Avoidance Index, for example, which excludes the vast majority of companies involved in tobacco, gambling, alcohol, military sales and pornography, was 0.38% greater than the All-Share. If you're part of a large company scheme, members united in their views are a powerful force and should be able to put pressure on fund managers to invest ethically. Pension funds constitute around a third of UK funds and if there is outcry over a certain company's dealings, it can hit them hard. Many will be aware that oil companies, for example, are doing far more now to promote the fact that they are looking at less harmful ways to produce energy and limit the damage they cause. If you agree to a fund where oil is allowed, the manager may put pressure on the company to focus on areas such as solar energy. Even as an individual you can choose an ethical fund, and supporting a charity can also make a difference. For example,War on Want's Invest in Freedom campaign seeks to mobilise the power of institutional investors to get multinational companies to adopt better labour standards. Unions GMB and Unison have circulated campaign packs to their members. Other unions, including MSF and TSSA, have given War on Want access to pension fund trustees. The charity says even the multinational companies are responsive, as they are keenly aware of the bad publicity that could follow a refusal. Setting up your own ethical pension If you want a pension, the chances are a stakeholder plan will be your best bet. Anyone buying into an ethical fund will find there are less choices that if they were to select from the mainstream market. Mr Coates, however, says there are ample choices to meet most investors' criteria. \"Axa, Standard Life, Norwich Union and Friends Provident are some of the main providers we use. Our clients all have different requirements. They could be opposed to animal testing, care about environment matters or want to avoid alcohol or tobacco gambling. We provide them with a detailed questionnaire and then select the pension funds that fit in with their preferences.\" You can invest in a stakeholder plan from £20 a month. But, if you have substantial amounts to stash away, you can also invest in a standard personal pension. This may have higher charges, but will mean wider access to funds. The fund managers may say they need to charge more to conduct extensive research. An independent financial adviser specialising in ethical investment is best placed to recommend a plan. Mr Coates adds: \"There are some good funds out there, but it's vital to take into account the individual's age and attitude to risk. Norwich Union's Absolute Growth Fund is run on ethical lines but can be a roller coaster. For a younger person, it could be ideal, though.\" One company he is less happy with is NPI, one of the best known ethical fund managers. \"They've had some great performance, but they will only accept pension plans from £150 a month. For me, that's too high. Providers should not be excluding anyone from starting a pension.\" Make sure your company scheme is ethical If you are in a company scheme and want to know where your money is going, don't forget you now have the right to find out. This is because since July 2000, pension fund trustees have been required to disclose the approach taken by fund managers in their Statement of Investment Principles. This is a document that they are duty bound to produce and make available to scheme members. These disclosure rules apply not only to large pension schemes, but also to company stakeholder plans, which all firms employing five or more staff must offer. However, there is a catch with company stakeholder plans. If you ask the pension provider offering the scheme to provide you with a Statement of Investment Principles, they are not duty bound to do this until you sign up - something of a Catch 22 situation. In this case, you should try and do as much research as you can on the funds in question and ideally seek advice - or ask your employer to intervene. Many company pension plans now offer an ethical option for employees. And, if you are earning a high salary and want to top up your pension through additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), then you should also be able to access ethical funds. If you're in a pension scheme that is not run on ethical lines, don't give up pressing for change. Charity Friends of the Earth is campaigning for companies to listen to what pension holders want and last year found many businesses were prepared to listen. But it also found that many still put few obligations on fund managers to engage actively with the firms in which they invest to ensure ethical standards. According to its research, Friends of the Earth found many local authority pension funds were run on ethical lines and BT also had a good record. The worst performers were Pilkington, Marks &amp; Spencer and Rover Group, which all failed to adopt any ethical investment principles. A number of firms did not respond or refused to cooperate with the survey, including Ford, Abbey National and Sainsbury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2002/jun/18/schools.uk4","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2002-06-18T08:49:38Z","webTitle":"Earth diplomats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jun/18/schools.uk4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2002/jun/18/schools.uk4","fields":{"headline":"Earth diplomats","bodyText":"Sustainability is a long word that can mean anything a politician wants, but Rhys Davis, a 17-year-old A-level student from Pontyclun in Mid Glamorgan, knows exactly what it means and why it's important. \"We're all really into this sustainable development thing now - it's something that' s going to make the world a much happier place to live in, with a better environment,\" he says. \"For me the most important topic is fair trade. I want to ask Blair how he's going to make fair trade happen; what his policies are.\" Following a national schools competition, Rhys was given his chance last week. As the Worldwide Fund for Nature's (WWF) \"earth champion\" for Wales, he will go to the giant United Nations Earth summit in Johannesburg in August, where more than 100 world leaders are expected to sign up to new commitments to help the world's poor and the environment. But before Johannesburg, Rhys and other WWF earth champions from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were invited to Downing Street to meet Tony Blair and Margaret Beckett, the environment secretary. They met in the garden of No. 10 and the politicians listened intently as the children laid out their concerns about pollution, trade, biodiversity, third world poverty, energy and water. \"We share your concerns. That is why we have taken action in the UK to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increased our support to developing countries to reduce poverty and increase access to clean water,\" Blair told the children. Margaret Beckett, just back from Bali and the last preparatory meeting for the summit, was upbeat: \"You have seized on the big subjects which we will tackle at the summit. The voices of young people will be heard loud and clear in Johannesburg and I want them to know now they are important. They are the future. We want to make the world a better place for them and for generations to come. It's up to us all to make it work and to make it happen.\" The children were, up to a point, impressed. \"Blair was well into his renewable energy, more than I'd expect, like he'd read up on it,\" said Rhys. \"He used facts and statistics a lot. He didn't really make any promises, but he listened and answered our questions.\" Stephanie Wiseman, the Scottish champion, was impressed when the prime minister told her that wave power could provide London \"with power 10 times round\". Renewable energy enthusiasts later thought the PM was being a bit optimistic here. Sometimes children state the obvious in a way that politicians and adults can't. Peter Burton, 10, Northern Ireland's champion, told Mr Blair that sustainable development was really important. \"If we ignore it, the world will just be completely destroyed,\" he said. Tim Green, 10, the English winner, cut through much of the endless waffle about pollution by saying: \"Obviously the poorer countries do sustainability already, because they don't have cars.\" But the Downing Street meeting shows that when it comes to the environment and developing countries, children are being taken more seriously by politicians than they were even 10 years ago, and that \"sustainable development\", which all countries signed up to 10 years ago at the Rio Earth summit, is now on the radar of many pupils and schools. Peter's school, Ballymena primary in County Antrim, will now conduct a sustainability audit, plant an orchard, develop adventure trail areas and introduce recycling. \"It's important to recycle and reuse stuff. One of the problems is to help more countries join the Kyoto protocol [to limit greenhouse gas emissions]. I'd like to see people in the third world helped more, too. We cannot just ignore children and let them starve,\" he says. Rhys's school, ysgul Gyfun Llanhari, has been given £15,000 by the WWF to create a piece of theatre that will tour other schools and address issues such as waste reduction, energy efficiency and pollution. Governors, parents and pupils will be involved. \"It's made the school much more sustainable. The school environment is much cleaner, and it's all natural food now, no GM,\" he says. The English winner was Brixington Junior in Exmouth, Devon, where the teachers and pupils are trying to bring sustainable development issues into the curriculum and want to promote sustainable lifestyles in their community. They came up with the idea of a trail. The grounds are to be divided into areas like \"inspiration\" and \"creativity\" zones, and a \"sustainable\" cabin, powered by wind and sun, is to be built as a resource centre and extra classroom. Meanwhile pupils at Stephanie's school, Lunnasting primary in Shetland, have been looking at the school's energy needs and alternative energy. With the help of the WWF grant, they will get a wind turbine and install solar energy. This should save the school thousands of pounds a year and help the children to understand the need for clean energy around the world. Stephanie Wiseman so impressed the Scottish first minister, Jack McConnell, that she will now be on the official Scottish government delegation at the summit. Other schools had ambitious plans to raise awareness about sustainable development. Ringmer Community College, East Sussex, had its plan to do a complete energy audit of the school shortlisted. The school of St Helen and St Catherine, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, has planned a major recycling, composting and energy saving scheme. Tile Hill Wood School and Language College, Coventry, wants to assess the sustainability of Coventry Council and the school and to develop recycling and composting projects. Meanwhile Upton Cross primary school, Cornwall, is trying to calculate and reduce the school's ecological footprint and hoping to install an alternative energy system. Hawthorn primary, Newcastle, wants to create a community resource bank of free recycled materials. The four British representatives will not be alone in Johannesburg. They will find hundreds of children from around the world representing the 3 billion people under 18 in the world and find the message of youth being shouted clearly. Last month more than 650 children from all over the world debated the issues and came up with 50 challenges for world leaders that will be given to delegates. \"We want clean water and clean air for everyone,\" said Analiz Vergara, from Ecuador, who will also be in Johannesburg. \"These are basic human rights, not privileges. The challenges we have developed represent the children - the next leaders - and the hope for our future. We must make sure that governments listen to us.\" Last summer the Woodcraft Folk charity attracted 4,000 children from 40 countries to its international camp and after electing representatives came up with sophisticated demands, including the cancellation of all debt, more rights for asylum seekers and no privatisation in schooling or health services. These will also be presented to the Johannesburg delegates. Children, it is increasingly seen, have the greatest stakes in sustainable development. As the most vulnerable group of people in the world, they are unable to make their own decisions and are dependent on adults. \"You have the right to grow up free of poverty and hunger. You have the right to grow up on a clean and healthy planet, with access to safe drinking water,\" the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, told a UN children's meeting last month. World leaders might not like talk of rights, but the children would agree."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2002/mar/28/shopping.internet","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2002-03-28T01:43:11Z","webTitle":"Ask Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/mar/28/shopping.internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2002/mar/28/shopping.internet","fields":{"headline":"Ask Jack","bodyText":"Anti spam I've been trying to send email to a legitimate business client but my outgoing mail server has been accused of spamming and is blacklisted by SpamCop. BT Openworld seems to be powerless to deal with it. Gerry Woolf Rottingdean Jack Schofield replies: I am strongly in favour of SpamCop and similar services, which blacklist ISPs (internet service providers) who allow spammers to send bulk unsolicited commercial email. Some ISPs block all mail from the offending addresses until they close any open mail relays or cut off the spammers they are hosting. Ultimately, they could be driven out of business as their customers defect to rivals. Of course, blacklisting makes life difficult for innocent bystanders, but it seems to be the only way to put pressure on ISPs to do the right thing. In this case, the refuse message says 62.172.195.247 has been blacklisted listed below. and a Whois search (I use www.geektools.com/cgi-bin/proxy.cgi ) confirms that the blacklisted IP address is in a block registered to BT. You are, in effect, being prompted to apply whatever pressure you can to support@bt.net and any senior staff you can find. I do not know who uses this IP address, but it has been blacklisted 11 times since November 21. The first time, it was delisted in less than two hours. It was last delisted on February 19, and SpamCop last received a spamming complaint about it less than an hour ago, at the time of writing.

I have ADSL so sending stuff electronically is nice and fast. Joia Shillingford JS: If you still have a modem, you can use a voice line to send faxes directly, without affecting your broadband internet connection. If not, Kevin Savetz keeps a FAQ (answers to Frequently Asked Questions) on sending faxes via the net. This is a good place to start, but it does not seem to cover InterFax. The TPC Fax project is also worth a look. You would obviously want to test a couple of approaches before using them for anything serious. Notebooks I am thinking about purchasing a laptop, but have reservations, including price. The specs that would suit me are: must be lightweight; ability to see screen outdoors with sun shining; long battery life or ideally one that can be recharged by solar energy. It must also have all the specs of a PC: DVD/CD-R etc. Mary Ramsay JS: We would all like one of those but they don't exist. Choosing a notebook PC is an exercise in compromise, and requires that you give up almost everything you want to get the one thing you must have. Some people (eg me) are willing to give up the CD, the floppy, the big screen and the speed in order to get a small ultra-portable with long battery life. Others want a desktop replacement and don't mind if it is big and heavy, and the batteries don't last very long. Dell and IBM have websites where you can choose a suitable machine and add the extras you would like while watching the price go through the roof. If buying retail, Toshiba has a wide range of machines, which offers the best chance of getting something close to an acceptable compromise. I have also had good experiences with Hewlett-Packard and Acer notebooks. However, this is not an area where buying cheap, non-brand systems is without risk. Backchat · Last week, Martin Saunders reported that an unknown file (K0A4U6.ldb) was listening for internet connections and wondered if it was a Trojan. Sam Wahid says Microsoft Access uses .LDB files to hold information about users with access to a database. If one person is changing the data, it locks the database to prevent other users from doing that at the same time. · Robert Moore responded to another item last week. \"Your instructions on altering the Send To menu were just what I wanted,\" he wrote, \"but they only work on my Windows 98 machine. There is no Send To folder in Windows Me.\" Well there is, of course, but it had not occurred to me that people might not be able to see it. As usual, it is Microsoft's fault. It thinks users are better off not knowing about file extensions and system files and folders so, like Apple with resource forks, it does not display them. This makes the PC look simpler and may stop people randomly deleting vital files, but it also creates dangers. For example, you could be tempted to double click an email attachment called Sexy.txt because you think it is a text file. However, it is actually a virus called Sexy.txt.vbs but Windows has hidden the giveaway Visual Basic Script extension. On balance, then, I think it is best to unhide these files and folders. To do this, run Windows Explorer, select Tools|Folder Options and click the View tab. Under Hidden files and folders, put a dot in the radio button that says Show hidden files and folders, and the SendTo folder in Windows Me should reappear. You can also untick the box next to Hide file extensions for known file types."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2001/jul/17/leadersandreply.mainsection","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2001-07-17T09:01:27Z","webTitle":"Leader: Nasa plane has moral for Bush","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/17/leadersandreply.mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2001/jul/17/leadersandreply.mainsection","fields":{"headline":"Flying in the sun","bodyText":"Helios, the sun god, used to drive his divine gold and silver-wheeled chariot across the sky every day.

True, it promised to save the planet by reducing carbon emissions. But the technology was ugly, incredibly expensive and you needed half an acre of panels to make a cup of tea. A shortage of landed billionaire green nerds meant that it never quite fulfilled its potential. Today, though, thanks to a combination of technological advance and government support - together with a pinch of design consciousness - solar power is making a major comeback. Popular interest in alternative energy has risen in tandem with concern about the ecological fate of the planet. According to recent research, even cloudy old Britain receives 750 times more solar energy than its annual electricity consumption, and that if every roof in the UK used solar energy, we could close all our power stations. During its lifetime, just one solar-powered house would save more than 34 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. This interest has been matched by a revolution in the design of solar technology, with solar panels making way for solar slates. Whereas solar panels used heat from the sun to warm water, solar slates convert light into electricity using photovoltaic semi-conductors. In fact, they don't even need a heatwave - they work best in cold, clear conditions. And the slates are very beautiful as well, available in any colour you want - red, pink, yellow, gold, grey, purple with stripes - anything except black (because it's less efficient than the other colours). No wonder they're getting noticed. Designer Paul Smith recently had a solar installation in the window of his flagship shop in London's Covent Garden, and trendy advertising cooperative St Luke's is to cover its new building in solar slates. They're even on the Big Brother house. Soon, solar slates will be a feasible option for everyone else, too. According to Solar Century, one of the UK's leading companies in the field, the cost of generating solar power is a fiftieth of what it was in the 70s, and a fifth of what it was just five years ago. \"Replacing an ordinary roof might cost around £4,000 for a typical three-bed house; a solar roof costs four times as much,\" says Solar Century's Michelle McKenna. \"But the difference is far less in new buildings. And solar energy is expected to reach price parity with conventional energy within five years.\" You don't have to have a whole new roof, though. A door-sized panel, say, to go on your roof, your shed or against a wall, costs around £450, and can power a 100-watt light bulb free for 20 years. There are even portable 60-watt solar mats, at £550, that can power a laptop computer from your sun lounger. Still, at £16,000 a roof, it wouldn't be surprising if most people gave solar power a wide berth, and plumped for a new Volkswagen instead. Unless, that is, it came built-in with a new home. Laing Homes, the mass housebuilder, has been successfully selling Britain's first purpose-built solar houses for between £5,000 and £8,000 more than their non-solar neighbours. Work is just finishing on an estate in Edmonton, north London, where the three-bedroom solar houses are on the market for £147,500 and upwards. \"Electricity bills should be in the very low hundreds annually, and the houses should fetch a good resale value,\" says a Laing spokesman. On older, less energy-efficient buildings, the savings can be even greater. Nigel Boatswain, 39, a computer salesman, bought his three-bedroom Edwardian terraced house in Richmond, Surrey, with solar tiles already installed. His house cost no more than other houses in the area, and, as far as he's concerned, the best thing about them is that they make no difference whatsoever to his life. \"You wouldn't know they were there unless you looked under the stairs, where we have two meters, one to show how much electricity we consume and one to show how much we produce,\" he says. \"The really clever thing, though, is that the house generates power during the day, when we aren't there, which is then sold to the national grid. We buy it back later on in the evening, when the solar panels aren't working but we are using energy.\" The only other difference is visible on Boatswain's electricity bills. \"They are about half of what they might otherwise be, so I save £300-£400 a year. I'm not particularly green, and I would have bought a house in the area anyway, but the chance to help the planet at such little cost to myself seemed too good to miss.\" There's more to come, too. The government is expected to invest heavily in alternative technology, perhaps in the form of grants to help up to 70,000 homes become solar powered. Building societies are in the early stages of developing \"solar mortgages\", which will allow solar owners to spread the cost of installation. With world energy prices set to rocket over the next decade, it's clear that solar power can only get bigger, and closer to home. • For advice, contact PVUK (the association of solar suppliers), 0118 932 4418.

To his fans, he is DJ Shadow: \"the original DJ saviour\", suggests one gushing website; the man responsible for creating 1997's Endtroducing, the greatest dance album ever according to a recent magazine poll. His speciality is creating spine-tingling atmospheres from unlikely musical sources. Give Davis a bag of old records, it is reputed, and he can transform them into a \"sound collage\", evoking anything from a deserted churchyard to a motorway. It seems unlikely, however, that even he has considered creating music evocative of the vista before him: a petrol station forecourt on the outskirts of north London. The trail that led us to this salubrious locale began with a simple idea: why not take Davis record shopping? After all, he is renowned for making records out of other people's records. Every last note on both Endtroducing and its follow-up, The Private Press, has been extracted from somewhere within his gargantuan collection, which fills several locations around California. \"I often wish I could call someone up and ask them to come and play bass on my record, but for me, that would be a cop-out,\" he sighs, with the resignation of a man who gave up fighting his own fanatical tendencies long ago. Davis is the sort of person who says things like: \"A record dealer near my house had a 50%-off sale, so I bought a few thousand records and took them home,\" in the offhand way that most people discuss a trip to the supermarket. He has, he admits, permanently injured his neck by nodding along to hip-hop records over the years. The problem is that Davis, 28, doesn't really bother with record shops any more because, as he politely explains, he already has nearly every record in them. \"It's hard for me to find records I've never seen before,\" he says with a smile. \"These days, if I find a record I haven't seen, I'll probably buy it.\" So instead of shopping for records, Davis suggests a visit to a private dealer who provides him with vinyl so rare that it never makes it to the shops. Tracked down via a series of phone calls, said dealer immediately begins behaving in a manner that suggests he is trading in unlicensed weaponry rather than old hip-hop singles. We can go over, but we must not reveal his name, or even the area of London in which his house is situated. In fact, he won't give us his address at all - we must drive to a nearby garage, where he will meet us. \"This is all very clandestine, isn't it?\" frowns Davis's press officer, but the man himself seems unabashed. \"It makes sense,\" he says. Presumably barmy record dealers are an occupational hazard in the life of DJ Shadow. Another, he claims, is the kind of mania that descends during the making of his albums. As no instruments are involved, there is no rehearsal. Davis simply locks himself away with a pile of records, searching for a few seconds of music worth using. \"I kind of switch off my brain, and it's a feverish process of, 'Look! I can use this! I can do this with it!' I can go through a couple of hundred records in one session doing that.\" Once inside the mystery record dealer's vinyl fortress, we are offered a glimpse of what Davis's studio madness might look like. Confronted by a rickety shelving system stuffed with records, the producer's eyes become slightly glassy, like an alcoholic who has unexpectedly found himself locked in an off-licence. Conversation is pointless. A sniff of vinyl and Davis is transformed into a cross between a dotty old professor and a teenager with attention deficit disorder: \"Woah! Vaughan Mason, that's rare... Woah! This single comes with a lyric sheet, but these lyrics are wrong. What was I saying?\" His wife, he says, is \"used to it\" - he has been like this since his early teens, when he heard Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel's The Message on the radio. By 14, he was hosting his own radio show. At university, he had his own rap act, Solesides, and was producing remixes. Most were rejected, but one, a remix of an African group called Zimbabwe Legit, found its way to James Lavelle, a west London record-shop assistant who, in his spare time, ran a record label called MoWax. Lavelle put out another DJ Shadow production, 1993's In/Flux. It's not an exaggeration to suggest that In/Flux changed the face of music. With its painfully slow beats and languid orchestral samples, it defined a new genre: trip-hop. Today, you can hear its echoes in everything from film soundtracks to pop singles. Two supposedly low-key mix albums, Brainfreeze and Product Placement, have also become the stuff of legend: so successful that the rare funk singles they contained have rocketed in value thanks to Shadow's seal of approval. Not everything in Davis's career has gone smoothly. Psyence Fiction, his 1999 collaboration with Lavelle under the name UNKLE, was trip-hop's Titanic: vastly expensive, critically mauled and a commercial flop. With its expensive videos, stellar guests (Richard Ashcroft, Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Beastie Boy Mike D), Psyence Fiction has gone down in history as a folly that ended the trip-hop movement. Defensive of the album's musical content, Davis is more equivocal on the subject of its presentation. \"I was a willing participant in the chaos that was UNKLE,\" he says. \"My philosophy was just to get on with the music and leave the rest of it to other people. We had differences of opinion on the way that record should have been presented. I didn't think then that it was a good idea to go around telling people that it was an Apocalypse Now. In my opinion, that was a bit presumptuous to say the least.\" His demeanour speaks less about his immersion in the street culture of hip-hop than it does about his upbringing in Davis, California, a middle-class town that was \"the first place in America to harness solar energy, and one of the first to ban smoking in public\". Its solitary rappers, Tio and the DCB Posse, shot their record sleeves in nearby Sacramento - nowhere in Davis looked appropriately tough. Accordingly, Josh Davis is a polite, teetotal, drug-free non-smoker. His baggy B-boy clothes are neat, his goatee beard meticulously trimmed. Plenty of men obsess over records, football programmes or model trains, but Davis is in the rare position of having turned his obsession into something approaching a pop-art form. Regrettably, its devotees dub it \"turntablism\". One of the reasons that dance music sounds so formulaic is that producers chase after the same currently fashionable sounds. Davis does the opposite: \"Whatever I put in is, in effect, what comes out. So if I put in things that are off the beaten track, chances are my music's going to sound very different.\" The Private Press, for instance, contains intriguing twists and turns built on the most inventive of sources: obscure psychedelic albums, recordings of Utah bell-ringers, and the privately pressed records that lend the album its title. They are rock's equivalent of vanity publishing, released by artists that no label will touch. \"They all look the same,\" explains Davis, who is inevitably something of an expert. \"They have a blank white jacket with a picture of the person who made it. I was really inspired by them. They must have thought they had nothing to lose. They woke up one morning and thought, 'Right, I'm gonna make a record.' There was zero chance of them making any real impact, but it didn't matter, they just wanted to express themselves.\" Eventually, Davis emerges from the dealer's shed, clutching an obscure single called The Professor Is Spacewalking and Sleepwalking. \"Strange title, huh?\" he says. A mumbled transaction takes place. Money changes hands. What if it's rubbish? He smiles. \"If I go through a record and there's nothing I can use it for, I just chuck it into storage, and it can just sit there until I can look at it with fresh eyes.\" He never gets rid of anything, then? Davis looks aghast. \"No. The last thing I tried weeding out of my collection was late 80s R&amp;B. Now that stuff's worth a ton of money. You gotta hang on to them.\" He looks momentarily concerned. \"I don't want to come off like a vinyl snob.\" Does he mean someone for whom record collecting is an all-encompassing passion, to the exclusion of everything else? \"Yeah.\" He brightens. \"I mean, I buy CDs as well.\" · Private Press is out on Island/MoWax on June 3."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theguardian/2001/jun/22/guardianleaders","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2001-06-22T00:47:22Z","webTitle":"Leader: Sun alliances","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/jun/22/guardianleaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2001/jun/22/guardianleaders","fields":{"headline":"Sun alliances","bodyText":"Hail O sun! You really had a splendid day yesterday. At Stonehenge, you appeared at a summer solstice dawn for the first time in years, delighting thousands of pagans, druids, witches and spiritual tourists. To cap that, you put on a marvellous show in southern Africa, with a total eclipse that crossed Botswana, Zambia and some of the poorest countries on earth. But is it in your power, we ask, to beam in on the mind of energy and industry minister Brian Wilson? British policymakers have long embraced the forces of darkness and the solar industry explosion now surging around the world has barely registered here, though it does power the Big Brother house. Global production of photovoltaics last year jumped to 288 megawatts, a 43% rise on 1999, and the price dropped too, both as result of governments pump-priming the industry. Germany has allocated more than £320m over the next 10 years, Japan £700m and the US over £50m to devel oping the industry. Yet Britain produces less than 1MW a year from a mere 166 roofs, and intends to spend just £10m over three years. We must move faster or be eclipsed. The UK could combine the best of others' programmes. The Japanese model could be used to provide loans to homeowners who cannot afford the installation cost. We could also follow Germany, which pays a premium for solar energy to companies wanting a faster return on their investment. To be fair, the government has moved in the past year - its white paper proposes a welcome 100,000 solar roofs. But it is hazy about timetable and there is little sense that it will really support this nascent industry that energy analysts believe may grow faster than any other in the next decade. Britain's priority should be the creation of a manufacturing base and encouraging builders to install the technology. Then we could celebrate a genuine vision of a sustainable future every year at the summer solstice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2001/dec/12/climatechange.society","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2001-12-12T16:02:49Z","webTitle":"Within these walls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/dec/12/climatechange.society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2001/dec/12/climatechange.society","fields":{"headline":"Within these walls","bodyText":"Only 20 years ago, Sue Roaf's house in Oxford would have come out of a science fiction novel. Thermal insulation, energy efficiency appliances and solar energy from photo-voltaic panels means that her traditional looking semi not only emits hardly any carbon from fossil fuels but is a power station in its own right, exporting surplus electricity back to the grid. Roaf, like many other energy pioneers, thinks all new home building should follow suit. \"My house emits a hundred times less carbon dioxide than other similar houses around here,\" she says. \"Just imagine the impact if all new houses did this.\" The imagination boggles. In the next five years, some 3.7m new homes will be built in the UK, the great majority by giant companies of housebuilders. Given that individual households are presently responsible for one third of all energy use in the UK, and that 80% of this goes on heating, these builders could, if they chose, dramatically improve Britain's environmental performance by building truly energy efficient homes. Research suggests that not only would fewer new power stations have to be built, but pollution levels would drop, new industries would be stimulated and less money would have to be spent on just keeping warm. Although builders are very wary of anything that delays building programmes or adds costs, there's far more awareness of \"sustainability\" issues among them than popular prejudice might imagine. Many now have environmental management systems and policies on sustainability. Some have pilot eco projects. Wilson Connolly builders have used thermal insulation to great effect in the Life Building Project in Northamptonshire. Countryside Homes has developed the \"village\" of Great Notley where great attention has been paid to enhancing the local environment . And many of the major companies are part of the consortium building the energy efficient sustainable Millennium village in Greenwich. Laing has positioned itself as the market leader in new housing sustainability, and believes this makes good economic sense. In 1993 they signed up to the WWF's buyers group and pledged to acquire timber products only from \"sustainable sources\". They remain the only mass builders to do so. They have a company-wide code of practice on sustainability which covers everything from brownfield site development to company cars and recycling office and site waste. Currently 90% of their building is on brownfield sites. Recently they completed a private development in Edmonton using state of the art photo-voltaic roof tiles. Sarah Durham, who heads the Ecology fund of Jupiter Asset Management, says there's scope for improvement on energy efficient housing, but insists that other measures contribute to sustainability in a wider sense. These include environmental land assessment, adding value to sterile agricultural land or brownfield sites by including provision for wildlife, situating developments close to facilities, and general insulation. Durham says builders are now being squeezed in the right direction. Increasingly councils won't give planning permission unless the developers have addressed sustainability issues, she says. Building regulations also now demand much higher standards of insulation. Cecelia Bagenhome of the government's Building Research Establishment (BRE) says new energy efficiency ratings for homes are making customers more demanding. \"You wouldn't buy a car without asking what's in the engine, and increasingly people are going to think like that about what's in their house walls,\" she says. David Baker technical director of the HouseBuilders Federation says these changes have largely gone unrecognised. \"The old cliche of box bashers covering the land in concrete are out of date. The average build on brownfield sites is already 57% even though the government target is 60% by 2005.\" He feels that mass builders must unfairly carry the weight of expectation about energy efficiency. \"All new houses are four times as energy efficient as Victorian ones. If the government has a limited amount of money to spend on improving energy efficiency, it might be better spent on improving leaky old stock rather than clobbering newly built houses with endless regulations,\" he says. One place that housebuilders are looking is the Peabody Beddington Zero Energy Development in west London, which demonstrates the huge gap between current standards in mass building and what is possible. \"BedZed\", as it is known, is a mixture of social housing, private houses and low-cost housing. There's nothing new about the technologies employed but their combination is radical. BedZed uses passive solar heating: south facing glass to warm the house; combined heat and power boilers using bio waste; dense thermal insulation; and photo-voltaic panels to power the development's electric cars. Architect Bill Dunster thinks the project could only have happened with clients like a housing trust. \"Peabody is interested in tackling fuel poverty, urban regeneration and quality of life improvements across the board.\" They were also able to raise grants for renewables. Did he think of going to private developers with the idea? \"They didn't even return my calls\", says Dunster. The push from customers will be critical in the development of sustainable housing. Everyone in the building trade agrees that it's only a matter of time before house purchasers get the hang of renewables and energy efficiency offering them inflation-proof energy while simultaneously contributing to global solutions. Architect Bill Dunster has more reason than most to believe the change is coming. The demand for the private homes on the BedZed development is exceptionally high and private developers are \"quite literally hanging over the fence watching\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2001/jun/28/physicalsciences.highereducation","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2001-06-28T10:18:46Z","webTitle":"Breaking the ice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/jun/28/physicalsciences.highereducation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2001/jun/28/physicalsciences.highereducation","fields":{"headline":"Breaking the ice","bodyText":"The ice age is coming\" sang the Clash in the 70s, and headlines shouted, \"Brace yourself for another ice age.\" Even lyrics of pop songs come from somewhere, and these arose because some thought that the world was facing a frozen future. In an era of global warming, the idea of ice sheets covering half of Europe in the next few centuries seems ridiculous. But some scientists in the early days of climate modelling were anticipating a colder world. The story begins in the early 20th century with a Serbian astrophysicist, Milutin Milankovitch, who believed that wobbles in the earth's orbit around the sun had a profound effect on the earth's temperature and devoted his career to developing a theory based on these principles. Milankovitch predicted that ice ages occurred at particular orbital variations of the earth, when less solar energy reached its surface at northerly latitudes. From the position of the earth's orbit he calculated the temperature 600,000 years ago. After initial enthusiasm, no one paid much attention to Milankovitch's ideas until the late 60s, when a study of deep sea sediments showed that ice ages occurred at times which fitted in with Milankovitch's theory. Patterns in the earth's orbit can be predicted accurately. So could the next ice age be foretold? The exact orbital conditions which give rise to cool summers in northern latitudes (thought to trigger ice ages) are uncertain. As William Connolley, climate modeller with the British Antarctic Survey says: \"The connection between solar radiation at certain latitudes and the onset of ice ages is not as certain as people once thought.\" The earth has probably already passed the peak of the current interglacial period, and if Milankovitch's rules are followed - leaving aside human influence - then a trend towards a cooler climate would be expected within the next 1,000 years. But even 30 years ago, the powerful warming effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide was well known. But CO2 has rivals in the greenhouse world. Aerosols thrust into the atmosphere from the very same process that generates CO2 - the burning of fossil fuels - act as atmospheric coolants, reflecting solar energy back into space. At the time it was not known which would control atmospheric temperatures. The \"cooling\" argument was backed by temperature measurements from the northern hemisphere which showed a cooling trend from the 40s to the 70s. Armed with 100 years of temperature readings from around the world, climate scientists of the 70s tried to estimate how hot the world would be in future. Whether they predicted a rise or fall in temperature depended on the emphasis given to CO&lt;-&gt;2 or aerosols, and on the timescale of the calculation - Milankovitch cycles cover huge time periods, so predictions based on orbital cycles with an accuracy closer than 2000 years are not possible. Some stark claims were made. In 1971 the journal Science reported that if atmospheric aerosol concentrations increased eightfold, then the subsequent cooling \"if sustained over a period of several years _ is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.\" The threat of a nuclear winter at that time - with dust from an atomic explosion blocking out the sun - weighed heavily on the public's mind, so it is easy to see where headlines about a future ice age came from. Dr Connolley has studied the issue of whether an imminent ice age was predicted in the 70s and believes that the argument depends on how you define \"imminent\". \"If you work on greenhouse-type timescales then 'imminent' means the next century or so,\" he says. \"In this case, the scientific papers from the 70s show no evidence of predictions of an 'imminent' ice age.\" Nigel Calder, former editor of New Scientist and atmospheric researcher disagrees. In his book The Weather Machine, published in 1974, he wrote: \"One might argue that there is a virtual certainty of the next ice age starting some time in the next 2000 years. Then the odds are only about 20-to-1 against it beginning in the next 100 years.\" As the debate continued, it became clear that the greenhouse effect of CO&lt;-&gt;2 overrides the cooling force of aerosols. The 30-year northern hemisphere cooling trend stopped in the 70s, and scientists realised that if temperatures of the southern hemisphere were included in their models, then no global pattern of cooling was observed anyway. Does the fact that some scientists predicted the wrong trend in the 70s mean that the international consensus about the current warming trend could be misguided too? \"The volume of evidence for the greenhouse effect today far exceeds that available for global cooling in the 70s,\" says Dr Connolley. \"You didn't find government ministers going to a meeting about global cooling like they went to the Kyoto global warming summit.\" But the \"Ice Age is Coming\" headlines of the 70s have an important modern resonance - sceptics use them to discredit global warming theories. In the 1999 Reith Lecture, Anthony Giddens said that \"only about 25 or so years ago, orthodox scientific opinion was that the world was in a phase of cooling. Much the same evidence that was deployed to support the hypothesis of global cooling is brought into play to bolster that of global warming - heat waves, cold spells, unusual types of weather.\" While Prof Giddens has a point, it is untrue to suggest that the scientific consensus about global cooling was anything like that in favour of global warming today. And the next ice age? The earth has been oscillating between long glacial periods about every 100,000 years. Will it do so again? Dr Connolley says, \"Without any human interference, there would certainly be an ice age at some point in the future. But inputs of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere have almost certainly overridden any effects of orbit-related cooling for the next few hundred years.\" • Dr Alison George is with the British Antarctic Survey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2002/feb/14/usnews.globalwarming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2002-02-14T17:56:26Z","webTitle":"George Bush's global warming speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2002/feb/14/usnews.globalwarming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2002/feb/14/usnews.globalwarming","fields":{"headline":"George Bush's global warming speech","bodyText":"Thank you very much for that warm welcome. It's an honour to join you all today to talk about our environment and about the prospect of dramatic progress to improve it. Today, I'm announcing a new environmental approach that will clean our skies, bring greater health to our citizens and encourage environmentally responsible development in America and around the world. Particularly, it's an honour to address this topic at NOAA, whose research is providing us with the answers to critical questions about our environment. And so I want to thank Connie for his hospitality and I want to thank you for yours, as well. Connie said he felt kind of like Sasha Cohen - I thought for a minute he was going to ask me to talk to his mother on his cell phone. I also want to tell you one of my favourite moments was to go down to Crawford and turn on my NOAA radio to get the weather. I don't know whether my guy is a computer or a person. But the forecast is always accurate, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank you for your hard work, on behalf of the American people. I appreciate my friend, Don Evans's leadership. I've known him for a long time. You're working for a good fellow, if you're working at the commerce department, or at NOAA. And I want to thank Spence Abraham and Christie Todd Whitman for their service to the country, as well. I've assembled a fabulous cabinet, people who love their country and work hard. And these are three of some of the finest cabinet officials I've got. I want to thank Jim Connaughton, who is the chairman of the council on environmental quality. He's done a fabulous job of putting this policy together, a policy that I'm about to explain. But before I do, I also want to thank some members of Congress who have worked with us on this initiative. I want to thank Bob Smith and George Voinovich, two United States senators, for their leadership in pursuing multi-pollutant legislation; as well as Congressmen Billy Tauzin and Joe Barton. And I want to thank Senator Chuck Hagel and Larry Craig for their work on climate issues. These members of Congress have had an impact on the policies I am just about to announce. America and the world share this common goal: we must foster economic growth in ways that protect our environment. We must encourage growth that will provide a better life for citizens, while protecting the land, the water, and the air that sustain life. In pursuit of this goal, my government has set two priorities: we must clean our air, and we must address the issue of global climate change. We must also act in a serious and responsible way, given the scientific uncertainties. While these uncertainties remain, we can begin now to address the human factors that contribute to climate change. Wise action now is an insurance policy against future risks. I have been working with my cabinet to meet these challenges with forward and creative thinking. I said, if need be, let's challenge the status quo. But let's always remember, let's do what is in the interest of the American people. Today, I'm confident that the environmental path that I announce will benefit the entire world. This new approach is based on this common sense idea: that economic growth is key to environmental progress, because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies. This new approach will harness the power of markets, the creativity of entrepreneurs, and draw upon the best scientific research. And it will make possible a new partnership with the developing world to meet our common environmental and economic goals. We will apply this approach first to the challenge of cleaning the air that Americans breathe. Today, I call for new clean skies legislation that sets tough new standards to dramatically reduce the three most significant forms of pollution from power plants, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. We will cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 73% from current levels. We will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 67%. And, for the first time ever, we will cap emissions of mercury, cutting them by 69%. These cuts will be completed over two measured phases, with one set of emission limits for 2010 and for the other for 2018. This legislation will constitute the most significant step America has ever taken - has ever taken - to cut power plant emissions that contribute to urban smog, acid rain and numerous health problems for our citizens. Clean skies legislation will not only protect our environment, it will prolong the lives of thousands of Americans with asthma and other respiratory illnesses, as well as with those with heart disease. And it will reduce the risk to children exposed to mercury during a mother's pregnancy. The clean skies legislation will reach our ambitious air quality goals through a market-based cap-and-trade approach that rewards innovation, reduces cost and guarantees results. Instead of the government telling utilities where and how to cut pollution, we will tell them when and how much to cut. We will give them a firm deadline and let them find the most innovative ways to meet it. We will do this by requiring each facility to have a permit for each ton of pollution it emits. By making the permits tradeable, this system makes it financially worthwhile for companies to pollute less, giving them an incentive to make early and cost effective reductions. This approach enjoys widespread support, with both Democrats and Republicans, because we know it works. You see, since 1995 we have used a cap-and-trade programmeme for sulphur dioxide pollution. It has cut more air pollution, this system has reduced more air pollution in the last decade than all other programmes under the 1990 Clean Air Act combined. And by even more than the law required. Compliance has been virtually 100%. It takes only a handful of employees to administer this programme. And no one had to enter a courtroom to make sure the reductions happened. Because the system gives businesses an incentive to create and install innovative technologies, these reductions have cost about 80% less than expected. It helps to keep energy prices affordable for our consumers. And we made this progress during a decade when our economy, and our demand for energy, was growing. The clean skies legislation I propose is structured on this approach because it works. It will replace a confusing, ineffective maze of regulations for power plants that has created an endless cycle of litigation. Today, hundreds ofms of dollars are spent on lawyers, rather than on environmental protection. The result is painfully slow, uncertain and expensive programmes on clean air. Instead, clean skies legislation will put less money into paying lawyers and regulators, and money directly into programmes to reduce pollution, to meet our national goal. This approach, I'm absolutely confident, will bring better and faster results in cleaning up our air. Now, global climate change presents a different set of challenges and requires a different strategy. The science is more complex, the answers are less certain, and the technology is less developed. So we need a flexible approach that can adjust to new information and new technology. I reaffirm America's commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention and it's central goal, to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Our immediate goal is to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy. My administration is committed to cutting our nation's greenhouse gas intensity - how much we emit per unit of economic activity - by 18% over the next 10 years. This will set America on a path to slow the growth of our greenhouse gas emissions and, as science justifies, to stop and then reverse the growth of emissions. This is the common sense way to measure progress. Our nation must have economic growth - growth to create opportunity; growth to create a higher quality of life for our citizens. Growth is also what pays for investments in clean technologies, increased conservation, and energy efficiency. Meeting our commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by the year 2012 will prevent over 500m metric tons of greenhouse gases from going into the atmosphere over the course of the decade. And that is the equivalent of taking 70m cars off the road. To achieve this goal, our nation must move forward on many fronts, looking at every sector of our economy. We will challenge American businesses to further reduce emissions. Already, agreements with the semiconductor and aluminum industries and others have dramatically cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases. We will build on these successes with new agreements and greater reductions. Our government will also move forward immediately to create world-class standards for measuring and registering emission reductions. And we will give transferable credits to companies that can show real emission reductions. We will promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as well as nuclear power, which produces no greenhouse gas emissions. And we will work to safely improve fuel economy for our cars and our trucks. Overall, my budget devotes $4.5 billion to addressing climate change - more than any other nation's commitment in the entire world. This is an increase of more than $700m over last year's budget. Our nation will continue to lead the world in basic climate and science research to address gaps in our knowledge that are important to decision makers. When we make decisions, we want to make sure we do so on sound science; not what sounds good, but what is real. And the United States leads the world in providing that kind of research. We'll devote $588m towards the research and development of energy conservation technologies. We must and we will conserve more in the United States. And we will spend $408m toward research and development on renewables, on renewable energy. This funding includes $150m for an initiative that Spence Abraham laid out the other day, $150m for the freedom car initiative, which will advance the prospect of breakthrough zero-emission fuel cell technologies. My comprehensive energy plan, the first energy plan that any administration has put out in a long period of time, provides $4.6bn over the next five years in clean energy tax incentives to encourage purchases of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, to promote residential solar energy, and to reward investments in wind, solar and biomass energy production. And we will look for ways to increase the amount of carbon stored by America's farms and forests through a strong conservation title in the farm bill. I have asked Secretary Veneman to recommend new targeted incentives for landowners to increase carbon storage. By doing all these things, by giving companies incentives to cut emissions, by diversifying our energy supply to include cleaner fuels, by increasing conservation, by increasing research and development and tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean technologies, and by increasing carbon storage, I am absolutely confident that America will reach the goal that I have set. If, however, by 2012, our progress is not sufficient and sound science justifies further action, the United States will respond with additional measures that may include broad-based market programmes as well as additional incentives and voluntary measures designed to accelerate technology development and deployment. Addressing global climate change will require a sustained effort over many generations. My approach recognizes that economic growth is the solution, not the problem. Because a nation that grows its economy is a nation that can afford investments and new technologies. The approach taken under the Kyoto protocol would have required the United States to make deep and immediate cuts in our economy to meet an arbitrary target. It would have cost our economy up to $400bn and we would have lost 4.9m jobs. As President of the United States, charged with safeguarding the welfare of the American people and American workers, I will not commit our nation to an unsound international treaty that will throw millions of our citizens out of work. Yet, we recognise our international responsibilities. So in addition to acting here at home, the United States will actively help developing nations grow along a more efficient, more environmentally responsible path. The hope of growth and opportunity and prosperity is universal. It's the dream and right of every society on our globe. The United States wants to foster economic growth in the developing world, including the world's poorest nations. We want to help them realise their potential, and bring the benefits of growth to their peoples, including better health, and better schools and a cleaner environment. It would be unfair - indeed, counterproductive - to condemn developing nations to slow growth or no growth by insisting that they take on impractical and unrealistic greenhouse gas targets. Yet, developing nations such as China and India already account for a majority of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and it would be irresponsible to absolve them from shouldering some of the shared obligations. The greenhouse gas intensity approach I put forward today gives developing countries a yardstick for progress on climate change that recognises their right to economic development. I look forward to discussing this new approach next week, when I go to China and Japan and South Korea. The United States will not interfere with the plans of any nation that chooses to ratify the Kyoto protocol. But I will intend to work with nations, especially the poor and developing nations, to show the world that there is a better approach, that we can build our future prosperity along a cleaner and better path. My budget includes over $220m for the US agency for international development and a global environmental facility to help developing countries better measure, reduce emissions, and to help them invest in clean and renewable energy technologies. Many of these technologies, which we take for granted in our own country, are not being used in the developing world. We can help ensure that the benefits of these technologies are more broadly shared. Such efforts have helped bring solar energy to Bangladesh, hydroelectric energy to the Philippines, geothermal electricity to Kenya. These projects are bringing jobs and environmental benefits to these nations, and we will build on these successes. The new budget also provides $40m under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act to help countries redirect debt payments towards protecting tropical forests, forests that store millions of tons of carbon. And I've also ordered the secretary of state to develop a new initiative to help developing countries stop illegal logging, a practice that destroys biodiversity and releasesms of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And, finally, my government is following through on our commitment to provide $25m for climate observation systems in developing countries that will help scientists understand the dynamics of climate change. To clean the air, and to address climate change, we need to recognise that economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand. Affluent societies are the ones that demand, and can therefore afford, the most environmental protection. Prosperity is what allows us to commit more and more resources to environmental protection. And in the coming decades, the world needs to develop and deploy billions of dollars of technologies that generate energy in cleaner ways. And we need strong economic growth to make that possible. Americans are among the most creative people in our history. We have used radio waves to peer into the deepest reaches of space. We cracked life's genetic code. We have made our air and land and water significantly cleaner, even as we have built the world's strongest economy. When I see what Americans have done, I know what we can do. We can tap the power of economic growth to further protect our environment for generations that follow. And that's what we're going to do.

But the creation of Newark and Sherwood council's groundbreaking Energy Agency happened almost by accident. In 1985, the Nottinghamshire council was forced to bring its unfit housing stock up to scratch after years of inaction. Of the 7,500 council-owned homes, just 6% were deemed capable of delivering affordable energy to vulnerable households. The council knew it had to take action: doctors were blaming the poor health of their patients on the cold and damp council homes and tenants were complaining en masse. Once the £7m scheme to improve the homes' energy efficiency was under way - with everything from roof insulation to energy saving light bulbs - officers and councillors realised there were long-term savings to be made. As a result of their decision to maintain the impetus, 92.6% of all the council's homes have this year been classed as energy efficient. The agency's work extends to raising awareness of energy efficiency in schools. At Bowbridge junior, located on one of the most deprived estates in Newark, pupils have performed plays and carried out school projects on how to conserve heat and light. The agency is also behind the Sherwood Energy Village - a plan, featured in Society last year, to transform a 91-acre former colliery in Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, into an energy-efficient, environmentally sustainable village with renewable energy sources. \"We got into energy efficiency through a serious health problem,\" admits Energy Agency director David Pickles. \"But we've gone on to develop strategies across the board. There are wider, knock-on effects: the savings to the health service because of a drop in cold-related illnesses; savings to the landlord; the creation of jobs as improvements are carried out. \"Reduced fuel bills also mean people have a greater disposable income to spend on the local economy. The ways local authorities can boost energy efficiency may be simple - roof insulation, cavity wall insulation, draught proofing - but the payback is huge.\" Other authorities championing energy efficiency include Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which is an enthusiastic advocate of solar energy, and York, which runs the Planet York initiative to lower CO2 emissions, install insulation and introduce a fleet of council vehicles running on LPG, natural gas or electricity. Local authorities should be in no doubt as to their crucial role in fighting climate change and creating local energy efficiency targets. Fuel poverty is a beacon council theme for 2002; the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit launched a national review of energy policy in June; and environment minister Michael Meacher has made clear he wants councils to play a much greater role in fighting climate change. But despite the work of some councils, and behind the eco-friendly rhetoric and well-intentioned pledges, worrying numbers of local authorities are failing to tackle the issues. A recent survey by the Energy Saving Trust, a not-for-profit organisation behind this week's \"energy efficiency week\", makes depressing reading. One in three of 284 councils questioned will fail to meet the government's target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010. Furthermore, half the authorities questioned did not know what proportion of their community lived in fuel poverty - despite the fact that the issue is a beacon council theme for next year. The survey also found that most authorities did understand the importance and benefits of a sustainable energy and transport policy, but fewer than half knew how to tackle climate change at a local level and a third did not have a climate change strategy in place. When questioned on energy efficiency in council buildings, a third said their buildings did not meet the criteria and almost half admitted that their transport fleet was not environmentally friendly. Now the trust is calling for councils to place climate change and affordable energy at the heart of their policy making. On Friday, for the first time, director-level officers and senior councillors are expected to attend the trust's local authority strategy group. The aim of the group is to share good practice and encourage authorities that are lagging behind to learn from more innovative councils. It is hoped that the participation of senior local government figures will mean that the subject will be taken more seriously. According to Eoin Lees, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust, variation in how well councils tackle the problem depends simply on the commitment of individual officers and members. \"Local authorities are well placed to deliver local energy efficiency plans - they need to take advantage of that fact,\" says Lees. \"As local leaders, if they endorse something, people usually take their lead. And as well as their leadership role, authorities can set an example by improving the energy efficiency of their own housing stock and other council buildings such as offices and schools.\" · The Energy Saving Trust has a helpline for local authorities on energy information and advice, at www.practicalhelp.org.uk or on 0870 241 2089."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2002/mar/31/shopping.ethicalliving","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2002-03-31T15:41:18Z","webTitle":"Innovations 100 - The Environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/mar/31/shopping.ethicalliving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2002/mar/31/shopping.ethicalliving","fields":{"headline":"How the land lies","bodyText":"Radical environmentalism has moved into the mainstream. For instance, the only people who now deny climate change are those 100 per cent funded by big business. They're now the minority in the way that the 'greens' were 10 years ago. People are finally waking up to the idea that we're walking into a health nightmare and this is reflected by increased interest in buying local, organic produce through Soil Association campaigns. We are beginning to reconnect with the producer and localise the economy, which should ultimately have positive effects on health, reduce waste and limit climate change. The best innovations solve problems rather than cause them: GM crops, in my view, are not the solution to global hunger. By contrast, inventions like the wind-up radio and the desert cooling system - which is cheap to make and based on local knowledge - are genuinely inspiring innovations that change lives.

Low-energy hemp houses have sprung up in Suffolk and 1998 saw the completion of earth-sheltered houses in Nottingham. High costs are still deterring private developers from energy-saving schemes, but they are starting to peek over the garden fence. 2. Organic movement When organic food and farming was legally defined in the UK in 1992, the \n<a>Soil Association was poised to take centre stage. It is now the main organic-certification body in the UK, with 4,000 organic producers under its chemical-free umbrella. One of its biggest achievements has been to harness public fear over conventionally farmed food and channel it into the organic-food market. Critics say the health benefits of organic food have not been proven and that it is too expensive. The Soil Association counters that cheap food costs us environmentally, and says we should buy local, seasonal, organic produce in a move away from industrialised agriculture. It is taking heart from the recent Curry Report, which advocates a 'sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector'. 3. GM food In 1996, an innocuous-looking tomato arrived in the UK and a battle began. Named the 'flavr savr' it contained antisene genes to delay the ripening process and represented the UK's first brush with genetically modified food. The GM welcoming committee quickly crumbled and by 1999 the debate was epitomised by the destruction of GM test sites by activists and a running storyline on The Archers. Exponents including biotech giants Monsanto, maintain genetic manipulation can eradicate weaknesses in crops, enhance positive characteristics and alleviate global food shortages. Opponents of 'Frankenstein food' cite genetic pollution, contamination, direct health implications and irreversible environmental damage. While UK bodies such as the Royal Society are calling for major testing programmes, global GM planting has increased unabated and was up by 15 per cent last year. · The Royal Society GM research project is one of the best sources for detailed information on the scientific debate over GM food. 4. Right to roam The traditional 'get off my land!' cry of the landowner seemed consigned to the past when the 'Right to Roam' act was passed in November 2000. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act, to give it its proper title, gave everyone statutory rights of access to mountains, moor, heath, down and registered common land in England and Wales. The act became characterised as a battle between shotgun-wielding landowners and pesky ramblers. Crucially, English Nature was given powers to protect Sites of Specific Scientific Interest. There are over 4,000 SSSIs across the country, all unique wildlife- and geology-rich areas. But the majority of gardens are safe from Sunday strollers for the time being - maps showing just where walkers do have the right to roam won't be finished until 2005. 5. Plastic recycling Last year, more than 250,000 water bottles were recovered from over 200 recycling schemes and kerbside collections. Since a dedicated recycling plant opened in West Yorkshire in 1991, initiatives have picked up speed and redundant plastic has been transformed into everything from chairs to pencils. But there is still much to be done to meet 1997 targets calling for 20 per cent of plastic to be recycled by 2006. That's no small task when you consider that we get through three million tonnes of it every year in the UK. Opponents to plastic recycling say we should focus on the real issue of reducing a dependency which sees Tesco stores giving away 40 million carrier bags a week. 6. Eco tourism The World Tourism Organisation predicts that by 2020 1.5 billion of us will be trotting round the globe. Within this travel frenzy, eco-tourism is touted as one of the biggest growth areas. International guidelines for environmentally friendly tourism were established in Paris in 1995. To qualify as eco travel, the industry should make a low-impact on the environment and local culture, while helping to generate income and jobs, and conserve local ecosystems. In practice, the validity of the eco label is often dubious. A backpacker can do as much damage tramping through unchartered rainforest as a busload of tourists visiting a popular site with the relevant infrastructure. Eco tourism has become progressively sophisticated as travellers look for an authentic hands-on environmental experience, whether it's integrating with eco communities in Ladakh or hanging out with the Bedouin. 7. PV technology Last summer's Big Brother unearthed one genuine star. You just had to look on the roof to find it in the form of the 141 photovoltaic solar modules. Solar Century's ground-breaking panels not only provided clean energy but a possible solution to our dependency on fossil fuels. PV solar cells don't require blazing sunshine. A small amount of light hits a cell stimulating layers of silicon and generating electricity via an inverter the size of a laptop. Excess energy is then fed back into the National Grid. In Germany, 10,000 homes have been kitted out through investment over the past decade. In the UK, developments such as Brian Ellis's PV traffic lights are promising but a widespread PV revolution requires hard cash. 8. Wind-up radio A 1991 TV documentary on the spread of HIV in Africa inspired Trevor Bayliss to come up with a wind-up radio. He recognised that remote African communities needed a means of accessing health and news broadcasts that didn't rely on mains electricity or batteries. The Freeplay radio, launched in 1995, uses a clockwork mechanism connected to a dynamo. It has been a big hit in South Africa and also provided a vital link for people all over the world, including refugees from Macedonia and Albania. Bayliss says anyone who has 'slightly more perception than the average wrapped loaf' is capable of invention. But few innovations are as significant as the Freeplay radio, now selling at a rate of 120,000 a month. 9. Desert cooling system When Mohammed Bah Abba mixed the second law of thermodynamics with his own background he revolutionised life for rural Nigerian communities. In 1995 the business lecturer from Jigawa turned the traditional cooking pots his grandparents used to make into a refrigeration system. The 'pot-in-pot' is just that: a large pot containing a smaller one. The space in between is covered with moist sand and perishable goods are placed in the inner pot. In communities without electricity, where temperatures routinely top 40 degrees, a dietary staple such as the aubergine now lasts 27 days rather than three. Three-quarters of households in Jigawa now use this piece of indigenous technology, which sells for the equivalent of 25p and its popularity is spreading fast to other desert regions. The refrigeration system has helped to stem disease, given new opportunities to a whole generation and halted rural migration in some areas. Not bad for a couple of earthenware pots. 10. The Eden Project Built on a former china-clay quarry, the world's largest geodesic 21st century garden has just celebrated its first birthday. Who would have thought an environmental project could rescue St Austell from the economic doldrums and be deemed so sexy that the 20th Bond movie would be filmed there? Creator Tim Smitt sees Eden as an opportunity to convey the importance of the relationship between people and plants. He intends it as a genuine force in the battle for environmental sustainability and biodiversity rather than a glorified theme park. This builds on the structure's own eco story. Some 85,000 tonnes of soil have been created from china clay and organic waste, recycled water is pumped round the biomes and a vast solar-energy system stores heat through the night. Whether Eden will have a bearing on our eco destiny remains to be seen, but it's certainly got pulling power. More than two million people visited in its first year. The Future The planet's future has an aquatic theme. Ideas being floated include the transportation of fresh water in huge nylon bags and the towing of icebergs. These schemes have grown with the threat of global water shortages by 2050 - experts estimate it could effect half the population. The role of H2O as a valuable commodity has even sparked fears of future water wars. Meanwhile, scientists are racing like Bond villains to develop effective systems of weather control. Huge advances are expected in cloud-seeding, a procedure using silver iodine that could potentially manage rain fall. Could we see a rain-free Wimbledon one day?</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/2001/jul/20/conservatives.archer2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2001-07-20T00:49:40Z","webTitle":"Why Mary stood by Archer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/20/conservatives.archer2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2001/jul/20/conservatives.archer2","fields":{"headline":"Why Mary has stood by her man","bodyText":"Flushed and sweating, Mary Archer walked into the couple's central London penthouse in shorts and a T-shirt after an exercise session. Jeffrey Archer, hosting a meeting with ethnic leaders during his ill-fated campaign to be the capital's mayor, jumped up: \"Ah, Mary. You are looking sexy. Isn't she looking sexy?\" His wife, seeking the safety of the bathroom, answered: \"I've been in the gym.\" Yet there was to be no escape. Archer insisted on her joining the group, saying: \"I'd like you to meet some very important Londoners.\" So she joined the gathering where, according to his former aide Stephan Shakespeare who retold the incident, she made all the right noises about London's cultural diversity. Lady Archer may be long-suffering but friends maintain she is also loyal, confidently predicting she will stand by a man who yesterday added imprisonment to the public humiliations endured during 35 years of marriage. In the Monica Coghlan libel trial she wowed judge and jury when Mr Justice Caulfield's summing up famously referred to her fragrance, elegance and radiance. In the perjury trial she was back on the stand, dressed in black, looking decidedly younger than her 56 years and describing herself as \"a busy working mother\". Referring to \"my husband\" except when the questioning was intense and he became \"Jeffrey\", she said it was a full, happy marriage, though admitted: \"We've explored the further reaches of 'for better and for worse' than most couples.\" No foresight But she was unable to save him for a second time. Friend and author Sheridan Morley said: \"I don't think half these troubles would have happened had he sat down and talked them through with Mary. He genuinely doesn't think things through. He is not troubled by foresight.\" Lady Archer is haughty and self-assured, disdainful of those, including the Old Bailey judge and barristers, who threatened their lifestyle. Three admonishments were delivered by the trial judge Mr Justice Potts as, unprompted, she tried to dwell on their relationship. \"We'd all get along better if you'd just answer the questions,\" he told her sharply. Lady Archer appears to enjoy the trappings of her husband's success as a novelist - designer label outfits, black BMW, renovated 17th century Old Vicarage once occupied by Rupert Brooke and frequent trips abroad which must be the envy of her colleagues in the poorly remunerated world of academia. When she consented to his bid to be mayor of London, Lady Archer insisted on four Bruce Oldfield outfits to accompany him on the stump. A side of her character which may stem from their near-bankruptcy of the 1970s after a disastrous business deal, however, means she can also be frugal. She flies economy class and buys tickets from bucket shops, much to his annoyance. His public prominence opened doors - including membership of the \"great and the good\", with seats on a string of boards and trusts - that might otherwise have remained firmly bolted to a very good, though not brilliant, scientist in the relatively obscure field of solar energy. She even turned the indignity of the Coghlan case in her favour, with appearances on Desert Island Discs, Any Questions and a Channel 4 New Year's Eve programme in which she sprawled across a grand piano in a low cut dress and performed Tom Lehrer's comic song \"The Elements\". Mary and Jeffrey Archer are an odd couple by the standards of most other people. \"It's not a normal relationship and by most people's standards it would be extremely difficult to justify,\" said one of the couple's closer friends. \"It might be harsh to describe it as a marriage of convenience but that it what it appears to be. Jeffrey needs Mary and by the same token Mary needs Jeffrey, too. It is a mutually reinforcing marriage .\" The accountant's daughter was born Mary Doreen Weeden in Epsom, Surrey, in 1944 into a decidely middle-class family and went to the blue-stockinged Cheltenham Ladies' College. Bookish and bright, she passed A-levels at 16 and by 17 had embarked on a four-year chemistry scholarship at St Anne's College, Oxford, where she gained a double first followed by a PhD in heterogeneous catalysis - reactions between gases, liquids and solids - at Imperial College, London. During her Oxford days she appeared on the front of Cherwell, the student paper, holding a kitten under the cringe-inducing headline \"poor little pussy\" and stepped out with a string of boyfriends before meeting and marrying Jeffrey in 1966. In what can now be considered an omen of the rough rides ahead, his van ran out of petrol between the wedding reception and the honeymoon hotel. A series of academic posts followed, first at Oxford, then Cambridge including chemistry lectureships at Trinity and Newnham from 1976 to 1986. There were directorships including seats on local radio stations and for eight years until 1995 a place on the board of Anglia TV during which Jeffrey was accused of using inside information to help a friend buy shares in the Norwich-based network. After that particular embarrassment, she is believed to have told him she could put up with no more humiliations. Lady Archer's tougher side was glimpsed when she chaired the Lloyd's hardship fund during the insurance underwriting scandal of the early 1990s. Insult was added to injury when members facing ruin discovered the fund's aim was to get them to pay up without going bankrupt, Lady Archer acting as a debt collector rather than a helping hand. She remains a fellow of Newnham college, a senior academic fellow at Leicester's De Montfort University and is a visiting professor at Imperial. She serves on the Department of Trade and Industry's energy advisory group and a committee to promote science; she is a trustee of Addenbrooke's hospital, Cambridge, and the Science Museum, London, sits on the council of Cheltenham Ladies' College and is president of the Guild of Church Musicians. She spends most weeks at Grantchester, the family's Cambridgeshire home, where she has an office in the garden, and Jeffrey joins her at weekends. Lady Archer has confessed to being unable to leave home without emptying the wastepaper baskets and invented a sauce bottle with a removable bottom so the last dollop of ketchup could be used. The manufacturers Heinz declined an offer to buy the patent. A striking dark haired figure with a porcelain face, the mother of two grown up sons is not short of male admirers. One newspaper was required to publish a correction after appearing to suggest a romantic involvement with a named male. Calculating She has described their marriage as \"the attraction of opposites\" and some associates claim she is shy, giving little away to guests at the champagne and shepherd's pie parties thrown by her husband. \"Mary chooses her words with extreme care,\" said a frequent guest at the couple's Grantchester summer parties. \"Unlike Jeffrey who is impetuous, she is calculating. You might talk to her but you could never call it a conversation because she gives nothing, absolutely nothing, away.\" A fellow scientist remembers once hoping she would get drunk at a conference and let something embarrassing slip about Jeffrey. The group started drinking gin and tonics at 10.30am during a break yet, by the evening, her lips remained firmly buttoned. \"She had a pink face but mine was red,\" he recalled. \"Mary was able to drink me under the table.\" According to one account, Mary corrected Jeffrey's grammar and punctuation in the manuscipt of his debut novel Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less - a book including a \"fragrant, silk-clad wife\" just over 10 years before Mr Justice Caulfield's courtroom eulogy. She is said not to rate her husband's books and he has quipped that he might not live long enough to read hers, though two will be published this autumn, both as far from his airport lounge novels as it is possible to get. Photochemical &amp; Photoelectrochemical Approaches to Solar Energy Conversion has taken 15 years to write and she has also edited Photoconversion: Clean Electricity from Photovoltaics. Neither is ever likely to rival his in the bestseller lists. After her spouse's affair was revealed with the Howard's Way actress Sally Farmiloe, Lady Archer tried to brush it off with the statement: \"We are all human, but Jeffrey manages to be more human than most.\" As he prepares for a spell behind bars, the loyalty of his long-suffering partner surely faces its biggest test yet.

This emerged yesterday as npower, the retail arm of energy group Innogy, joined forces with Greenpeace to launch Juice, \"green\" electricity to be generated by a 30-turbine wind farm generating up to 90mw off the coast of north Wales. It is the first time Greenpeace, the environmental campaigning group which claims 200,000 British supporters, has given its imprimatur to a corporate product - in the hope of prodding ministers into a more proactive role in favour of renewable energy. Juice will initially be marketed to 50,000 domestic customers, equivalent to 1.5% of Welsh electricity demand and offsetting 180,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. \"They are getting their electricity from an offshore wind farm and this is a more powerful statement in the form of putting their money where their mouth is than just signing petitions against greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Stephen Tindale, Greenpeace executive director. New era For Brian Count, Innogy's chief executive-designate, the move is \"a step into a new era\" and one that, via the government's renewables obligation, adds a 3p premium to the wholesale price of \"green\" power that makes profitable his planned £250m investment in wind power over 10 years. Juice, unlike most supplies of green electricity, will cost the same as conventional sources. The normal premium, adding up to 10% on domestic bills, means that just 18,000 British homes have switched, compared with 400,000 in Holland and 80,000 in Germany. Mr Count expects \"more demand than we can cope with\". He said: \"There's a genuine push globally, with or without George Bush, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because there's a real political will. Reaching 10% in the next decade is achievable; it's tough but let's aim high.\" Mr Tindale said: \"It doesn't really matter whether we're at 9 or 11%; what matters is what trajectory we're on.\" There is growing concern within the renewables industry that the government's commitment - designed to help in reaching the self-imposed post Kyoto target of cutting greenhouse gases by 20% by 2010 - is faltering. Just 2.9% of British electricity now comes from renewables, mainly hydroelectric schemes, although the country could theoretically produce four times its entire needs from wind power alone. Many of the bigger producers, including British Energy, Shell and Scottishpower, which this week set out plans for a £150m wind farm south of Glasgow generating 240mw to provide enough energy for 150,000 homes, are investing heavily in this natural resource. So far 450mw comes from wind compared with 2,300mw in Denmark, accounting for 15% of its power, and 6,000mw in Germany. Wind is expected to account for almost half the 2010 target, with 2.6% coming from new onshore developments and 1.8% from offshore farms. Power from solar energy, waves and biomass has barely started, with Philip Wolfe, the chairman of Intersolar, urging government pump-priming to help the industry achieve critical mass and economies of scale. The government, in June, launched an energy review by the cabinet office's performance and innovation unit. Its background paper assumes that renewables will supply 4.6% of power by 2010 - less than half ministers' target. \"They should be asking how to get to that 10% target instead,\" Mr Wolfe said. Mr Tindale said the 10% target might appear ambitious but compared to the available resources it was modest. He cites approvingly an environment agency policy paper, drawn up by Daniel Archard who envisages an \"aspirational\" target of half the country's energy needs being met from renewable sources by 2050 - when all existing nuclear plants will be closed and the country will be importing most of its oil and gas. Blanket opposition Around 1,000 wind turbines are connected to the grid but Mr Count said the government should streamline planning consents to promote further development - and see off opposition from the unlikely source of the Ministry of Defence. He and Mr Tindale accused the MoD of embracing blanket opposition to wind farms because of fears that the giant turbines put at risk low-flying aircraft and key radar installations. The MoD denied that was the case. Officials said it opposed one of eight onshore projects and five of 18 new offshore schemes - not including npower's proposed North Hoyle farm off the coast between Prestatyn and Rhyl. The MoD recently dropped its own plans for a 20km exclusion zone around the coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2000/dec/20/tvandradio","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-12-20T01:31:10Z","webTitle":"Hear this","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/dec/20/tvandradio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/dec/20/tvandradio","fields":{"headline":"Hear this","bodyText":"Steve Lamacq - The Evening Session (8.0pm, Radio 1) sees Steve having a chat with Radiohead in their local pub, where they later perform a set.

To control and reduce the threat requires that the planet as a whole balances its use of fossil fuel as a source of energy with the ability of the planet to safely absorb the byproducts. Solar energy provides about 1,000 times as much energy as the fossil energy used at present and 170 times as much as would be required to maintain all at the same level of consumption as the developed nations. The sensible way is to introduce a UN-managed world wide levy, at source, on the extraction of primary energy products. A levy of 10p per kilowatt-hour would result in fossil energy costing six times as much as renewable forms of energy. The market would then ensure massive research and development of renewable sources. As fossil fuel use is gradually switched to renewable use, the levy would be increased to make replacement even more financially attractive and to conserve the diminishing fossil stocks. This international income, disbursed by the UN, would allow each nation to abolish all forms of taxation which increase the cost of labour. With tax barriers removed, each nation's economy would be able to benefit from the release of the ingenuity and creativity of its own citizens. Of course it won't happen because it requires cooperation between nations and leaders.

Washington's new energy plan, criticised by environmental campaigners, depends on finding new supplies of energy to meet that surging domestic demand. There will be more oil drilling, more power stations, and presidential support for \"the expansion of nuclear energy in the United States as a major component of our national energy policy\". The delivery system will be updated with more electricity transmission lines and oil and gas pipelines. As a means of increasing supply, regulations will be relaxed. This mainly means environmental rules that have hindered energy production and distribution. And any new regulatory legislation will have to be audited for its \"energy impact\", just as government plans are currently audited for their environmental impact. On the demand side, federal funding will be channelled to fuel-efficient technologies and tax incentives will be offered to companies and individuals who use such technology. • Supply The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska will be opened for oil drilling and exploration. Royalties worth $1.2bn (£800m) from the \"environmentally responsible\" leasing of the refuge will go towards research into alternative and renewable energy sources such as wind, solar power, biomass and geothermal energy. Incentives will also be offered for oil exploration off the Florida and California coasts. Two billion dollars will be earmarked for research into clean coal technology, to pave the way for more coal mining. Regulations governing licences for new nuclear power stations will be relaxed, and the approval process will be streamlined. The energy department is to identify a \"safe and permanent\" location for a dump for the country's nuclear waste. • Infrastructure Federal agencies will have the authority to designate land for electric power lines over the objections of local authorities and citizens. An outdated electricity grid was blamed for the California blackouts, because this grid made it harder to divert electricity to the areas where it was most needed. Using new cable technology, a national electricity grid is to be built in place of the current jumble of local networks. Meanwhile, 38,000 miles of new gas pipeline will be laid, along with 255,000 miles of distribution lines • Regulations The regulations governing oil, coal and gas exploitation will be reviewed with the country's energy requirements in mind and \"impediments\" to drilling and mining removed as long as this is \"consistent with the law, good environmental practice, and balanced use of other resources\". Regulations on the siting of new hydro-electric power stations and offshore oil and gas rigs will also be relaxed. Any proposed government regulatory measure would have to include an \"energy impact\" audit. The government department responsible would have to account for the measure's effect on the national energy supply and suggest alternatives. To speed up cross-border energy flows it will be easier to get permits to build transmission connections to Canada and Mexico. • Efficiency and conservation Emission controls for power stations would include man datory reduction targets for sulphur dioxide, mercury and nitrogen oxides. Other emissions would be subject to more flexible, \"market-based\" controls, whereby plants would be given financial incentives to reduce pollution. Tax credits would be given to \"co-generation\" power plants which use the steam from the turbines to provide heating for nearby buildings. Income tax credits would be offered to consumers who buy petrol-electric hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles. A subsidised pro gramme is to be established to build fuel-cell buses. Funding to help poor families weatherproof their homes will be doubled to about $2.5bn (£1.7bn) Meanwhile, any household that uses solar energy will get a tax credit of up to $2,000. Energy Star, a system of labelling products to signal that they use energy efficiently would be expanded to cover more items. The plan suggests that Americans could save 30% on their home energy bills by using Energy Star products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2001/oct/07/energy.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2001-10-07T18:12:54Z","webTitle":"Dan Plesch: Ending oil dependency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/oct/07/energy.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2001/oct/07/energy.comment","fields":{"headline":"Ending oil dependency","bodyText":"Replacing oil as the mainstay of our energy policy should be central to a practical and strategic approach to winning the long-term struggle against terrorism, and would dramatically improving Western policy options in the Middle East.

Even the most hawkish, like US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz, have had to realise that the oil price would triple if they went to war simultaneously with every state they don't care for in the region - even if they were prepared to ride out the other disastrous consequences of such escalation. Even before the attacks on the US, American and Western global strategy gave a very high priority to ensuring access to Middle East oil. This priority translates into a massive investment of taxpayers' money, personnel, military equipment and political capital. 20,000 British troops are in the Gulf today in pursuit of this objective at a cost of a large part of the annual military budget of around twenty billion pounds. The UK and other Western states support dictatorships and absolute monarchs in the region on the grounds that the 'stability' that they bring to our oil supply makes it worth sacrificing our commitment to freedom and democracy around the world. This double standard does much to fuel anti-Western sentiment amongst the peoples of the region. When traditional strategists look ahead to 2020 or 2050 they still see Middle Eastern oil as the key issue in international energy policy. In the UK this view informs the House of Commons investigation into Energy Security which assumes that we will have to import our energy. In the US the now famous Hart-Rudman report on Homeland Defense takes the same approach as does the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Strategy document 'Joint Vision 2020'. Renewable energy can provide a substitute for oil. According to the firm of international engineers BDSP partnership, just 3% of wind resources could provide 30% of global energy needs. Solar power has the potential to provide a similarly limitless capacity. In crude terms, the two sources tend to balance each other with cooler places being windier and vice versa. All three of these energy sources now support mature industries which could be massively and rapidly expanded. In the UK companies such as Solarcentury.com have created viable solar panels for domestic roofing. The main remaining obstacle is that low volume of production is keeping the unit cost high. Wind power is far advanced in other states. In Denmark for example it already provides 14% of national supplies projected to rise to 30% in a few years time. Wind power can be developed in three main ways. Offshore windmills using the platform technology of the offshore oil industry, rural windmills and even windpower in cities. All major car companies have now developed engines using advanced fuel cells running on water. In his Presidential campaign Al Gore went so far as to propose eliminating the internal combustion engine in 25 years. All of these technologies and their industries have matured in recent years (as a quick tour of the websites listed below will reveal). Renewable energy has additional advantages to providing strategic freedom of action in the Middle East. It provides considerable employment. It is decentralised, making it invulnerable to terrorist attack in contrast to large-scale power stations. Unlike nuclear energy, renewables do not bring the risk of catstrophic toxic releases. Many people will be able to make money by selling back to the utility companies surplus energy produced by back-garden windmills and solar roofing tiles. Lastly, of course, the shift to renewables will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But there are three major obstacles which must be overcome before we can take oil off the list of key objectives for our military and foreign policy. These obstacles are the the difficulty of changing official thinking, the vested interests of the oil companies, and the need for a transition strategy. The difficulty of changing the the bureaucratic mindset cannot be overestimated. Previous generations and civilsations offer all too many examples. Before 1914 cars has been around for a quarter of a century and the Ford model T had been introduced in 1908, yet no army started the war with mechanised units and they came late and painfully slowly. The Romans had all the necessary components to make steam engines (iron, pumps and the use of steam in baths) but could not make the leap - probably for cultural reasons. Pre-Columbian civilisations such as the Inca and the Aztecs failed to turn the wheel from a toy into a practical tool. We look back at these follies, comfortable in our our superiority. But are we any better? The power of the oil companies to resist change is immense, though we should note some signs of flexibility. BP and Shell have shown some serious interest in beginning down the renewable route. Today there is a national security imperative to cease our needless reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Luddism from the oil barons would be not just bad for the environment but would also undermine the defence of the West. It might be argued that oil is essential and that we should not let Bin Laden win by giving in. But nobody is proposing that we give up using energy and return to the pre-industrial age. A shift to renewables would merely taking the opportunity of the present crisis to move industrial society ahead a stage. Such national security imperatives have often had beneficial effects. For example the World War 2 bomber provided the technology base for passenger aircraft. The use of oil for energy is a technology whose time is passing, we must hurry up the process A transition strategy to renewable energy should focus attention on the leading industrialised nations of the G-7 and in particular on the EU and the US. Key officials from Washington and Brussels will next meet at December's EU-US summit. This meeting should seek to take key strategic decisions. One strategy to move to hydrogen power cars was mapped out, in a fairly slow way, by Gore - a central plank of this was that governments should announce a date for the transition of their fleets of official vehicles. The EU set a target last month of creating 22% of electricity supply from renewable sources by 2010. This target should be dramatically increased and accelerated by both the EU and the US. In American the policy should fall under the strategy of improving homeland defence through increasing America's self-reliance. Congressional districts, states and counties should develop programs with Federal support. These objectives are far reaching. But they constitute a policy shift the world's strategic environment that we as a public can bring about. Once free of the oil imperative many objectives for reducing the tax burden of defense spending and enabling a stronger world development policy will be easier. We need think no more of the Gulf than we do of the Costa Brava. At a time when many feel all too helpless in the face of unfolding military activity a change in fundamental strategy is something that we can and should work for. As Tony Blair said in Brighton, the kaleidoscope of history is moving and we have a chance to affect the way it settles. Citizens in a democracy must be actors and not just observers or victims. Our forebears obtained the vote, stopped slavery and fought two world wars: is this change really beyond us? Dan Plesch is Senior Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute www.rusi.org.

Each will house one computer with six screens that will form a classroom for the girls and young women of the area. The Starfish Initiative began with a story. A young girl was walking along the beach. The tide was going out and thousands of starfish were stranded on the beach. She went along, picking them up and throwing them back into the water. An old man saw her and asked her what she was doing. \"Look at the hundreds of starfish along the beach,\" he said. \"You can't do any good.\" \"I can for this one,\" she said, and threw it back into the sea. Today's launch of the Starfish Initiative at the Lord Chancellor's Residence at the House of Lords is aimed at bridging the digital divide by providing internet computer access for girls and young women in the world's poorest slums. Behind the scheme is 76-year-old Helen Taylor-Thompson, a direct descendant of David Livingstone. And the pioneering work is motivated by the same fight against slavery. \"Maybe it's in my genes,\" she says. \"Whenever I see something that needs doing, I do it.\" Just how does it hope to achieve that? And why is it specifically targeting girls and young women? A 1994 report from the human rights group Jubilee Action showed that one million children worldwide are lured and forced into prostitution every year. As many as 10 million children are thought to be trapped in pros titution today. Taylor- Thompson sees prostitution as slavery and wants to see an end to it through IT education. \"Slavery is abhorrent to me,\" she says. \"And it's my job to stop it.\" The Starfish container schools will be run by the community leaders, including a team of nuns in Malawi. Through the computers the girls will learn about water, childcare, nutrition and disease control, as well as how to read and write. The three pilot projects will run off electricity, like any standard PC. But, in the next couple of years, the aim is to run similar classrooms of computers on wind power, solar energy, water power, or even by donkey power. After all, how much use is a computer room to a poor community that can't afford the costs of the electricity bills to run it? Internet access will be hard on the heels of basic learning techniques, but the three Rs and a sense of hygiene and nutrition must come first, according to the director of the Starfish Initiative, Stephen Clarke. In Malawi only 42% of women are literate, in Assam, the figure stands at 43%. In Nagpur, just over half can read and write. \"It will give them a glimpse that things can be different,\" he says. \"The fundamental aim is making them feel part of changing their circumstances. That kind of confidence is enhanced through knowledge and education.\" In India, where two of Starfish's classrooms will go, there are an estimated two million prostitutes, 20% of whom are aged under 15. By providing an education Starfish hopes to enable hundreds of young girls to earn a living without resorting to prostitution. \"Prositution is also one of the very best ways of getting Aids,\" says Helen Taylor-Thompson. A member of the French Underground during the Second World War, Taylor-Thompson went on to run the Mildmay Hospital in London in the 1990s, then the first Aids hospital in Europe. She watched thousands of people die, and then more when Mildmay hospitals were set up in the developing world. It was on one visit to Africa that she heard the story about the starfish and the idea for the Starfish Initiative was born. \"I remember a woman who had died of Aids. She had five children. Three had already died of Aids. Two were still alive. There was no one to look after the children. \"The Starfish Initiative is my version of taking them home,\" she says. \"This is giving them something to live for and to stop them getting the most terrible disease.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2001/aug/29/environment.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2001-08-29T01:17:42Z","webTitle":"Comment: The lazy person's guide to saving the planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/aug/29/environment.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2001/aug/29/environment.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"The lazy person's guide to saving the planet","bodyText":"It is not easy to be good. It usually requires time, money, effort, patience, kindness or other qualities in sporadic supply. So here is a chance to be good at absolutely no cost to yourself in time or money - easy virtue just one quick phone call away. Greenpeace has joined up with npower to launch Juice, a new, green electricity supply that for the first time costs exactly the same as ordinary electricity supplies. Juice is building new wind power. Not only is the price for the first time competitive, but the more subscribers sign up, the more new wind power stations will be built by npower. (Other green suppliers use existing old hydro-electric stations, with no promise to build more.) The first new 30-turbine wind power station is planned for a site off the north Wales coast, providing electricity for the first 50,000 subscribers. It will be four miles off-shore, inaudible and virtually invisible. Until it is built, subscribers will get green supplies from existing renewable sources. Once more than 50,000 sign up, another site will be developed, and so on. Phone 0800 316 2610 or click to www.npower.com/juice for instant connection - and instant moral satisfaction, with no cost and no sweat. (They do the change-over from your present supplier.) This is the first time Greenpeace has endorsed a commercial enterprise - answering critics who accuse them of perpetual negativity. There is something refreshingly counter-intuitive about green campaigners lobbying for an energy supplier (they are not being paid or taking any profits). Interestingly, npower - a big commercial player - is marketing Juice as \"clean\" energy as they think the word \"green\" has faintly suspect connotations with non-ideological customers. So far the market for green power is pathetically small - just 18,000 subscribers. But now there is absolutely no excuse why anyone who has ever had a green thought should not convert to Juice today. Spread the word - ask what power family, friends, colleagues and neighbours use. The government has been slow and mean on promoting green energy. While German and Danish wind turbine industries soar ahead with government start-up grants, there is a real danger Britain will lose out on this major new industry. Greenpeace wants to see demand for Juice force the government's hand. With an official target of producing 10% of energy from renewable sources by 2010, so far the government has reached only 2.8%, paying out just £250m over three years to subsidise all renewables. At least £100m a year is needed for wind alone, to lay down cables linking distant wind sites to the national grid. Much more is needed to get solar energy off the ground, to create a big enough market to bring down the cost of solar panels - another gigantic future industry other governments are stealing from under our noses. One problem for wind power has been strong resis tance to giving planning permission for wind farms - even far off-shore. But Greenpeace backing for npower is designed to defuse local protests. Recently planning permission was about to be granted on one off-shore site when a rare hen harrier was spotted and the scheme dropped for \"environmental\" reasons. Greenpeace points out that the hen harrier is as much at risk from global warming as the rest of us without renewable energy supplies. By signing up in great numbers, subscribers will demonstrate public support for wind power. Inertia is the only enemy here. How easy it is to harp on about the government's failings and iniquities without considering what each of us could do. There tends to be a sinking of the heart at the thought of \"doing good\". Will it mean long meetings in dusty parish halls? Does it mean giving up scarce time in this increasingly over-worked country? Abandoning the car? Converting to tofu? Certain Guardian diehards like to write in and boast how they manage on tuppence ha'penny a week, grow their own organics, bicycle everywhere, bring up four children on real nappies, bake their own bread and never owned a television. Alas, such virtue puts off ordinary people from considering the small but easy good they could do without inordinate lifestyle changes. But volunteering is better still (Community Service Volunteers - 0207 239 9556 or www.csv.org.uk). If tax for the high paid feels too low, consider paying a tax-free tithe to charities of your choice (Charities Aid Foundation - 0800 993311). But why do so few people opt for effortless virtue near at hand? Most supermarkets stock some of 70 Fair Trade brands of coffee, tea, chocolate, bananas, sugar, honey or orange juice: the Co-op, Waitrose and Sainsbury's stock the most. The Fair Trade kite mark guarantees poor farmers are not exploited by global corporations and farm workers are not oppressed by near slave conditions. Excellent Fair Trade products now cost the same as other quality goods; 68% of people profess to support Fair Trade principles, so why is only 1% of the coffee purchased Fair Trade? True, most supermarkets tuck it away, but it is not much trouble to bend down to a lower shelf for good high roast, or eschew the Nescafé instant for Cafédirect. Only the poorest have any excuse for not choosing Fair Trade now. Why do green Ecover washing and washing-up products still command less than 1% of the market? Plant-based instead of petrochemical-based, they do far less harm to the environment and cost the same as mid-market deter gents, while working just as well. It is quite easy not to buy a rug without the RugMark kite, guaranteeing it has not been made by children or other exploited workers. It is easy not buy peat bags from garden centres, or garden furniture without the Forest Stewardship Council mark, ensuring it is made from renewable forests. It would save £50-£100 a year in electricity to turn off the television and video instead of leaving them on stand-by. Recycled paper is just fine and cheaper than Andrex. How easy to put a brick in the lavatory cistern to save water. With only a little more bother, in one phone call (0800 905090) you can move your bank account out of the big five monsters into the Co-op bank. (They will shift all direct debits.) The Co-op offers sensible ethical investment (no to animal testing for cosmetics, yes to animal testing for medicines) and its profits are recycled into better rates. In surveys it has the most contented staff and customers who can use the internet, Link machines or any post office to pay money in or out. So why does it have just 3% of the banking market? All these things are dead easy - just a simple shopping choice. So why not? Many more people profess to care than can be bothered to make even these minimal changes. Next time anyone grumbles about what the government has or hasn't done on the green and ethical front, just ask what small things this citizen has done first. p.toynbee@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2000/dec/03/observerescapesection8","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2000-12-03T19:38:19Z","webTitle":"A top concierge reveals all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/dec/03/observerescapesection8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2000/dec/03/observerescapesection8","fields":{"headline":"A top concierge reveals all","bodyText":"So where is Al Maha? Al Maha is an exclusive oasis located 45 minutes from Dubai within a 25 sq km desert conservation reserve. The preservation of desert ecology is the basis of the Al Maha ecotourism project, along with the reintroduction of indigenous wildlife and flora: the concept was initiated by His Highness General Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai. What sort of animals are there? Currently we have 124 Arabian oryx, four varieties of gazelle, eight falcons, Arabian horses, camels and 17 eland. Do the guests rough it too? Not at all. The resort is designed to resemble a Bedouin encampment around a date palm plantation. The guest suites look like tents and each is surrounded by a deck and has its own plunge pool. The bathrooms are particularly spacious and all the furnishings are based on traditional items - we have over 3,000 antiques and art pieces. But there can't be much water in a desert? Al Maha is located on the largest natural water reserves of Dubai. A water recycling plant on the site purifies, recycles and refilters ground water. All waste water is recycled and used in irrigation. We use solar energy to heat water for the staff quarters. What has been your most memorable experience? The success rate of the wildlife breeding programmes has been great and on several occasions guests have witnessed the birth of Arabian oryx calves from the decks of their suites. Our biggest challenge is meeting the expectations of luxury-seeking guests while making the whole experience relevant to the desert location and the region's heritage. Our menus, for example, are international but we also try to introduce typical Gulf food. There are also perceptions of 'Arabian' culture which may not be appropriate in Bedouin culture: what is largely thought of as Arabian in Europe is often Moroccan or Lebanese. What about about a day out in the desert? Activities included in the basic package are falconry, guided 4x4 safari, archery and camel and horse-riding. In the evenings the intention is to provide peace and solitude but there is a very social dune dinner evening. Al Maha reservations: 00 971 4 303 4222 Leading Hotels of the World: 0800 181 123.

Ms Idle, 32, likes the Blue Parrot Cafe range of child-friendly dishes and comes to the Greenwich peninsula store primarily because it is close to their home. The fact that lighting and refrigeration in the 35,000 square foot shop partly comes from a mixture of wind turbines and an environment-friendly combined heat and power - or CHP - system is not irrelevant. \"I am glad they are doing what they are doing,\" says Ms Idle, adding that she was there for the store's \"range of organic fruit and veg\". This is music to the company's ears. Sainsbury's has been quietly promoting a holistic approach to green issues. According to Jayne Harding, environmental manager at the supermarkets group, shareholders, customers and legislators have all pushed for a sea change in business strategies. \"Plans to become more energy efficient and reduce our carbon dioxide emissions are a sign of integrity. It goes along with the recycled matting on the floor, made from aircraft tyres, LPG to fuel cars and organic food,\" she adds. The Greenwich store may look like the set from a science fiction film, with its domed design and propellors, but the aim is to cut fuel bills by up to a half. The com pany is following up trials there by installing a huge wind turbine to power refrigerators at a new depot in East Kilbride. It is not only competitive food retailers that are buying into what analysts are calling the \"new electric economy\". There are some startling success stories. Vestas Wind Systems, the world's largest windmill maker, has seen its share price increase more than 20 times over three years. With good reason - the Danish company made pretax profits of $103m (£74.7m) on sales of $767m last year. Traditional industry has started to take notice of Vestas's success. \"All of a sudden companies such as ABB, General Electric and Westinghouse are thinking seriously about wind power,\" says Vestas's chief executive, Johnannes Poulsen. Another form of green power causing excitement is the fuel cell. A \"clean\" technology which produces electricity and water from hydrogen and oxygen, fuel cells are seen as a solution by many carmakers to exhaust pollutants. DaimlerChrysler has a $1bn fuel cell car project that aims to have an A-class Mercedes on the market by 2004. Toyota plans a fuel cell car by 2010. Indeed, some of the world's biggest polluters have been the first to embrace green technologies. Tomorrow, Shell will outline to analysts in London plans to spend up to $1bn on renewable energy sources, double the amount it forecast in 1997. Rival oil group BP is looking for sales of $1bn a year by 2007 from its solar business. Many of the new generation of firms offering alternative energy equipment are still losing money. Like internet stocks before them, share prices have surged forward on the promise of future riches following hefty investment programmes. A range of influences has fuelled a new boom in the City reflected in a rash of research notes published by leading banks. One from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney runs to 450 pages and recommends London-quoted stocks such as Johnson Matthey and Morgan Crucible. Driving force The bank cites the government's willingness to push \"green/clean\" fuels as the main driver for the sector's growth. \"Recent headlines have been dominated by the Kyoto protocol and the US decision not to sign up to it. However, we do not feel that this will prove detrimental for 'clean' power,\" says SSSB. \"Specific legislation exists to encourage certain types of cleaner power in the US, as well as further legislation on a state by state basis. In Europe, the EU specifies targets for renewable generation of electricity as a percentage of each country's power generation.\" Governments' reasons for pushing forward the case for green fuels are clear. Soaring oil prices, the California energy crisis and traffic congestion in the developed and developing world have seen legislators keen to take action. In Denmark, the government pumps $300m a year into supporting wind power - which now generates 8% of all the county's electricity. Indonesia has installed more than 30,000 photovoltaic grids - essentially solar power systems - in rural areas. Iceland has promised to switch its buses, cars and boats to hydrogen power in 40 years. Worries over energy supply have also boosted the \"distributed power\" sector of small-scale generating plants using both traditional and alternativefuels. The sectors go hand in hand. Wind and solar powers lead the field as the most \"green\" fuel sources with no harmful emissions, but microturbines and others in the distributed power area also promise the opportunity to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through more efficient energy use. Here, the driving force behind the push for cheaper ways to produce electricity is the needs of the world's ever-expanding population and the rise of technology which will see the electrification of homes and businesses. These two factors are alone expected to increase overall demand for power generating equipment by 5% a year over the next decade. Another reason for the interest in microturbines is that the world's ageing power stations - many of which are coal burning - need to be replaced at a time when ever tighter environmental regulations are being passed. Investment message Whatever the reasons for the projected growth - SSSB says the wind power market should expand by 20% a year and solar power \"is set to grow very strongly from a current small base\" - it is a message that investors are keen to hear. Mark Fielding, a co-author of the SSSB report, said: \"We have had to mail out an extra 800 copies on top of our normal print run.\" All this means that cash is now being poured into the environment-friendly energy market. \"Alternative energy is one of the biggest areas we are investing in at the moment,\" says Guy de Blonay, a fund manager with Jupiter Asset Management. How they stack up Wind power Wind turbines convert the force of air movement into a power source but they grind to a halt on calm days. They are the grandfathers of renewable energy given that windmills have been around for centuries. But the first electricity-generating turbine was built in 1891 by meteorologist Pul la Cour. Interest was weak until the first oil price crisis, of 1973. The past 30 years have been spent trying to reduce the cost which has made much wind power prohibitive.There has been some local opposition to wind farms being developed on land because of the noise and visual impact. Solar power Solar energy is the \"clean\" source of power based on harnessing the sun for generating electricity. Light is converted into power via a photovoltaic cell, or solar cell. The effect was discovered by physicist Edmund Becquerel in 1839 but built on by scientists at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s who produced 4% efficiency. Modern laboratories can produce 25% efficiency. Solar panels were extensively used in space programmes and are now commonly put on rooftops although costs remain uncompetitive. Global solar cell production rose by 43% last year as big oil firms and industrial companies worked to improve the economics. Fuel cells Fuel cells produce cleaner and fairly reliable power through the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. Although theoretically the cells could be run from the atmosphere, the leader in the field, Ballard Power, and the car companies prefer to drive hydrogen from methanol - which would come from petrol. The first commercial products are likely to reach the market this year with fuel cell-powered cars to come in 2004, but cost remains an issue. Microturbines A small jet engine with an electrical generator attached to the shaft. They evolved from the gas turbine and emit low levels of pollutants. Firms such as Capstone Turbines have been offering commercial products since late 1998 but they will become more economic for manufacturers with mass production, which is now planned. Microturbines are regarded as reliable and could be paired with a fuel cell for back-up systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2001/sep/02/gardens","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2001-09-02T10:38:50Z","webTitle":"Give it some welly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/sep/02/gardens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2001/sep/02/gardens","fields":{"headline":"Give it some welly","bodyText":"The children go back to school this week. New term, new academic year. Itchy winter clothes. It is a new term for me, too. All change. For the past three years, I have been wholly absorbed in a flurry of television work and what tends to be the scramble of journalism. I have no regrets about this. But it does at times feel like endlessly going round a track, jumping hurdles. Keep the rhythm and think of nothing else and it goes fine. Notice something out of the corner of your eye and all the hurdles come crashing down. And it is time that I noticed this garden a bit more. Anyone who reads this column regularly will have endured my constant whinge over the past year of not having enough time actually out in the garden. I have also not had time to sit and think, research and write slowly. I have been doing a lot and impressing people with my ceaseless industry without adding much to the body of knowledge and experience that gives that activity substance. Time to pause. So, I have signed up to do a book trying to synthesise and explain the whole organic approach to gardening and domestic life and we will illustrate it by photographing a year in this garden. In fact, we began a few weeks ago. Obviously this means that I must have some gardening as well as some domesticity. Or even a life. To this end, I shall do nothing for the coming six months or so but this column and work on the book. Part of that remit means working a part of every day outside. I wish I was writing these words in February, but nevertheless it is a thrilling prospect. I really believe that the whole bundle of issues that are wrapped up in the organic movement can change the world. It has become a central political issue and yet remains the active property of everyone at the most mundane domestic level - whether in your garden, allotment or even window box. In that light, the approach to gardening that has been dominant over the past 50 years - as an escape from the outside world, obsessed with trying to grow the ungrowable - seems irrelevant. Until fairly recently, I would have considered this absurdly abstract, but it is fascinating how political activity seems to have become displaced from parliament to the domestic lives of otherwise unpoliticised people. Which includes me. I have no allegiance to any political party and a profound mistrust and disrespect for all politicians, yet I feel sufficiently angry and motivated to want to put things to rights. And I intend to start in the garden. So, now is the time to take stock. The life must be lived as well as preached. I suspect that the publishers thought that they could tap into the flag-waving organic element of this garden as self-publicised here and in various other media, but I need to be more critical than that. Is it a question of simply not doing things? Of not using pesticides, fungicides, insecticides or herbicides? Of not using slug pellets or artificial fertilisers? Of not using peat? Nope. That is too easy and becomes little more than an indulgent act of self-denial fretted with convenient loopholes of the sort familiar to those holier-than-thou fish-eating vegetarians of the world. Not doing does set up a chain of actions and reactions. You don't use fungicides so when - as inevitably you will - you get fungal diseases, then you have to deal with them. You don't spray with weedkiller, so the weeds grow. This is all important and interesting and certainly needs dealing with, but not doing is not enough. You have to be more proactive than that. The key words are 'sustainable' and 'integrated'. The garden has to become integrated with your household and your life as a balanced, living whole. This is the antithesis of the conventional garden, which has nearly always been dominated by a single person fighting to make and maintain a garden despite the elements, predators and the outrageous intrusion of the natural world - and often, especially if they were men, despite their domestic life. The fight meant bringing in all the weapons available from the pharmaceutical army, otherwise the whole edifice would subside into anarchy. The garden establishment put its full corpulent weight behind this approach with the RHS, BBC and a battalion of booted-and-bouffanted matriarchs from the Home Counties supporting it. But like the Tory party, it is unsustainable, unlovable and completely missing the point. On the other hand, I have often felt that the organic movement is a bit like New Labour - it starts from the right place but is preachy, boring and profoundly unsexy. Any long-term change in the way that we treat this planet has to come from individual households that are wholly diverse and unorchestrated. The changes have to be, er, organic. The model is Genoa, the internet and Gaia, rather than a political party. Running a sustainable organic garden is actually becoming easier and easier. Five years ago, it was hard to buy a good range of organic seeds or organically produced plants. You still might have to shop around, but it is possible. Peat-free compost is still too expensive but it is in every garden centre. More and more councils are providing community composting. Concepts such as solar energy, wind energy, insulation and recycling water are now mainstream, even if they are still rarely put into practice. I have set the following tasks for myself over the coming year to try to up the ante of our organic life. Some of them are unambitious and merely tighten up observance of what I want to be doing already. Others are to push the integrated concept of an organic life a bit further. • To buy no food with GM content and no non-organically produced food where there is a choice. This latter condition seems a bit of a get-out, but if everyone did it then the knock-on effect would be huge. • To be as self-sufficient as possible in vegetables and fruit that we can grow well. I remember a time in the 70s when self-sufficiency was in vogue as a voyeuristic form of entertainment, but was always doomed to failure in any real world. The important thing is to make the most of what you can reasonably do. This will mean looking at existing forms of storing our various harvests. • To collect as much of our own seed as possible. We have done this in the past much more with flowers than food, but in a very haphazard fashion. Most of us hardly bother with this now, but it does seem barmy to buy seed when it is being produced for nothing in the garden. • To maintain as high an aesthetic and sensuous level of the garden as possible. In other words, not to disappear up my own backside in the flurry of being organically worthy. Sustainable gardening is not just about growing cabbages and carrots. The flowers, lawns and hedges are just as important. • To make a good pond, lined not with a liner but sealed with puddled clay. This is partly to see if I can do it well, but also to attract more insect and amphibian life to the garden and to keep ducks. • To work on ways of producing more compost by recycling everything possible, and to make intelligent use of green manure. • To look hard at energy use in the garden. This means harnessing sun and wind if possible, and seeing how we can minimise oil consumption while still balancing a modicum of modern sense. I don't want to pretend to be living in 1900. • To keep the garden genuinely healthy. On the whole this is the case, but we have had some real fungal problems by late summer for the past three years and have suffered from the wet in winter. I want to prove to myself (and you, dear potential readers) that an organic garden can be healthier - and look it - than one kept alive with a pharmacy of lotions and potions. • To notice everything, to be fully aware and alive in every season and in all weathers. • To pick some flowers every day, and to enjoy myself. My roots Any image of this garden as an all-singing, all-dancing health zone was blown apart in mid-August by the appearance of potato blight. One day, the potatoes were a mass of healthy foliage above ground and steadily maturing tubers below. By the next, half were dotted with telltale blotches and an area in the middle of the crop had collapsed into yellow-brown failure. Our relationship with the potato crop is dominated by blight - the fungus Phytophthora infestaris. It seems to be endemic around here, living in the soil. According to the RHS Book of Pests and Diseases (Dorling Kindersley) for the fungus to develop it must have two consecutive 24-hour periods with a minimum temperature of 10 C and 12 hours of 90 per cent humidity - warm wet. By July, it is always warm enough and, sooner or later, it is always going to be wet enough. All we can do is to cut off the tops, blast the area with a flame-thrower (good fun) to try to burn off the spores that are on the ground before they go down into the soil and reach the potatoes themselves. If they do, the roots rot and the crop is lost. This year, I watched it for a week or so, whereas in previous years I would have treated it like cholera and acted as soon as I saw it. Last year, I composted the infected haulms and have done so again, whereas I used to think that everything had to be burned. Apparently the fungal spores will not live in heat of above 50 C, which any self-respecting compost heap should reach. The secret for the organic gardener is to grow 'first earlies' ie, new potatoes that mature early (around midsummer) before blight occurs, to get them in the ground as early as possible and to choose varieties that are known to be somewhat blight-resistant - such as the 'Sante' or 'Romano' that I have this year and which nevertheless have got the fungus. But this is no disaster so long as something is salvageable. The biggest worry is that the potato blight will spread to the tomatoes. In previous years, I have sprayed with Bordeaux mixture, but this coats the tomatoes with a white powdery film which is unappetising. As the fungus is airborne, one way to prevent it is to close the doors in the tunnel, but this creates a humid atmosphere that will make the fungus develop particularly well if it does get in. So I keep the doors open, reduce watering to a minimum, and hope. Observer offer Readers can order six environmentally friendly slug traps for £9.95, incl UK p&amp;p, or a dozen for £16.90.

The idea has held powerful sway during 30 years of popular thinking - despite the fact that it has been clearly shown to be incorrect. Scare stories of resource depletion still turn up in the media every so often, but many environmentalists today have disavowed their earlier fears. For many people, the 1973 oil crisis was the first evidence of finite resources. But we have long worried about running out of all kinds of materials: in antiquity, grave concerns were voiced about the future of copper and tin. The 1972 bestseller Limits to Growth, by the so-called Club of Rome, picked up on the old worry, claiming that gold would run out in 1981, silver and mercury in 1985, and zinc in 1990. It hasn't happened, and yet the idea held an almost magical grip on intellectuals in the 70s and 80s; and even today most discussions are predicated on the logic of Limits to Growth. Only the economists begged to differ. One of them, Julian Simon, grew so frustrated that in 1980 he issued a challenge to the environmentalists. Since increased scarcity would mean higher prices, he bet $10,000 that any given raw material - to be picked by his opponents - would have dropped in price at least one year later. Stanford University environmentalists Paul Ehrlich, John Harte and John Holdren, stating that \"the lure of easy money can be irresistible\", took him on. The environmentalists put their money on chromium, copper, nickel, tin and tungsten, and they picked a time frame of 10 years. By September 1990, each of the raw materials had dropped in price: chromium by 5%, tin by a whopping 74%. The doom-mongers had lost. The truth is that they could not have won. Ehrlich and co would have lost, whatever they had bet on: petroleum, foodstuffs, sugar, coffee, cotton, wool, minerals, phosphates - they had all become cheaper. Today, oil is the most important and most valuable commodity of international trade, and its value to our civilisation is underlined by the recurrent worry that we are running out of it. In 1914, the US Bureau of Mines estimated that supplies would last only 10 more years. In 1939, the US department of the interior predicted that oil would last only 13 more years. In 1951, it made the same projection: oil had only 13 more years. As Professor Frank Notestein of Princeton said in his later years: \"We've been running out of oil ever since I was a boy.\" Again, measuring scarcity means looking at the price. Even if we were to run out of oil, this would not mean that oil was completely unavailable, only that it would be very, very expensive. The oil-price hike from 1973 to the mid-80s was caused by an artificial scarcity, as Opec introduced production restraints. Likewise, the present high price is caused by adherence to Opec-agreed production cutbacks in the late 90s. It is expected that the price will again decline from $27 a barrel to the low $20s by 2020, bringing it well within the $17-$30 suggested by eight other recent international forecasts. The long-term trend is unlikely to deviate much from these levels because high prices deter consumption and encourage the development of other sources of oil - and forms of energy supply. Likewise, low prices have the opposite effect. In fact, the price of petrol at US pumps, excluding tax, stood at $1.10 in early 2001 - comparable with the lowest prices before the oil crisis. This is because most of the price consists of the costs of refining and transportation, both of which have experienced huge efficiency increases. At the same time, we have had an ever-rising prediction of the number of years' worth of oil remaining (years of consumption), despite increasing consumption. This is astounding. Common sense dictates that if we had 35 years' consumption left in 1955, we should have had 34 years' supply left the year after - if not less, because we consumed more oil in 1956 than in 1955. But the chart shows that in 1956 there were more years of reserves available. The development for non-fuel resources has been similar. Cement, aluminium, iron, copper, gold, nitrogen and zinc account for more than 75% of global expenditure on raw materials. Despite a two- to 10-fold increase in consumption of these materials over the past 50 years, estimates of the number of years it will take to run out of them have grown. And the increasing abundance is reflected in price: the Economist's price index for raw materials has dropped by 80% since 1845. So how can we have used ever more, and still have ever more left? The answers provide three central arguments against the limited resources approach: 1. \"Known resources\" is not a finite entity. It is not that we know all the places with oil, and now just need to pump it up. We explore new areas and find new oil. But since searching costs money, new searches will not be initiated too far in advance of production. Consequently, new oil fields will be added as demand rises. It is rather odd that anyone could have thought that known resources pretty much represented what was left, and therefore predicted dire problems when these had run out. It is like glancing into my refrigerator and saying: \"Oh, you've only got food for three days. In four days you will die of starvation.\" But in two days I will go to the supermarket and buy more food. The point is that oil will come not only from the sources we already know, but also from many sources of which we do not yet know. The US Geological Survey has regularly made assessments of the total undiscovered resources of oil and gas, and stated in March 2000: \"Since 1981, each of the last four of these assessments has shown a slight increase in the combined volume of identified reserves and undiscovered resources.\" 2. We become better at exploiting resources. We use new technology to extract more oil from known oilfields, become better at finding new oilfields, and can start exploiting oilfields that were previously too expensive and/or difficult to exploit. An initial drilling typically exploits only 20% of the oil in the reservoir. Even with the most advanced techniques using water, steam or chemical flooding to squeeze out extra oil, more than half the resource commonly remains in the ground. It is estimated that the 10 largest oilfields in the US will still contain 63% of their original oil when production closes down. Consequently, there is still much to be reaped in this area. According to the latest US Geological Survey assessment, such technical improvements are expected to increase the amount of available oil by 50%. At the same time, we have become better at exploiting each litre of oil. Since 1973, the average US car has improved its mpg by 60%. Home heating in Europe and the US has improved by 24-43%. Many appliances have become much more efficient - dishwashers and washing machines have cut energy use by about 50%. Most nations now exploit energy with increasing efficiency: we use less and less energy to produce each dollar, euro or yen in our gross national products. Since 1880, the UK has almost tripled its production per energy use; worldwide, the amount of wealth produced per energy unit doubled between 1971 and 1992. We also exploit other raw materials better: today, a car contains only half as much metal as a car produced in 1970. Super-thin optical fibres carry the same number of telephone calls as 625 copper wires did 20 years ago. Newspapers are printed on ever-thinner paper, because paper production has been improved. Bridges contain less steel, because steel has become stronger and because we can calculate specifications more accurately. Moreover, information technology has changed our consumption - we buy fewer things and more bits. Programs worth several hundred dollars will fit on a CD-rom made from two cents' worth of plastic. 3. We can substitute. We do not demand oil as such, but rather the services it can provide. Mostly we want heating, energy or fuel, and this we can obtain from other sources, if they prove to be better or cheaper. This happened in England around 1600 when wood became increasingly expensive (because of local deforestation and bad infrastructure), prompting a gradual switch to coal. During the latter part of the 19th century, a similar move from coal to oil took place. In the short run, it would be most obvious to substitute oil with other commonly known fossil fuels such as gas and coal. For both, estimates of the number of years' supply remaining have increased. Moreover, shale oil could cover a large part of our longer-term oil needs. At $40 a barrel (less than one-third above the current world price of crude), shale oil can supply oil for the next 250 years at current consumption; in total, there is enough shale oil to cover our total energy consumption for 5,000 years. In the long run, renewable energy sources could cover a large part of our needs. Today, they make up a vanishingly small part of global energy production, but this will probably change. The cost of solar energy and wind energy has dropped by 94-98% over the past 20 years, and have come much closer to being strictly profitable. Renewable energy resources are almost incomprehensibly large. The sun could potentially provide about 7,000 times our own energy consumption - in principle, covering just 2.6% of the Sahara desert with solar cells could supply our entire needs. It is likely that we will eventually change our energy uses from fossil fuels towards other, cheaper energy sources - maybe renewables, maybe fusion, maybe some as yet unthought-of technology. As Sheikh Yamani, Saudi Arabia's former oil minister and a founding architect of Opec, has pointed out: \"The stone age came to an end not for a lack of stones, and the oil age will end, but not for a lack of oil.\" We stopped using stone because bronze and iron were superior materials; likewise, we will stop using oil when other energy technologies provide superior benefits. • To order a copy of The Skeptical Environmentalist by Bjorn Lomborg (Cambridge University Press, £17.95), for £15.95, plus p&amp;p, call Guardian CultureShop on 0870 066 7979.

He had his throne carried to the beach, sat down facing the sea, and commanded the waves to stop. The tide hissed in over the sands, regardless, and foamed around the monarch's feet. \"Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings,\" Canute is supposed to have told his chastened lackeys. A thousand years later, the Danes' grasp of nature's realities still has Britain foxed. While the nuclear and fossil fuel lobbies, Thatcherite politicians and the rightwing media were sneering at the crackpot idea of electricity being generated commercially from the wind, Denmark got on with making it happen. The outcome is a brutal lesson in the wisdom of perseverance. Electricity can be got from the latest generation of wind turbines as cheaply as from gas, and more cheaply than from coal or nuclear power. The world is queuing up to buy them - from Denmark. Danish firms control more than half a global market worth £2.5bn. The Danish wind energy industry employs more people than the British coal industry. Since 1999, more new wind electricity generation has been built each year than nuclear. In a powerful symbol of the age, 325 Danish turbines are to be placed in a vast wind farm on the site of the old Nevada nuclear weapons test site. World leaders will gather in Bonn this week for critical talks on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But their abstruse talk of \"carbon sinks\" (forests to absorb excess carbon from the air) and \"emissions trading\" (where polluting countries buy the right to pollute from countries who pollute less) will not be enough to safeguard our futures. The majority consensus among scientists is that without a sharp cut in carbon dioxide emissions from coal, oil and gas, average global temperatures will rise by almost 6C within the lifetimes of babies born today. The now familiar sight in Britain of dark, gigantic blades cutting through the horizon - like demented bowlers forever fixed to their crease - is a small sign of hope for the world. Every kilowatt of electricity they produce means less carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. It's also a great sign for the Danish economy. Almost all of the hundreds of wind turbines being installed in the UK, such as the twin giants, 90 metres high, now whirling on metal columns off the coast of Northumberland at Blyth, are Danish. Demand in Britain is so great that the firm that makes them, Vestas, is building a factory near an old Nato base in Scotland to assemble turbines. It means 120 local jobs, but the technology is Denmark's. Quite how a wealthy, technologically advanced, environmentally conscious nation - which also happens to be one of the windiest places in Europe - lost out to little Denmark in the way it has lost out to Japan, Germany, France and the US in commercialising so many areas of science and engineering is a puzzle whose solution says much about the nature of Britain. Even stranger is that history may be about to repeat itself. A still more attractive renewable energy source for our storm-girded islands - the waves and the tides - is about to be realised. Once again, Denmark could beat us to commercialising the technology. A millennium on from Canute, it seems, we may not have acquired the wisdom of the Danes. Each year Britain consumes the energy equivalent of about 230m tons of oil - roughly four tons per person. Just over a third of that is in the form of electricity, mostly from gas, coal, oil and uranium; a tiny fraction of that third is renewable energy, mainly hydro power and wind. The rest is spent forever. As North Sea reserves dry up, Britain is doomed to become a net importer of oil. Competition and the dash for gas has brought electricity prices down in the short term, but no less conservative an outfit than the ministry of defence has predicted that by 2020, Britain could be importing 90% of the gas it needs, mainly from Russia, Algeria and Iran. Without wind, wave, tidal and photovoltaic energy generation, the only alternatives to energy dependence on illiberal states are coal and nuclear - each, in their own way, likely to prove too dirty and expensive to be of much help, despite talk of a nuclear revival. Now, as if the twin threats of climate change and energy dependence weren't enough, the Danes have shown a third reason for backing renewables: jobs and money. The very skills that are strongest in some of Britain's most employment-hungry areas - shipbuilding, offshore engineering, diving, seafaring - would be the skills needed to make wave and tidal energy work. \"I was standing at Southampton the other day, looking out to sea,\" says Peter Fraenkel. \"It's one of the most heavily used areas of water around our coast, but there were only 30 or 40 boats there, occupying a minute part of the sea area. I looked back at the land; thousands of buildings, roads, people. With a bit of imagination you can see that even the busiest stretches of sea are mainly huge empty spaces. To my mind, there's no real, physical reason why you couldn't get a very large proportion of the country's energy out of them.\" Fraenkel heads a company based in Hampshire called Marine Current Turbines. It is about to build the first full-scale prototype of a device to draw energy from the water, generated by the ebb and flow of the tides. Designed to be installed in rows offshore, it is, essentially, an underwater windmill. Compared to the technology used for offshore oil platforms, it's laughably simple: a steel column, planted on the seabed and sticking out above the surface, with a three-blade propellor mounted underwater, attached to a turbine inside the column. As the tidal currents flow past, the propellor turns, generating electricity. Simple - but the tidal currents on the Pentland Firth alone, between Orkney and the mainland, could generate 5-6,000 megawatts of power using these devices, the output of six nuclear stations. With many other potential sites - including Devon, Anglesey, the North Channel between Ulster and Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Isle of Wight - tidal energy could provide a fifth of Britain's electricity. \"The beauty of the tides is that they are absolutely predictable, hundreds of years in advance,\" says Fraenkel. \"As long as the moon sticks to its schedule.\" He now looks set to get government funding. Whether it will come in time to make up for decades of neglect in wave and tidal energy research remains to be seen. \"A few years ago, funding for renewables had sunk to £8m,\" says Fraenkel. \"The government of John Major thought that anything that could be invented had been invented. Now suddenly this government has thrown a huge amount of money into it but you can't reverse things overnight. Money alone won't do it.\" In Scotland, the focus of much of Britain's research into marine energy and the location of its stormiest seas, there is a similar air of sudden urgency. Orkney and the Western Isles have been plunged into a bitter lobbying battle to be the site for a wave and tidal energy proving centre, but Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), the backers of the centre, are aware that the true competition for jobs and technology is between them and countries like Denmark, Portugal and Ireland. \"We've had a strong signal from industry that we need to do something dead quickly, because if we don't, they're going to go elsewhere,\" says Elaine Hanton of HIE. British governments have traditionally taken an approach to backing new inventions known to entrepreneurs as \"technology push\". They pour research and development money into lavish development of new technology for a short time, then sit back and wait for the market to make it commercially viable. Nothing happens; the government cuts off funding in disgust. That's more or less what happened to Britain's abortive wind and wave programmes in the 1970s and 80s. The Danes found another way, called \"market pull\". Instead of hosing cash at scientists and engineers, they gave financial incentives to investors to put money into wind turbines at a time when wind energy was not commercially viable. As a result, the Danes gained the experience and economies of scale needed to bring the costs down - and, in the process, 150,000 Danish families acquired ownership or part-ownership of a wind turbine. Richard Yemm, of the Edinburgh-based wave energy company Ocean Power Delivery, says: \"The UK was the leader in wind technology, but because there was no market for the technology, there were never any companies installing large numbers of machines and learning from that.\" Yemm's company has designed a device called Pelamis, a snake-like device, 150 metres long, with hydraulic joints, designed to be tethered to the sea bed, head-on to incoming waves. In gentle seas, it will undulate over the crests of the waves, generating electricity from the motion; in rougher weather, it will drive head-first through the waves to avoid being shaken to pieces. If it can be shown to work - the prototype has yet to be built - a \"wave farm\" of 40 devices could provide enough electricity for about 15,000 homes. But Yemm's point is that no matter how well Pelamis works, and no matter how much money the government gives to help make it work, the first wave farms will never be built unless the government weaves a sophisticated web of subsidies to entice the first investors into the water. It was Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, the self-conscious model of patriotic, rural, northern English bluff common sense, who spearheaded the campaign against wind turbines in the 90s, calling them ugly, inefficient, uneconomic and trivial. Some still argue the first point, but the Danes have proved him wrong on the others, and Britain's marine energy entrepreneurs are not beyond striking a patriotic note of their own. \"Wind is sewn up, and solar energy is not looking that promising in the UK as yet, but there's all this spare tidal energy just slopping around,\" says John Hassard, of the British tidal energy startup RVco. \"If we could get our act together, we could really rule the waves again, couldn't we?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/apr/06/bp","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-06T10:29:08Z","webTitle":"Pirc backs green plan to force BP out of Alaska","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/apr/06/bp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/apr/06/bp","fields":{"headline":"Pirc backs green plan to force BP out of Alaska","bodyText":"Pirc, the corporate governance watchdog, has thrown its weight behind a controversial attempt by Greenpeace to make BP Amoco withdraw from Alaska. In a report sent out to fund managers yesterday, Pirc urged its clients to vote for a Greenpeace resolution demanding that the oil group redirects investment towards renewable energy sources. The move could trigger an embarassing show of dissent at BP's annual general meeting later this month - Pirc believes its clients own between 3% and 5% of the company. Pirc director Alan MacDougall said: \"We don't think BP has a strategy to deal with the transition away from carbon.\" Greenpeace's resolution calls on BP Amoco to cancel all plans for oil exploration around the Arctic region. This would mean abandoning the company's half-complete $700m (£450m) Northstar project, which involves the construction of an artificial island off the Alaskan coast. The resolution argues that the money should go towards enlarging BP Solarex - a scheme aimed at producing solar energy. In a highly critical report, Pirc says BP is taking too little action to address the long-term shift away from fossil fuels, which cause global warming: \"We regard the company's approach at present as too passive and would consider it more appropriate for it to show stronger leadership.\" BP, which has gained praise for its statements on the environment in recent years, argues that there is insufficient demand to justify more investment in solar energy. However, Pirc says: \"A company with the resources and scale of BP Amoco can play an important role in creating the conditions for increased demand.\" It says demand could be generated \"through lobbying, marketing and promotional activity as well as through investing in research and development and production\". Pirc admitted there would be a \"short-term cost\" associated with this strategy but said there would be \"compensatory gains\" for shareholders in positioning BP Amoco to take advantage of the future market for renewable energy. Pirc's clients include many of the City's biggest pension funds, managing investments of more than £250bn. The organisation provides analysis of companies' approaches to executive pay, boardroom appointments and environmental policy. Mr MacDougall admitted there was no chance of Greenpeace's resolution being carried but said support of at least 5% would \"send a strong message and provide a basis for ongoing dialogue with the company\". BP Amoco rejected Pirc's analysis - a spokesman said the company was \"moving as fast as is practical and sensible\" towards renewable energy. The company has commited itself to increasing the size of its solar business ten-fold by 2007, making it a $1,000bn enterprise. The spokesman added: \"it is Pirc's prerogative to advise their clients on how they think their shares should be used.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2001/mar/18/theobserver.observerbusiness16","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2001-03-18T03:41:10Z","webTitle":"The poor are consumers, too","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/mar/18/theobserver.observerbusiness16","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2001/mar/18/theobserver.observerbusiness16","fields":{"headline":"The poor are consumers, too","bodyText":"The ground-breaking announcement last week by Bristol-Myers Squibb that it will cut the price of its Aids drugs in Africa from $20 a day to a below-cost price of less than $1 was an act of philanthropy - and good PR in a media climate that has turned sharply against the global drugs giants. But Bristol-Myers Squibb's move, which will transform its products from a niche market to a need market for the millions of people who could never have afforded them before, highlights the way in which forward-thinking multinational companies (MNCs) are now targeting the 4 billion people, two-thirds of the Earth's population, who have until now been written off in terms of market potential. Stuart Hart, director of the Sustainable Enterprise Initiative at the University of North Carolina, says it is not surprising that companies have traditionally overlooked the rural poor - what he calls the 'bottom of the pyramid' - as a fertile market. 'The bottom of the pyramid is chaotic and almost totally lacking in infrastructure. Not only that, to buy products and services - one must have money - and these people have little.' He defines the bottom of the pyramid as people with per capita incomes of less than $1,500 a year. But companies are beginning to dip their toes into these turbid waters. Shell Solar, in a joint venture with South Africa's national power company, Eskom, is bringing affordable solar power to the impoverished and isolated communities of the Eastern Cape for the first time, and with it the first social development many of them have ever experienced. But this is a strictly for-profit business. Shell Solar also operates in Sri Lanka, India, and the Philippines, and has ambitions to break into the mass markets of China and Indonesia. Dupont, Unilever, Hewlett-Packard and Johnson &amp; Johnson have also recently been experimenting with rural poor markets. Hart predicts that in five years' time this toe-dipping will develop into a substantial element of companies' global strategy. 'It's clear to many multinationals that if they are to grow and prosper in the future there isn't growth potential at the top of the pyramid,' he said in an interview. 'It's also increasingly evident, as a result of the pushback against globalisation, that the traditional business model won't be acceptable in the future.' Unlike with newly industrialising markets such as Malaysia or Thailand, where MNCs could make small adjustments to the business models they use in Europe or North America before jumping in with both feet, reaching the rural poor involves throwing out the rulebook and rewriting it on the ground - often in close partnership with local companies or non-governmental organisations. The MNC furthest along this track is Unilever which, under the chairmanship of Niall FitzGerald, has espoused a multi-local, multinational approach across all its operations. Nowhere has this worked more successfully than in India, where its subsidiary Hindustan Lever is, as FitzGerald says, 'totally integrated into Indian society and dedicated to meeting the specific needs of millions of Indian consumers'. It wasn't always thus. For 50 years, like most multinationals in India, Hindustan Lever catered to India's elite. But when a low-end local company, Nirma, began to threaten Hindustan Lever's detergents business from below, it had to drastically rewrite its business plan. In order to offer a cheaper product, in small individual packaging, through the thousand tiny outlets where poor people shop, it had to decentralise its production, marketing and distribution to take advantage of India's abundant labour pool and change its cost structure. Its margins were lower, but this was more than compensated for by soaring unit sales. For a rupee or two, Indians can now buy shampoo in single sachets, handcream in pots the size of a thimble and toothpaste in small disposable sachets. Single rupee sachets comprise about 70 per cent of the company's shampoo sales. It's a business model that Unilever was able to replicate when the Asian economic crisis brought hardship to the newly industrialising south-east Asian countries. 'When South East Asia was hitting economic difficulties, we were able to adapt by tailor-making smaller-quantity products for those markets, says a Unilever spokesman. 'We came out the other side of the crisis stronger.' One of the reasons why the very poor are becoming a market is that more and more now have access to credit. Microcredit, the lending by banks of tiny sums to the poor, is catching on all over the world, particularly in the sub-continent. An estimated 2 million families in India have access to financial services, and the Indian government has pledged to reach 25 million families by 2005. In Bangladesh, Grameen Bank, the oldest and most successful microcredit institution, with 2.5 million borrowers, has spun off into a host of other enterprises providing services to the poor, including GrameenPhone, which is 51 per cent owned by Telenor Invest AS of Norway and aims to finance a network of mobile phones in 68,000 rural villages. Damien Miller, Shell Solar's business manager for India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, says partnership with a micro-credit organisation is a prerequisite to entering a market, for it is only through credit that someone earning $1,000-$2,000 a year can afford the $500 energy system. 'There has to be capacity to pay. You can get to a lot of paddy farmers who can give a down payment of 20 per cent and pay the rest over five years.' But isn't there a risk of people taking on debt they cannot sustain? In Sri Lanka, he says, the repayment rate is 95 per cent. More importantly, solar panels are a good investment for customers, who would otherwise use kerosene or rechargeable batteries for electricity. Economic payback ranges from two to five years - compared with a 20-year payback in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, where solar energy remains a niche market. 'There [in the West] they are doing it for environmental reasons,' says Miller. 'In developing countries it's a need market. They really need your product.' But not all companies operate so responsibly. One has only to look at Nestlé, which pedalled its dried baby milk formula to Third World mothers who had no access to clean drinking water as the 'healthy' alternative to breast milk, to see what harm can be done by irresponsible corporate behaviour. Hart acknowledges the risk of exploitation, but says that with the rise of the internet and the global power of pressure groups, companies won't get away with socially irresponsible behaviour for long. 'I'm sure there will be plenty of mistakes, but I'm also confident they'll be ferreted out quickly. Increasingly we live in a fishbowl.' Hart instead sees the developing world as an incubator for sustainable technologies of the future - providing an early market 'pull' for ideas that will one day replace entrenched but ultimately unsustainable technologies in Europe and North America, such as fossil fuels. He points to micropower technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines and solar power, which have found early markets in places such as India. Some villages in Africa will soon have access to solar powered multi-media modems that will be enable them to access the internet. 'This extends far beyond good PR and corporate social responsibility,' he says. 'MNCs are acting from enlightened self-interest.' terry.slavin@observer.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2000/jun/15/technology1","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2000-06-15T00:56:26Z","webTitle":"Science update","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jun/15/technology1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2000/jun/15/technology1","fields":{"headline":"Science update","bodyText":"Branch line to safer forests When you save a forest from the woodman's axe, who benefits?

Surely solar power is the most intermittent source there is, being unavailable just when you most need it - on a cold winter's night. The two ecologically-sound power sources are waves (almost always) and the tides (unstoppable), both of which we have in abundance in the UK. Both of these can be harnessed in environmentally-friendly ways, including the necessary element of energy storage. However, if power is to be generated locally, then there is a good case for using solar power for air-conditioning, particularly in the tropics. It needs little more than an ammonia-cycle refrigerator, which is low-maintenance and non-polluting. Tim Gossling Cambridge • Wind farms are an important part of future energy generation. I agree that we need large-scale subsidisation and investment in solar power. However, being geographically challenged as we are in the UK, when we most need solar energy the sun is not shining. The current technology would be hard pushed to provide us all with sufficient heating in winter. Conversely, the wind resource is often largest in winter. If we are going to continue using energy at the current rate, we need to utilise the range of renewable resources at our disposal. Regarding the aesthetics of wind turbines, they should be judged within the context of their industrial counterparts. I personally believe they are rather beautiful compared to a nuclear or coal-fired power station. Ag Stephens Norwich • When we wanted to erect a turbine to provide power for our Welsh home in the Black Mountains, we were mortified at the distorted and malicious criticism levelled at us by a vocal faction in the valley. Luckily, we canvassed opinion locally and were delighted to find a large majority in favour of our turbine, and the planners gave their support too. In our case, a mains connection would have been too expensive. Our photovoltaic panels are of limited benefit, especially in winter (and at night), but linked to our new turbine they will help us make a small contribution to saving fossil fuel. The wind power output is indeed intermittent, like other natural forces, but certainly not pitiful nor pointless industrialisation. How about some positive thinking, you nimbys? Such hatred helps no one with an eye to global warming. Simon Marr-Johnson London A climate of blame While the rise in racist crime you report is disturbing (Forward march, November 22), I am concerned that you do not indicate whether there has been any increase in the incidence of racial harassment by individuals from the ethnic minority population on members of the indigenous one. I live in a borough where many of the indigenous population feel threatened by the growth of the ethnic minority community, and point to a significant number of assaults by ethnic minority youths on their indigenous peers as reported in the local press (which is a rising problem recognised by the local police). This is so much so that many in the indigenous community perceive areas of the borough where ethnic minorities are concentrated as \"no go\" areas, even though the reality does not bear this out. All racially-motivated crime is unacceptable and unforgivable, but while the tenor of reporting appears to lay the onus on the indigenous community only, it carries the danger of creating resentment among the indigenous community and unintentionally promoting resistance to the acceptance of living in a multicultural society. Jeremy Sutcliffe Oldham Charity checks As the author of the research into cancer charities at Manchester Business School, I would like to respond to Stuart Etherington's letter (November 22). By necessity, only the highlights of my 275-page research into the changes in the top 25 cancer charities in the period 1992-97, including the \"charitable efficiency\" ratio, have been publicised. The majority of feedback from the charities able to take time to listen to, and discuss, more than just the highlights has been that the research is a worthwhile contribution to the debate on the future of cancer charities. The level of reported cooperation between cancer charities formed part of my research and I would certainly agree with Etherington that all charities could do more to publicise how they work together. One of my main conclusions is that more cooperation would be beneficial to the patient. This would also reassure the public that the money they donate is being used to maximum impact, while minimising confusion over the proliferation of brands. We hope to organise a seminar to present the research to London-based cancer charities and representatives of umbrella organisations. If the National Council for Voluntary Organisations would be prepared to host such an event, I believe the benefits of joint working would continue to be seen, supported by more detailed research than appears to have previously been undertaken.

Chairman Sir John Browne said the new so-called sunburst label would be used to launch a range of new BP Connect convenience stores on all major petrol forecourts in an attempt to increase retail sales by more than 10% per annum. The BP Amoco name will be shortened to BP as the group moves to a single brand after the $120bn (£79bn) series of acquisitions over the last two years that took in Amoco, Arco and Burmah Castrol. The brand change has cost $7m and BP plans to spend a further $100m a year developing it. Sir John said BP would in future stand for \"beyond pe troleum\" rather than British Petroleum. Its 28,000 petrol stations around the world will be modernised over four years, but 3,000 jobs will be lost as overlapping BP and Amoco sites are shut down. Named the Helios mark after the Greek sun god, the new logo signifies dynamic energy in all its forms from oil to gas and solar, said Sir John. But he admitted it would allow BP to expand its brand into other retail areas beyond its traditional energy fields. The company will start with its general shops, which will sell everything from baked beans to washing powder. \"We are not an oil company. 40% of our hydrocarbon production comes from natural gas. We are aware the world wants less carbon-intensive fuels. What we want to do is create options,\" he explained. But the relaunch was met with cynicism by green cam paigners. Rob Gueterbock, a climate energy speciliast at Greenpeace, said the company's move was a triumph of style over substance. \"They spent more on the logo this year than they did on renewable energy last year. Given they spend $8bn a year on oil exploration, BP stands less for beyond petroleum and more for burning the planet,\" he said. The first of the new retail sites will be opened in London later this year. BP Connect stores will feature in-store e-kiosks where customers can check weather and traffic conditions, pay and call up directions to local destinations. While filling their tanks, motorists will be able to use a touch-screen monitor to order sandwiches, pastries and snacks. The screens will also be used to offer sports scores and latest news. BP also plans to underline its new renewable energy commitment by using solar energy to power the new sites, with panels forming the transparent canopy above the pumps. Sir John added: \"We expect the move to a global brand and introduction of state of the art retailing sites to bring a significant increase in sales.\" He said it was important to strengthen the sense of identity and common purpose of the company's 100,000 employees who work in more than 100 countries around the world. He added that BP was having no problem recruiting staff, despite falling unemployment levels in the United States and Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/apr/27/rover.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-27T00:34:33Z","webTitle":"Car workers are rightly doomed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/apr/27/rover.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/apr/27/rover.comment","fields":{"headline":"Car workers are rightly doomed","bodyText":"The workers of the West Midlands are the victims of decades of kindness.

Protecting car production in the face of market failure has, far from helping them, locked the people of the West Midlands into an economy which cannot sustain itself. British car plants are doomed not only because they are slow and inefficient and suffer from the economies of scale enjoyed by bigger plants elsewhere, but also because the European car market is close to saturation. Car manufacturing can continue to grow only if the people of this and other nations are prepared to suffer ever more intractable traffic jams. We are not. The workers of Longbridge are vulnerable, in other words, because their industry is both economically and environmentally unsustainable. The troubles at Longbridge are illustrative of a far wider problem. Instead of liberating \"the extraordinary talent of the British people . . . from the forces of conservatism that so long have held them back\", Tony Blair's government has systematically suppressed the future and subsidised the past. It has poured money only into those industries whose growth is limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. Since Labour came to power, for example, it has given BAe and Rolls-Royce a total of £850m to make aeroplanes, yet political pressure has been building up all over Europe to limit the number of flights and stop the construction of new airports. Releasing more cars and planes on to the market is likely, paradoxically, only to reduce our productivity. The CBI calculates, for example, that congestion is costing Britain £15bn a year. Swedish research shows that the reading ability of 12 to 14-year-olds living under flight paths is impaired by 23%. Figures published this week by the Global Commons Institute reveal that, while global GDP has risen by 3% a year over the past four decades, economic losses caused by natural disasters have risen annually by 10%. By 2065, it calculates, the cost of climate change will outstrip the value of the entire global economy. Technologies for which demand is booming, on the other hand, are being muzzled. As the economist Paul Ekins points out, the growth in environmental spending in the UK outperformed the rest of the economy by four times over the 90s. The global solar energy market is growing annually by 40%. Yet civil servants at the Department of Trade and Industry, captured by the oil and nuclear companies they are supposed to regulate, remain fiercely hostile towards the new technologies. Five times as much money is spent in British universities on research into oil and gas as on research into renewable power, even though oil and gas is a mature industry whose reserves are running out, while renewable energy is taking off. As a result, Shell has decided to build its solar energy plants not in Britain but in Germany, where the government has promised to install solar panels on 100,000 homes. The massive export market it is developing will create tens of thousands of jobs. Though Britain is the windiest nation in Europe, it has offered no challenge to Denmark's bid to become the global leader in wind technology. By 2030, wind will supply 40% of Denmark's electricity, while we will be left to struggle with growing power bills and massive unemployment as oil reserves dry up and we have to import our electricity from far-sighted nations. Indeed, while it continues to prop up such 19th-century technologies as internal combustion engines and coal mining, the government is permitting the only shipyard with the capacity to build giant offshore wind turbines (Harland and Wolff in Belfast) to go to the wall. The impending loss of thousands of jobs in the West Midlands is a great tragedy. It is also a great opportunity. Were the government to exercise a little of that vision it claims to possess in abundance, it would abandon the backward-looking policies which have compromised the future of British manufacturing and launch, instead, a genuine \"knowledge-based economy\". I fear, however, that the forces of conservatism are alive and well, sustained by the misguided philanthropy of the government which claims to despise them. comment@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jul/24/debtrelief.development","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-24T01:05:33Z","webTitle":"Leader: Okinawa was a talking and eating shop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/24/debtrelief.development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jul/24/debtrelief.development","fields":{"headline":"Disdain for the poor","bodyText":"If words could repay debts then the world summit in Okinawa would have been less of a shambles than it was. Failure to make any significant progress on debt reduction for developing countries, despite agreement a year ago, casts a dark shadow across the prospects for new initiatives agreed this year. The summit committed the US, Britain, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Russia to a 25% reduction in the number of HIV-infected young people by 2010 and a 50% reduction in tuberculosis and malarial deaths by the same time. The rich countries also promised to set up a task force to \"bridge the information and knowledge divide between the rich and the poor\". Noble aims - but what do they amount to beyond being aspirations without a delivery mechanism behind them and with the US Congressional axe poised over anything that costs money? The summiteers supported universal primary education for every child in the world by 2015. This is a vital need at a time when 100m children in developing countries are not in school at all. But willing the end doesn't will the means. The most indebted countries know this to their cost because barely $15bn of the $100bn that rich nations promised to forgive last year has actually been cancelled. Jubilee 2000, the anti-debt lobby, even scorned the G8 plan to bridge the digital divide on the grounds that providing basics such as housing, electricity and telephones were priorities before talking about computers. Well, maybe. One of the attractions of the information age is that laying down expensive infrastructure for telephones is no longer necessary because the wireless revolution means that information can be beamed down to basic computers (maybe powered by solar energy or even clockwork) with internet access without spending billions on land lines. This can enable parts of Africa which have barely experienced the fruits of the industrial revolution, to leapfrog over it into the internet age. Knowledge, freely available on the web, can help educate poor children in Africa and even contribute to improving farming technology and food production. But it won't be possible unless the poorest countries can escape from the scourge of debt and illiteracy. Unless something is done quickly, developing countries will fall even further behind. Most new jobs in the west require varying degrees of computer or keyboard skills. Poor people in the third world will increasingly miss out out on this kind of job while feeling the shock waves from US digital dominance which reinforced itself at the weekend when the summit fell in with an American corporate agenda to start new trade talks and to observe intellectual property rights. Developing countries could also suffer from lower prices for primary goods as electronic markets for basic products (like bananas) are established, aggravating the deflationary effects of the info-revolution. There is also evidence of investment being pulled from poor countries in pursuit of dot.com companies in the US and Europe. If the G8 is going to deal with these problems, rather than a more representative body like the UN, then it will have to reorganise drastically and provide itself with an effective delivery system. At the moment the annual summit is little more than an expensive talking shop. This year it cost an astonishing £500m, a sum big enough to have saved an entire African country. An organisation that spends that much on an event that ignores the desperate plight of the third world is dangerously out of touch with the real needs of the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2000/mar/06/guardianleaders1","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2000-03-06T02:08:47Z","webTitle":"The next oil crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/mar/06/guardianleaders1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/mar/06/guardianleaders1","fields":{"headline":"The next oil crisis","bodyText":"Surging oil prices - which could soon push the price of petrol to £4 a gallon - have come as an overdue reminder to industrialised countries of just how dependent their economies still are on a single source of energy. And, more to the point, how little they have done about it since the last energy crisis. It is ironic that just when the west is starting to feel confident that it has emerged from the hyper-inflationary effects of the last oil crisis more than 25 years ago, it could be faced with a new one. No one who lived through the consequences of the previous oil shock would want to see one again. Quite apart from electricity cuts and queues at the pumps, it was responsible for numerous, dire knock-on effects, including wages chasing prices in an upward spiral that triggered economic recession and price inflation of well over 20%. The world economy, though outwardly robust, could easily succumb to a stock market crash induced by the pricking of the internet share bubble. If oil prices continue to zoom, it will be doubly vulnerable. Yet what is the right price for oil? We all want it cheap at source (to stem inflation and prevent producers from making unearned fortunes), yet expensive at point of sale to discourage profligacy and provide revenues to support the welfare state. Even at $30 for a 27 gallon barrel - and transported half way round the earth - oil works out at only 6.5p a pint. Try buying mineral water at that price. If left to \"market forces\", with producers freely supplying the needs of consumers, oil would undoubtedly be much cheaper than $30 a barrel. But very cheap oil would be the economics of myopia. As recently found oilfields in the west run down - with no obvious new discoveries to replace them - we will become increasingly dependent on Opec countries as their share of the global market rises steadily above 50%. Russian oil and gas (the profits of which bankrolled the Chechnya war) will account for much of the rest. There have been too many false alarms in the past about the speed at which non-Opec reserves would be run down. This has spawned complacency. But in the longer term, there is no doubt that the balance of power will swing decisively to the east. What should be done? Two vital things, for a start. First, Opec must be politely reminded that it is a cartel and that abuses of power by a cartel (such as its current, artificially low production quotas) cannot be tolerated, especially in a world driven by free trade and globalisation. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, is expected later this year to join the World Trade Organisation, the very body that ought to be investigating cartels that do not operate in the (international) public interest. Second, the surge in oil prices should be taken as a wake-up call to the west to redouble its efforts to find alternative sources of energy against the day when oil runs down. Two areas offer outstanding potential but need far more resources thrown behind them. They are the development of hydrogen (the waste product of which is water) as a fuel to drive cars; and solar energy, where interesting advances are being made. Even in less sunny climates like the UK, solar energy has big possibilities. But in \"sunshine-rich\" developing countries, the potential is truly huge. To achieve this may require a degree of (unfashionable) planning between the private sector, governments and academia, but it has to be done, and quickly. The long-term consequences of not doing so are almost too terrible to contemplate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2000/jul/18/michaelellison","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-17T23:46:25Z","webTitle":"A pedestrian club with a sole purpose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/18/michaelellison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jul/18/michaelellison","fields":{"headline":"A pedestrian club with a sole purpose","bodyText":"It may not rank among the great issues of the day, such as the death penalty, healthcare, or what's wrong with the Yankees' pitching staff, but there are those, none the less, who are prepared to pay the ultimate price for it. \"I'll take a bullet for the cause,\" says Gordon Hlavenka, 42. The cause? Walking around without shoes. No one has been threatened with a gun yet, but members of the Dirty Sole Society do endure scorn and sneering. Mr Hlavenka, for instance, recently strode purposefully through a bank, a market, a McDonald's restaurant and a Wal-Mart supermarket in a Chicago suburb, daring the pillars of the American mall to object to his bare feet. A Wal-Mart employee obliged. \"You can't walk around here without shoes, that's against the law.\" Actually, it isn't. Nor is it illegal to drive barefoot, unless you happen to find yourself on a motorcycle in Alabama, though some other states warn against the practice. The society, which has followers throughout the United States, exists to promote the physical and spiritual elevation it claims is to be derived from discarding socks and shoes. Members take as one of their texts an article written in 1914 by James Leith Macbeth Bain, the Scottish mystic, poet and spiritual healer otherwise known as Brother James. \"For some years past,\" he wrote, \"I have tasted the delight and realised the energy of the joy of drinking in the sun's heat by walking on the hot pavements of London and other cities, and even Edinburgh, the Athens of good taste . . . \"My body was simply aglow with radiant energy.\" Brother James was an advocate of going hatless, too, although he did warn that doing so could result in harmful exposure to the sun. But, he said: \"I have never found that there is any such risk in the most free use and exposure of the feet to the solar energy.\" Lest anyone should run away with the idea that going barefoot is something to be taken lightly, Brother Jack suggested a gradual approach involving the use of sandals in public as the first step. The compromise appealed to Mr Hlavenka when he decided three years ago that something really must be done about the pungent whiff emanating from his sneakers. At first he would tip-toe around the block in the dead of night when he was sure the neighbours would not see him. In time he progressed to slipping into petrol stations to buy cartons of milk. And now, his pleasure no longer a secret, he does everything, including shovelling snow, in his bare feet. Well, almost everything: he wears shoes to church. Mr Hlavenka is by no means the sole warrior in the barefoot battle. The society has about 600 members, and among the heroes of the struggle are a violinist who plays concerts in Manhattan in the regulation tuxedo but without benefit of shoes; a Methodist minister in Saratoga Springs, New York, who performs services and weddings barefoot; and a software engineer in Ohio who was sent for psychological evaluation after presenting himself for work wearing nothing below the ankles. \"The Dirty Sole Society is open to all who enjoy going barefoot everywhere regardless of age, gender, nationality, race, religion or sexual orientation,\" its manifesto says. But there is much work still to be done. Consider the indignity visited upon the society's founder. Paul Lucas of Mountain View, California, was ejected from the Billy DeFrank Lesbian and Gay community centre in San Jose because it was afraid it would be sued if his feet were injured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2001/feb/13/highereducation.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2001-02-13T17:59:44Z","webTitle":"How government policy affects refugee academics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/feb/13/highereducation.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2001/feb/13/highereducation.uk","fields":{"headline":"But what now?","bodyText":"Like most academics, Abdul Lalzad talks eagerly about his research.

But as he talks at his bench at South Bank University in London his eyes betray deep anxiety and sadness. There is sadness for the wreck of his country under a regime which has driven him out and destroyed the university he was proud of. But uppermost in his mind is whether his wife and their five children will be allowed to join him after more than two years apart. They were being interviewed in Pakistan that day by the British High Commission about a visa. \"My mind is not here,\" he apologises. The professor of engineering from Kabul is one of 27 people now being helped by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara), a body which started in 1933 to help Jews and other victims of the Nazi purge of universities. The formation of what was then called the Academic Assistance Council was kick-started by a tumultuous meeting at the Albert Hall addressed by Albert Einstein. Today the centres of persecution have shifted via South Africa and Latin America to Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia, but the job of helping university teachers and researchers to pick themselves up after persecution and establish themselves in this country remains the same. The climate of hatred and distrust of asylum seekers is perhaps even worse than in the 1930s, although over the years Britain's reward for sheltering scholars has been out of all proportion to the tiny investment - 18 Nobel prizewinners, 71 fellows of the Royal Society, 50 fellows of the British Academy. The council campaigns on refugee issues and criticises what it sees as the worst excesses of government policy, such as the demeaning vouchers system. Its president, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, who himself was a political exile from South Africa, has attacked the \"wholly unacceptable\" Immigration and Asylum Act and the current wave of bigotry at a time of unprecedented prosperity: \"It is difficult to imagine the implications for the UK and the world had Karl Popper or Max Perutz - two of the scholars we supported - been dealt with in the demeaning way envisaged by the current legislation: in isolation from other scholars, dumped far from cen tres of learning and forced to live on benefits provided by vouchers.\" But most of the council's work is practical: advice about the labyrinthine asylum and social security regulations, making contact with university departments where they might be welcome, small grants for fees and travel. Cara limits its scope to helping genuine academics but even for this small section of the overall refugee population it could do a lot more if it had more funds. Professor Lalzad's case is typical. A specialist in thermal engineering with a Russian masters degree, he taught in the department of mechanical engineering at Kabul University. He had five textbooks and more than 30 published articles to his credit and had held senior university positions. When the victorious Taliban closed the university, he worked for the Red Cross, in charge of distributing thousands of tonnes of food to 40,000 widows and disabled people. He was arrested, beaten with Kalashnikovs and thrown in prison on suspicion of giving information to anti-Taliban forces. The influence of the Red Cross got him released, but his life was in danger and he fled to Pakistan, where his wife and children were eventually able to follow. He arrived at Heathrow in December 1998, to be grilled for hours by immigration officials who believed he was Pakistani because his English was so good. (It was the medium of instruction in his department.) Lalzad concedes that Pakistanis do try to enter the UK by claiming to be Afghan refugees, and is sure he would have been deported had he not produced his Red Cross identity card. Then came a frustrating wait while his application for asylum was considered (it took 18 months) and he tried to get work. \"I felt ashamed sitting at home.

The goal is a gadget consisting of a small box and a condenser. \"I hope it will be a very low cost and efficient technique for desalinating water that can be used in poor developing countries, especially where they have a lot of solar energy.\" He hopes to be able to resume teaching at his new university.

Behind him is the station with its snaking, glass-roofed Eurostar terminal. All around are roofs of every size and description. 'Look at this flat roof down here,' he says. The asphalt is covered in lichen and mould. 'It's a criminal waste.' He is shaking his head and frowning. For every roof, he sees a missed opportunity. On his own rooftop, where we are now standing, he has started a revolution. In between the pots of lavender and herbs stand several panels, each one packed with solar photovoltaic (solar PV) cells. It's a cloudy day, but as we stand and talk, the cells are working hard, absorbing light and transforming it into electricity. This is Leggett's very own power station, generating electricity to help run his four-storey office building below. His company, Solar Century, is, he says, 'on the edge of a $3 trillion market in global electricity supply'. And not a greenhouse gas in sight. 'Who knows how far it will go,' he says. 'It could go all the way. It's my belief that we have to literally replace fossil fuels... and that's an increasingly common view. Solar PV could do that.' The cells are made from silicon, a material that makes up 28 per cent of the earth's crust. 'There's BP's calculation that if you put solar cells of existing efficiency on all the available roofs in the UK, you could generate far more electricity than the country currently uses. It's just mind boggling to think of it. And we just squander it.' Leggett is a man on a mission, a personal crusade. Increasingly, however, he is not alone. Since launching Solar Century three years ago, he has been responsible for 49 Solar PV installations in the UK, from a remote farmhouse in Northumbria and a school in the Midlands to the Sainsbury petrol station in London's Greenwich - which generates 6,000kW hours of electricity a year, adding up to a reduction of 4,200kg of carbon dioxide a year. This means that more than 2 tonnes per year of carbon can stay in the ground instead of being released into the atmosphere. It's only a drop in the ocean. But it's a start. And more and more companies are investing money into similar projects, and not just as token experiments for healthy PR. The Rev Mary Coney is an Anglican priest and hermit who lives in the wilds of north Cornwall. On 26 July, she will be celebrating the first anniversary of her 12 monocrystalline modules, installed on the roof of her two-bedroom home, an old 1850s chapel. 'I did it as a gift to the environment, and to encourage other people,' she says. It cost her £11,000, and although she is hoping to generate 75 per cent of her electricity needs this year, she is not going to make her money back. 'I did it not for gain, but as a matter of principle,' she insists. The local press loved it when she had the panel installed. 'Priest gets energy from above,' fanfared one headline. She has joined the Eastern Energy Solarnet scheme which pays her for the electricity she exports back to the national grid. Since last autumn, she has paid out £90 and made £59 back. Although it works less effectively on dark rainy days, Rev Coney is delighted to confirm it doesn't take sunshine to generate electricity. 'I don't think there's been a day when it has made nothing,' she says. 'And I'm more conscious of the electricity I use than before. I feel like I'm living in an experiment.' During its lifetime (20 to 30 years), Mary Coney's roof has the potential to prevent more than 34 tonnes of greenhouse emissions. Solar PV has all the signs of becoming The Next Big Thing. Solar Century's 50th installation is about to be completed - a roof for the house of the comedian Mark Thomas. And its huge panel in the Big Brother house has been liberally splashed around our television screens over the past weeks. Paul Smith recently used the cells to power a mobile phone as part of a window display in his Covent Garden store, and Rod Stewart's sun-kissed Malibu home is solar powered, too. Leggett's own house in Richmond was the first in the country to be fitted with a solar PV-tiled roof. It is a pretty Victorian cottage, like all the others on the street. When you look at the roof, however, the slates are different. Instead of the usual dark grey, these are bright blue, and sparkle in the sunlight. In the past, solar panels have been literally bolted on to rooftops, or installed next to the house like a hi-tech billboard. But here, the Sunslates and the house are fully integrated. Far from being an eyesore, they make the roof a thing of beauty, as well as providing 1.6kW of power, which was more than Leggett needed to run the house. So not only did he create his own mini power station, he was able to sell 14 per cent back to the utility. Although the initial outlay is expensive - Leggett's roof cost £13,000 - how satisfying it must be to receive a cheque from your electricity supplier rather than a bill. 'It's the essence of thinking globally and acting locally,' Leggett says. 'It's very empowering. We tend to find that our customers become energy-efficiency fanatics. It's not logical and I admit to this myself, but with the house in Richmond, as soon as I had that roof on, I couldn't bear to think of the electricity being wasted, so I would go round turning all the lights off when I wasn't in a room. That's what we're finding with other people. A typical house with a solar roof will be saving a tonne of carbon dioxide a year directly. But indirectly, it would be saving even more.' There is, of course, a major stumbling block. We would all love to be running our washing machines and light bulbs from a cool, modern Sunslate roof. But who can afford the initial outlay? A solar roof such as Leggett's in Richmond adds value to a property, as he discovered when he recently sold it for £10,000 above the expected price. Solar Century has arranged with NatWest Mortgages to provide a 25-year solar mortgage at the usual rates. But even Leggett admits the cheapest way of having a solar roof is to buy a new house where the work has already been done. Prices will only come down when solar roofs become the norm. 'I don't know when it's going to happen,' says Leggett. 'But it's coming soon to a housing estate and a car showroom near you. It has to happen soon because the gravity of the global environmental crisis is so transparently huge. Shell said recently that the single most important source of electricity in 2050 will be solar. We think it is wrong: it's going to happen much sooner than 2050.' His optimism is as infectious as it is surprising. This is a man who has spent the past decade lobbying, advising and urging big business and governments around the world that something has to be done about global warming before it is too late. His 1999 book, The Carbon War (£8.99, Penguin), is a compelling diary of the events that took him, as director of science for Greenpeace, around the world from one climate-change conference to the next. The events that led to the drawing up of the Kyoto Treaty - and President Bush's subsequent attitude towards it - make for depressing reading. It is as though, page after page, Leggett and his fellow environmentalist are banging their heads against a wall. But, as he says, walls have a habit of crumbling down. He mentions Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point (£14.99, Little Brown). 'There's a great argument in this book that huge transformations in societies can be likened to epidemics that just spread and catch fire, and I have the feeling that this is one such possible thing. When the energy status quo starts to collapse, it will go faster than the Berlin Wall. We didn't see the foundations of that being undermined. We just woke up one day and it was being torn down, and a few months later Soviet Communism was gone as well. If that can happen, then we can turn this around. It's that sense of opportunity that keeps me optimistic.' This is not just the wishful thinking of a few environmentalist cranks. Renewable energies have the potential to be massive business. In the epilogue to his book, Leggett explains why he left Greenpeace to become a solar-energy entrepreneur. 'The global solar PV market grew by more than 30 per cent in 1999,' he writes. 'The solar revolution, like the enormity of the global-warming threat itself, is no longer in doubt.' Earlier this month, BP Solar, which has a 20 per cent share of the market, worth $200m a year, announced it will be building the largest solar production plant in the world in Spain, with a five-fold increase in production. 'We get regular calls now from investment banks,' says Leggett. 'There is a new business revolution coming called ET - the Energy Technology boom. The Economist has referred to it as the micro-power revolution. We just refer to it as the Solar Revolution, recognising that our particular technology is, we think, going to be the centrepiece of the revolution. But we don't think our technology is the magic bullet - there is a whole family of other renewable energies.' The DTI agrees. It recently set a target to install 70,000 solar roofs in the UK by 2010. By then, 10 per cent of electricity generated in the UK must come from renewables such as solar and wind. The Crown Estates recently announced it is to set up 18 offshore wind farms. These alone will double the 2.3 per cent of energy generated by renewables in the UK. The government is also monitoring nine schemes up and down the country which use solar PV. Solar Century won contracts for three of them - a housing association project in Maidenhead, an office building in Manchester, and a Laing Homes housing estate in Edmonton, north London. Nine three-bedroom townhouses on North Nine, an estate of 241 homes, have been fitted with solar slates, at the cost of around £80 per slate. The DTI picked up the bill. In return, it will monitor the houses for two years. They are the first houses to be built with Solar PV roofs by a developer for private sale. Because of the DTI funding, they have sold at the same price as other non-solar houses on the estate. However, according to a spokesperson for Laing, there is not 'a shadow of a doubt that this will happen across whole developments.' David Ley, Solar Century's architect, is working on a number of large-scale projects to tie in with the government's second stage of funding. There will be 15 buildings in total, with £3m expected to be released in the autumn. 'One of the criteria for the project is they want schemes to be going up in the next 18 months,' says Ley. 'It'll be amazing to see it. The first generation of PV was literally just about bolting it on to roofs. But we're now on to the next stage where it's integrated into whole buildings.' The newest PV cells come in a rainbow of colours, as well as transparent. 'We want to put them into a walling system, or as louvres or a sunscreen. We can even put them into the glass and windows.' Paul Hinkin, a director at Chetwood Associates, specialises in bioclimatic design, using renewable energies. 'If we are to stand any chance of meeting Kyoto commitments, we need to have this level of thinking on all our developments,' he says. 'The interesting thing about this approach is you can tether architectural design to environmental performance, to create buildings where the look is intrinsically linked to function and the aesthetic is led by performance.' This August, desktop publisher John Malone, 23, and his 20-year-old Finnish girlfriend will be moving into their new one-bedroom Maidenhead and District Housing Association flat in Windsor. It is a good example of a performance-led aesthetic. 'From the outside, it looks completely futuristic,' says Malone, who will be moving from a council house he currently shares with his family. 'The first thing you see is the bright blue solar panels and the green turf on the roofs.' Their home is part of a development of 19 flats and eight houses, built with local authority and DTI funding. They cost 10 per cent more to build, but will be more economical to run. It is the country's largest development of Integer 'intelligent' houses. Any electricity not used will be exported back to the national grid and tenants will be paid for it. New-build social housing and community buildings will be increasingly used as a platform for solar technology. For those who can afford it, however, buying your own mini power station is not such a crazy idea any more. According to Leggett, it is the perfect solution. 'Take the California energy crisis which is the front line of global warming now,' he says. 'Through a combination of bizarre circumstances, California has got itself into the most enormous fix. The lights are going to go out this summer time and time again. Bush is arguing they will have to build new power plants every few days - plants that take years to construct. It's just insanity... like something out of a Ben Elton novel. If it wasn't so tragic, it would be hilarious. The only way you can build a power plant in Californian in a matter of weeks, which is what they need, is with micro power. Each and every one of them could have a solar roof to provide all its electricity. End of problem. But they are not about to say anything or do anything in their lunatic energy policy that remotely makes that happen.' It is not hard to get Leggett on to his favourite subject. And it's not hard to make him angry. But he's determined to channel that anger into something positive. His solar revolution has only just begun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2001/feb/25/ecotourism.ecuador.wildlifeholidays","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2001-02-25T18:00:53Z","webTitle":"Life after the oilspill in the real Jurassic Park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2001/feb/25/ecotourism.ecuador.wildlifeholidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2001/feb/25/ecotourism.ecuador.wildlifeholidays","fields":{"headline":"Life after the oilspill in the real Jurassic Park","bodyText":"The passengers looked down grimly from the deck as their luxury cruise ship, the Galapagos Explorer II, sailed out from the harbour past the eerie wreck of the oil tanker Jessica, lying on its side, semi-submerged in the azure Galapagos waters. The Jessica had been on its way to refuel the very same Explorer II when it struck rocks last month and regurgitated its filthy load into this priceless marine paradise. This was the first trip by the Explorer II since the accident. For tourists visiting the area there is no sign of oily waters, black beaches or dead wildlife. Conservationists estimate just one pelican perished, while several sea lions and 100 birds had to be rescued from the oil and cleaned up. Millions of invertebrates at the bottom of the fragile food chain were destroyed and the marine iguanas' food source of algae was contaminated. The near catastrophe has raised questions about ecotourism in this supposedly pristine marine reserve. The debate is particularly pertinent for Ecuador which contains part of the stunning Andes mountain chain and is blessed with ownership of the Galapagos Islands as well as a large chunk of virgin rainforest at the top of the Amazon basin. The passengers on board the Explorer II earlier this month spoke of their relief at arriving to find clean seas. Quiet relief turned to excitement as they caught the first glimpse of the islands' unique creatures. Blue-footed boobies flew within feet of the dinghies, while pelicans skimmed heads as they dived like combat aircraft into shallow water in search of fish. People tripped over sleeping sea lions on the curved white beach and had close encounters with others staring into their masks while out snorkelling. Lurid green and red marine iguanas basked on rocks like prehistoric statues while visitors snapped away on their cameras. The Galapagos's animals are famously fearless of humans. Only the bright orange ghost crabs ran away: they are one of the few creatures in this isolated archipelago that have natural enemies. On Genovesa, just to the north of the Equator , groups from the Explorer II climbed the steep laval outcrops to find hundreds of masked boobies whistling their haunting mating calls to the sky, and frigate birds puffing out their red chest pouches. The unique giant tortoises that helped inspire Charles Darwin's breakthrough work on evolution in 1859, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , were to be seen in the captive breeding programmes at the Charles Darwin station on Santa Cruz island or, in a more natural setting, up in the hills nearby, where they creep freely through the trees. A short woodland trail ends suddenly in a vast lagoon, where the tortoises paddle in slow motion surrounded by huge ferns in a scene straight out of Jurassic Park . Unfortunately, on this particular expedition, the tour bus bumped into one of the giant creatures blocking the track. The guide jumped down from the bus and heaved the tortoise by its shell on to the verge. And this is where the foundations of ecotourism start to look a bit shaky. Despite warnings from nature guides not to disturb anything at all, one passenger snapped her fingers at preening birds to get a good camera shot; another pocketed a crab shell; one hugged a tortoise; and there was frequent spillage of suncream, which harms the coral and seals. Meanwhile, the ship itself makes much of its use of biodegradable soaps, while its engine uses a vile mix of diesel and so-called bunker - a heavier, low-grade fuel - and its 105-passenger capacity makes it the largest of the 82 cruise ships allowed here. With sealed window cabins and 24-hour air conditioning, it con stantly pumps black smoke from its funnels and admits to dumping the contents of its toilets out at sea in the dead of night. The Explorer II's expedition leader and naturalist guide Billy Chiquito said: 'In the beginning, tour boats had saltwater showers and no air conditioning, but tourists demand more luxury. It would cost a lot to convert our engine but we are looking at putting electric engines on the dinghies.' Annual tourist limits in the Galapagos have soared in the last five years from 45,000 to 70,000, and the mostly fifty-something visitors fly in on 30-year-old jets. Chiquito said that only 8 per cent of the 4,500 square mile land mass of the islands is accessible to tourists on controlled itineraries, while only 3 per cent of the land is inhabited. Tourists' main contribution to the region is the $100 compulsory visitor tax paid by each one. Chiquito complained that most of the money was siphoned off by the Ecuadorian government. But Jennifer Stone, of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which is linked to the Charles Darwin Foundation, said she was confident, since the rules were tightened up in 1998, that 95 per cent of the tax reaches the islands. Stone and other conservationists believe the Galapagos environment is less under threat from tourism than from the fishing industry, the invasion of 'alien' species, such as goats, horses and rats, and the permanent community of 16,000 Galapagos residents. One local guide said: 'There are little oil spills and diesel dumping from cruise boats and fishing boats around here all the time - but they never tell you about that.' Oil may be a dirty word in the Galapagos but it is regarded as black gold on the mainland, where it is the chief earner of export revenues since Texaco struck rich reserves in the north-east of Ecuador in the Seventies. Vast areas of jungle and the culture of many indigenous communities have been destroyed in the pursuit of wealth - a familiar story across the Amazon. Now several oil companies from North America and Europe are closing in on the glorious rainforest in the south-east of Ecuador, where nature and the blow-gun hunting lifestyle of the Shuar and Achuar indigenous people have remained relatively untouched. In the heart of this region on the Peruvian border and at least 20 days' walk from the nearest town is the Kapawi Eco Lodge, a tourism venture created in a pact between the Achuar community and the same Ecuadorian business venture, Canodros, that owns the Explorer II cruise ship. Up to 40 tourists a time are flown in on tiny planes, landing on mud air strips. The Kapawi lodge runs on solar energy, log cabins (built with wooden nails) and rules of one five-minute shower for each person a day under dim lighting. The lack of concrete, Tarmac and mechanical noise is a tonic, the air instead being filled with the sounds of whooping birds, cicadas and howler monkeys, and the scent of steamy undergrowth. Visitors can go kayaking, camping, bird and alligator-watching and, most controversially, visiting Achuar villages, which elicited mixed reactions, with some groups loving it, others squirming at the intrusion. The main activity, though, is forest treks, with an English-speaking Ecuadorian and an Achuar guide. But hasn't the replacement of nudity with jeans and T-shirts and the arrival of aeroplanes, Christianity, school and dollar-wielding tourists blighted the character and culture of the rainforest? Achuar workers at Kapawi argue that leaving everything in the rainforest untouched is not an option. Some want to travel to the capital Quito or abroad to work and study. Others want to stay in the forest living traditionally in huts but with access to schools and air evacuation for medical treatment. That means dollars, which means saying yes to oil, logging or tourists. It took a year of intense negotiations before the Finae, the representative body of the 80,000-strong Achuar community, agreed to admit Kapawi in 1994, on the basis that lower-impact, lucrative tourism is the lesser of the evils. Kapawi pays the Achuar $2,000 a month and has a deal to hand over ownership of the lodge to them entirely in 2011. But all the time, the oil companies, with the Ecuadorian government's blessing, visit the Finae and offer them untold billions to let them tear up the forest. Senior Achuar guide and community leader Irar Washike, said the pressure from the oil industry was immense. 'But we have heard what has happened in the north and we will not let them build roads and bring contamination here,' he said. He believes that projects such as Kapawi are conservationist and he is desperate for the Finae to resist selling out to Big Oil. 'Most Achuar feel the same about this. Even if it was my own brother who got bribed, I would kill him to stop the oil companies getting in here.' Many believe the concept of ecotourism is at best a complex solution in a consumers' world, at worst an oxymoron. The dilemma is keenly felt in a country as vivid but fragile as tiny Ecuador. Back on board the Explorer II, one of the local naturalists remarked ruefully that the Jessica accident was an early warning of what could happen if Ecuador was careless with its priceless inheritance. 'But we haven't done so badly, despite being a poor country,' he remarked. 'If America or Europe owned the Galapagos islands or our rainforest I believe they would be covered in Holiday Inns and freeways by now.'

Environmentalists claimed a moral victory after 13.5% of proxy votes were cast in favour of a resolution calling on the oil major to halt its Alaskan Northstar development and abandon any future plans to drill in the Arctic. Campaigners argued that the money should be channelled instead into renewable energy projects - a move which was soundly rejected by the BP board both before and after the voting figures were released. Simon Billenness, a spokesman for Trillium Asset Management, one of the proposers of the motion, said it was a very high level of support given that it was a first time motion. \"I think BP will be forced to change direction as it represents a defeat for them,\" he insisted. But a company spokesman said it would be ridiculous to change policy since 86.5% had voted against the resolution. Sir John Browne, chief executive, told the meeting that the plans for Northstar were supported by local communities, insisted that there were no plans at present to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and added that the company was already the leading proponent of solar energy. On executive pay, a steady stream of pensioner shareholders attacked proposed changes to the BP executive pay scheme contained in one of the other resolutions. One woman said: \"You are already drawing levels of pay that you can't spend. It's all absurd.\" She argued that the board should set an example to other big companies by halting ever-bigger pay increases. Peter Sutherland, the chairman, defended Sir John's £1.4m salary and a new performance-related pay scheme. Shareholders would not thank them if they lost top talent to competitors because payscales were not right. He said that BP Amoco had completed another year of \"historic and momentous progress.\" BP Amoco said last night it had now received clearance for the merger with Atlantic Richfield from the Federal Trade Commission. Sir John said: \"We are very pleased to have received FTC approval. We will now rapidly implement the plans we have to integrate our operations worldwide. We intend to move quickly to deliver the significant value of this union to the shareholders of the new group.\" The news came shortly after ExxonMobil confirmed it had agreed to buy Arco's Alaskan assets. The US giant had earlier begun legal action against BP Amoco in a bid to stop it selling Arco's stake in the Prudhoe Bay oil and gas field to Phillips."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2001/dec/09/features.magazine57","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2001-12-09T00:29:39Z","webTitle":"Lynn Barber meets Uri Geller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/dec/09/features.magazine57","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2001/dec/09/features.magazine57","fields":{"headline":"The magic touch","bodyText":"I have the strongest sense of déjà vu as I approach Uri Geller's house in Sonning, Berkshire. I know exactly what the interior will be like before he opens the door - marble floors and silk-lined walls, knicker blinds and velvet cushions, glass tables densely covered with knick-knacks, rows of crystals, piles of soft toys, blodgy paintings with titles like Awakening. Does this mean I have psychic powers? No, it means I interviewed Uri Geller 12 years ago and the house has barely changed. I still have the spoon he bent the last time; now I have another one. Naturally, given his amazing mind powers, I expect him to remember - but he doesn't. There is no question that Uri Geller can bend spoons. I have seen him do it twice, when I was near enough to touch and, of course, I have seen him do it on television. Every journalist who ever interviews him comes back with a bent spoon. He says that he has probably bent a spoon for someone every day of his life since the 60s, and he loves seeing people's reactions. My problem is - what reaction to make? He takes me to the kitchen, opens the cutlery drawer, takes out a spoon at random, holds it over the sink, strokes it and bends it. My reaction is: 'Oh yes, another bent spoon.' If it's a trick, I can't see it. But then I can't ever see conjuring tricks either, even when they're explained to me. And nowadays he utters rather heavy legal threats against anyone who calls him a conjuror or a trickster or a fraud. On the other hand, he doesn't like to be called a psychic - he prefers to talk about his 'paranormal' powers. My dictionary defines paranormal as 'abnormal, esp. psychologically', which seems fair enough. Spoon-bending is his most reliable skill, but he also claims that he can mend broken watches, find minerals by dowsing, grow seedlings from seeds in his hand, and read people's minds. However, I don't think he can read minds very well, because otherwise he would have noticed my mind screaming, 'Oh please don't!' every time he said, 'Let me tell you a story, Lynn.' He prides himself on being 'a great storyteller', just like Jeffrey Archer, and going round the house takes forever because every single sodding object has a story attached. The framed exercise bike on the wall, for instance, is not the pointless piece of junk it appears to be, but a bike that belonged to the late Bruce Beresford, 'a British cyclist who asked me many years ago to help him break the world record', while the dubious late Dali sculpture is a reminder that he studied for two years under Dali, who taught him to stop painting farmers and concentrate on 'symbolic subjects' instead. Painting, he says, is now his passion - he designs plates for Poole Pottery and one of his designs is included in the booklet for the new Michael Jackson CD. But he probably makes more money from writing, given that he is frighteningly prolific - he has written at least 16 books, and his latest, Unorthodox Encounters, comes out this month. He also writes a weekly column for the Jewish Telegraph and a 'World of Stars' column for The Face. But he complains that: 'It's very hard for me to break into the literary world, because people are constantly occupied with my spoon-bending and the intelligentsia will say, \"Stick to that.\"' In fact, he rarely bends spoons publicly now - instead, he puts all his mind-bending power into giving 'motivational and inspirational' lectures. It all seems a bit of a comedown from the great days of the 70s, when he could command six-figure fees for one television appearance - I get the impression that financially his spoon is bending. The day I visited, he said he was very upset because he had just said farewell to his gardeners, who had been working for him for 14 years and were like family. Would he replace them? No, he said, his wife Hanna liked doing the garden. (Poor old Hanna - all those lawns.) But also his house has been on the market for years. It was first advertised in 1991 at £10m, then again in 1998 at £5.5m but it is still waiting for a buyer. 'I came to a stage when I didn't need any marble around me, or gold taps, or silk walls. I've grown out of that. I want a rustic house, something strange, technologically empowered to turn around like by solar energy, on some little plot by the river - half an acre would be enough for me. I'm happy here, but if some day I really have to move, I will drop the price drastically.' The children are grown up and Hanna, he says, will have no qualms about moving. 'We are soul mates. If I am happy to live in a Bedouin tent, either in the Sinai desert or the Kalahari, she will be with me.' What about his poor old 88-year-old mother, who lives with them? 'She will always be with us, wherever I go. She will have her little solar-powered wing with 360 of view turning round all day long. I will never abandon my mother.' And presumably Shipi Shtrang, his brother-in-law and manager, will come, too, because they have all been together for 30 years. Meanwhile, Geller beavers away at his writing, painting, broadcasting, lecturing, working all the time, in cars, in aeroplanes, on his exercise bike. He cycles for an hour, at least 27 miles every morning, and writes his books and emails while he pedals. He says he has so much surplus energy he has to burn it off in the mornings - if he is staying in a hotel where he can't use his bike, he runs up and down 30 or 40 flights of stairs instead. Presumably, this accounts for his extreme thinness. He admits, 'There is maybe a slight addictiveness in my exercise. But I love it - don't misunderstand me, this is not some kind of torture I'm going through.' A large part of his day is taken up with answering emails. They come from all over the world, and he loves getting them - do send him one, his address is urigeller@compuserve.com. Many are from teenagers and numerology nuts who share his belief in the significance of the number 11. But there are also heart-breaking cries for help from parents of sick children. He has an extraordinary system for answering them. He prints them out, scrawls his replies, then scans them to Bombay, where two young Indian brothers type out his answers and email them back to his correspondents. 'They love it,' says Geller, 'because they get an email directly from Uri Geller! Some of them can hardly believe it!' However, when my daughter emailed him, she got a one-sentence reply from Uri and reams and reams of 'for your information' about all the Geller products she could buy. Salesmanship seems to be at the root of everything he does. Take, for instance, his friendship with Michael Jackson, which he has been plugging mercilessly for over a year. Doubters like me were properly silenced, nay gobsmacked, when Michael Jackson appeared as best man at his wedding in March. It was one of the best stunts he has ever pulled off - but how did it happen? Geller says his friendship with Jackson started about five years ago when he was 'sitting in Mohammed Al Fayed's tent' - he has a tent in his garden in Sussex - and Michael Jackson called up from New York. Fayed said, 'Guess who I've got with me? Uri Geller,' and Jackson screamed, 'Oh, Uri Geller!' so Fayed handed over the phone, and Jackson asked Geller to come and see him next time he was in New York. So, of course, Geller jumped on a plane - but getting hold of Jackson was not so easy, because Jackson moves constantly, not only from town to town, but to different hotels in the same town, and has an elaborate system of cut-out numbers and passwords to screen callers. Geller had to ring a Holiday Inn somewhere in mid-America and leave a message for Mr Robinson - but two hours later Jackson got back to him. They met at Jackson's studio, where he was working on his new album - he was 'anxious and wracked with self-doubt' and asked Geller to compose a meditation that would calm his mind 'when the fear of failure started to bite'. One day, Jackson rang and said he'd met the Dalai Lama but was not very impressed, so Geller said, 'Well, let me introduce you to someone who I think will impress you,' and arranged a meeting with his friend Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, of Kosher Sex fame. Boteach was rabbi at Oxford University and had written a book with Geller called Confessions of a Rabbi and a Psychic . Apparently, they hit it off, and Boteach took Jackson to a New York synagogue - Jackson dressed for the occasion in a black fedora, sunglasses, pink and green tie, white socks, and carrying a little bouquet. Perhaps this was his peace gesture for writing the line, 'Jew me! Sue me!' which has tended to make him unpopular with Jews. Then - cut to 2001 - Boteach arranged for Jackson to speak to the Oxford Union and Geller said, 'Oh, if he's coming to England, could he be my best man?' You might think it a bit odd that Geller felt this sudden urge to get married, given that he'd been with Hanna since the 60s, and they had two grown-up children. Moreover, they had married twice before - once in a hippie ceremony under the sky, and once in a register office in Budapest. But apparently it was weighing on his mind that they'd never had a Jewish wedding. His first thought was to hold this Jewish wedding at Stonehenge, but unfortunately Jackson's security people vetoed the idea. So they had it at Sonning, with Hello! in attendance, and a 'star-studded guest list' including Nigel Mansell, Eve Pollard, David Frost and Patti Boulaye. Jackson arrived two hours late, on crutches because he'd broken his foot (Geller told the tabloids that he would cure it by psychic healing, but unfortunately it was still in plaster on the day), and Rabbi Boteach entertained the guests with a string of wisecracks. Jackson said if he'd known he was meant to be best man he would have arrived on time. It looked like just about the naffest publicity stunt it was possible to pull, but of course naff is not a word in Geller's vocabulary. 'I asked Michael if he would be my best man and he said, \"Yes - why not?\"' Why not? Well for a start he's not Jewish, and second, they've only met a handful of times. 'No, but he is a very deeply spiritual person and I consider him a very close friend. I actually asked Shipi, my brother-in-law, because obviously I wanted Shipi to be my best man - but we both said, why not Michael Jackson? Shipi said, \"Well, everyone will think that you're doing it for the publicity.\" Nonsense! I don't need that publicity, I have enough publicity. I had to go according to my instincts. I don't care what people think. I don't care if they think it was some kind of publicity bang to put my name on the cover of Hello! magazine - because I know that that's what you're trying to get at.' Evidently the mind-reading is finally working, but just in case it's not, I spell it out for him: it looks like exploitation, to turn a wedding into a publicity stunt. Geller explodes into a sort of sulky tantrum. 'Well, if some people think this was an exploitation then fuck them. That's all I have to say! This is my wedding! This is my wife! This is my family, and I'll do what pleases me, what I find fun. Shouldn't a wedding be fun? Come on! Now, there were, of course, financial arrangements but I didn't pocket any money from my wedding. It all went to the charity. Of course! If Hello! paid money, it was a great outlet for me, so some sick children will benefit from my wedding. If anyone has a problem with that - fuck them! Sorry that I'm using foul language, but I'm angry if someone will tell me that I created a wedding for exploitation purposes or publicity purposes.' Anyway, his next plan is to take Michael Jackson on a 'peace mission' to the Middle East. He has contacts who can arrange meetings with the kings of Morocco and Jordan, and, 'Ariel Sharon is no problem. I just feel that it will be a fantastic journey for peace. The focal point of the three main religions is concentrated on Jerusalem, and that is why I feel that going there with Michael, with Shmuley, and maybe with other positive people who are singers, but nothing to do with politics, we will make something happen.' But they won't go just at present, he explains, because the situation is too dangerous. So here's this spoon-bender in Berkshire, cycling away like a lunatic, answering emails from schoolkids, and planning to bring about world peace. Uri Geller is fond of asking, 'Who is Uri Geller?' (he often talks about himself in the third person) and it's a question anyone who meets him is bound to ask. He is a very strange man, and not only in his strange ability to bend spoons. Where did he come from? One tempting answer is outer space - his biographer, Jonathan Margolis, says Geller always reminds him of Mork in Mork &amp; Mindy - but the fact that he has a mother still living militates against that idea. She comes from Hungary by way of Israel and denies any extraterrestrial involvement. But she confirms that Uri was bending spoons by the time he was four. Obviously, he had a very disrupted, even traumatic, childhood. He was born in what was then British-ruled Palestine in 1946, two years before the creation of Israel. His earliest memory is of gunshot breaking the window over his cradle, and broken glass falling on his teddy bear. His father was a soldier in the British Army in Palestine, and fought against Rommel in the Desert War. Later, he joined the Israeli army, as a sergeant, and fought in the Six Day War, but in peacetime he was a Tel Aviv taxi driver. He was devastatingly handsome and a great womaniser - Uri describes him as 'like a film star'. But he was a reluctant parent - he made Uri's mother have eight abortions before Uri was born. Uri was afraid of his father, who beat him, but he also hero-worshipped him. So he was devastated when his parents split up when he was nine, and left him in a kibbutz for a year. Eventually, his mother collected him and took him to live in Cyprus where she remarried and ran a small hotel called the Pension Ritz. Uri went to the American school and learnt English - his first two languages were Hungarian and Hebrew. But when his stepfather died, he and his mother returned to Israel. He worked as a construction labourer until he was drafted into the army, fought in the Six Day War, was wounded and invalided out, and then became a male model. Bending spoons was his party trick and one day he did it at a party attended by Golda Meir. Next day, she was interviewed on the radio and said something like, 'If you want to know about the future, ask Uri Geller.' Suddenly he was famous in Israel, and went round the country doing a mind-reading and spoon-bending act. But after a while, he admitted, he resorted to trickery - he had an assistant who wrote down all the car numberplates in the car park, so he could 'magically' refer to them in his show. Then he was invited to Stanford Research Institute in California - he believes at the instigation of the CIA - to take part in tests for extrasensory perception. David Dimbleby read about these tests in a scientific journal and asked Geller to appear on television in England. This was in 1972 and caused an absolute sensation - there were weeks on end when you couldn't open a newspaper without seeing some reference to spoon-bending. Geller always says that England made him - but he soon moved to the States in pursuit of even greater fame and fortune. 'In the 70s,' he says, 'my whole mentality was different. I really was on an ego trip.' He loved hobnobbing with stars; he loved driving around in his customised Cadillac covered in 5,000 bent spoons and forks (it still sits in his garage in Sonning). But he came a cropper in 1973 when he appeared on the Johnny Carson show and completely failed to do any of his tricks. Carson had enlisted some magicians to watch him at work, and for once, his spoons failed to bend, the sealed boxes failed to reveal their secrets. It didn't stop his career in the States - there were plenty of other chat shows - but it made him rather paranoid. 'A major war was declared on Uri Geller to debunk me, to try to destroy not only my credibility but my livelihood, too.' And he was under constant attack from the Bible Belt, who called him a satanist. Towards the end of the 70s, the pressure got too much and he became bulimic. 'I went through hell for a year. I think the main reason was because I came from poverty, and suddenly I was catapulted into stardom and money started pouring in. So I got my Gucci shoes, my Rolex watches, and hundreds of silk shirts, and when I couldn't really buy any more to put on my body, then it slid into wanting to put something into my body. I remember once at the Savoy Hotel I ordered all the desserts, and devoured everything. But I didn't want to be fat, so I went to the toilet and stuffed my finger down my throat, and it became addictive. When I couldn't stick my finger any more, I used toothbrushes. For a year, I managed to hide it from Hanna - I would flush the toilet, open the showers, stuff Kleenex under the doors to hide the noise of vomiting. 'But I realised one day that I'd lost all my strength. I couldn't get out of my car, I just pulled myself out of my Cadillac, and held the roof, and I screamed out three times, \"Uri Geller, stop, stop, stop it!\" - and I never did it again.' He spent a year in Japan, living quietly with his family in a village under Mount Fuji, with no telephone, no fax, 'to cleanse myself spiritually'. And then he came to England and settled in Sonning in 1983. He is very attached to the neighbourhood - he says even if they sell the house, he still hopes to end his days in Berkshire. He and Hanna live a quiet life - the house is showy but their lifestyle is modest. They go out occasionally to charity bashes, where he will sign autographs and be very friendly and approachable, but: 'When I am at home, I need privacy. This is my little paradise.' One of the many odd things about him is that he doesn't handle money - he claims not to have used credit cards or written a cheque for 30 years. His brother-in-law Shipi does all that. He says he has always felt guilty about earning money, so he prefers not to touch it. How would he fill the car up with petrol? 'She does that, Hanna. I don't do that. I create. I write and I paint and I lecture - I indulge myself with 95 per cent creativity and nothing can taint that side of my life.' He can maintain this odd rule because he never goes anywhere alone. The longest time he has been alone as an adult is when he spent two days at a monastery under Mount Sinai while researching his sci-fi novel Ella. 'It was a very strange feeling. Since then, I am never alone. Yes, I have slept alone in hotel rooms, but Shipi would be in the next room. I'm no fool. I drive cars and if I had to write a cheque, I would know how to make the cheque out, and I would probably know where to push the credit card to take money out of cash deposit boxes and so on.' Hmm, doesn't sound too promising. 'But the only time I am alone is when I walk with my dogs, every day, for half an hour.' He couldn't board a plane alone, or even drive up to London. It is part of his odd, deliberately cultivated child-like quality - the quality, I suppose, that he shares with Michael Jackson. So who is Uri Geller? The main thing that strikes me is that he is like a teenager - he has a teenager's rapturous self-absorption, he could talk about the wonder that is Uri Geller for ever. But, also like a teenager, he wobbles between braggadocio and self-doubt - he can be easily deflated. He is desperate to impress authority figures and is over-impressed by them in turn. (England represents authority in his eyes.) He is thrilled by celebrities, any celebrities, however tawdry. He doesn't really understand society, or normal human interaction, so he invents some higher extraterrestrial society to which he belongs. Alone, walking by the river with his dogs, or pedalling on his bike or staring into his computer, he is a prince among men - or perhaps a Martian among earthlings. In the real world, he knows, he is a rather awkward misfit whom only his family can understand. · Unorthodox Encounters, by Uri Geller, is published by Robson Books."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/apr/11/1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-11T01:03:07Z","webTitle":"City briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/apr/11/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/apr/11/1","fields":{"headline":"City briefing","bodyText":"Virgin to bid for Great Western Britain's two largest train companies, Virgin and Stagecoach, are prepared to mount a bid for the Great Western franchise, the operator at the centre of the Southall and Paddington train crashes.

Earlier this year Volvo's bid for fellow truck maker Scandia was thwarted by the European Union's competition authorities. A merger of the two truck businesses is seen as creating a group with sufficient critical mass to compete effectively while the cross shareholding would make Volvo - currently seen as vulnerable to a bid - a more difficult takeover target.

Show houses that utilise solar energy, recycling and state of the art technology have been built to demonstrate to buyers how new homes will look within the next 10 years. While the technology is in place to bring video-conferencing, sensor controlled heating and lighting into living rooms and bedrooms, only a handful of developers are including innovations in all their properties. Demand for a house fit for the future is low, say developers. Those working at the cutting edge say developers themselves are to blame for the fact that the appearance of new homes has changed little in the last 100 years. Architect Nicholas Thompson of Cole Thompson Associates says: \"The industry is using yesterday's technologies. We're in an information age but we're still putting up stone-age buildings.\" Sarah Bailey of Laing Homes rejects the charge. She spent several years with a former employer trying in vain to interest people in facilities that enabled them to recycle their water. Environment friendly technology is not what interests the public, she says: \"Privacy and security are the key to most people when buying a home.\" But a handful of forward-looking developers have beavered away on projects they hope will persuade Britons to abandon their prejudices and opt for something new. In the future buildings will make greater use of intelligent and green technologies, says Mr Thompson. He heads the Integer project, a group of designers and consultants who have a shared aim of developing houses that use sustainable materials and provide value for money while meeting environmental and technological standards. State of the art usually means expensive, but not with Integer buildings, argues Mr Thompson. The use of pre-fabricated panels and even ready assembled bathroom \"pods\" can save time and money, he says. Within the next couple of weeks the shell of a three-storey house on a social housing development with Sandwell council will be complete. By the end of April the builders hope to have installed the inside. In all the build will take 28 weeks - a saving of 20 weeks on the conventional construction. Berkeley Homes is trying out Integer principles in a development in Newbury, Berkshire. Here computers will control the heating and lighting, while the water will be recycled within the house and heated by solar energy. The house will be the subject of research on the benefits of its design and construction. Laing Homes has teamed up with Cisco Systems, the net experts, to build a five-bedroom show home tagged the \"internet house\" in Nascot Wood, Watford. The technology allows the heating, TV, security, garden watering and toaster to be operated from the office or car via a website. From the outside, the home is much like any other family home. Inside, the computer in the house allows someone in one room to check on what another member of the family is doing elsewhere. The inhabitants on the move can use a laptop to draw curtains and turns lights on in preparation for their return home. Sarah Bailey believes more and more developers will build homes including wiring for digital cabling. \"It adds only £1,000 to the cost of an average new four-five bedroom home,\" she says. Buyers would have to invest an additional £20,000 in hardware to control their home remotely. Before long, technology will allow builders to overcome apathy towards environmental measures such as energy saving, Ms Bailey predicts. \"Systems that can be programmed to turn the lights off will help them do their bit for the environment.\" Redrow homes has taken the brave step of building what it believes will be the house of the future at the Museum of Welsh Life, St Fagans in Cardiff. Colin Lewis, managing director of Redrow Homes, says: \"People will want space that they are able to adapt to their changing needs. In this house the staircase is moveable, so the shape and size of rooms can be changed as the family grows.\" The house adjusts its own temperature, recycles water and can use wind power. \"It's not wacky and weird, says Mr Lewis. \"It still makes sense in today's market, although it doesn't look as attractive as some homes of the moment. So if it went on the market you would see some resistance. The house of the future is what homes could look like in 50 years.\" Alisdair Chant, managing director of Berkeley Partnership Homes, agrees: \"Most buyers still want a traditional product. For the public price comes first, then location then design. More innovation will come forward when the unit cost comes down.\" Mr Thompson agrees that cost is a deterrent now, but one that will change when builders achieve economies of scale. Within the next five years mainstream housing will become intelligent and green, he says. Cultural inertia is holding developers back. \"The average house builder will say we're not sure people are ready for this sort of thing yet- that there is no demand. Maybe they're right, but unless we offer choice how will you know?\" For more information: Integer, tel 01923-665-955 or www.integerproject.co.uk; Berkeley Homes, tel 01256-814-314; Laing Homes, tel 0181-207-6000; Redrow Homes, tel 01244-520044."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/1999/sep/10/energy.renewableenergy1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-10T18:33:17Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy and the politicians","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/sep/10/energy.renewableenergy1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/1999/sep/10/energy.renewableenergy1","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy and the politicians","bodyText":"It lights and heats itself using solar energy and wind power. It produces its own water and recycles waste. It causes no pollution or carbon dioxide emissions and is the most energy efficient housing estate in Europe. This is no renewable energy fantasy. Hockerton is home to five families in the Nottinghamshire countryside. But it a rare success story. For every Hockerton, there are thousands of fossil fuel burning developments all over the country. To meet its legally binding commitment to reduce 'greenhouse gas' emissions by 12.5 per cent between 2008 and 2012, Britain needs to develop new forms of renewable energy - solar, wind, and wave power. In spite of Tony Blair's obsession with hi-technology and his hype about Britain leading the world in innovation, the UK is lagging on green energy. Before he lost his post in the latest Government reshuffle, energy minister, John Battle, announced a fund for renewable power sources. It was, he said, the dawning of a new day for solar, wind and wave power. But environmentalists, analysts and businesses involved with renewable energy have heard the rhetoric before. They've seen slogans trotted out and photo opportunities snapped - before the initiatives ebb away on a tide of indifference. The good news for environmentally conscious consumers is that the Government's recent consultation paper on renewables confirmed that ministers are working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10 per cent of UK electricity supplies as soon as possible - 2010 at the latest. The bad news is that not much else is happening. As the influential House of Lords select committee report on renewables put it two months ago: 'The UK's targets are technically feasible but we do not see them being delivered under present policies.' Only seven per cent of UK domestic waste is recycled, against a Government target of 30 per cent by 2010. By next year the Dutch will be recycling 60 per cent of their household waste. Scandanavia rules the waves in Europe when it comes to wave and wind power - derived from off-shore turbines. If the UK's targets for renewable energy are to be met, the contribution from wind power - in particular, off-shore turbines - needs to grow at more than five times the best annual rate achieved in recent years. Few think the Government will meet its self-imposed goal. The contribution from wave power is so low, it is negligible. The same is true for solar power where a handful of enterprising greens have taken matters in to their own hands but have so far received little support from Government - which has spent more than £15bn supporting nuclear power between 1990 and 1995 and £4.5bn subsidising the fossil fuel industries. Less than 1 megawatt of generating capacity is currently derived from solar power and present policies are unlikely to see that figure rise substantially in the near future. Around the world it is a very different story. America, which leads the world with almost 54MW, plans to install 500,000 solar roof-top units over the next few years; Germany, which already has some 11,000 roof-top installations, has just begun a five-year push to install 100,000 more. Japan is installing the equivalent of 2.3m rooftops, in a 4,600 MW programme; Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, India, Taiwan, China and Australia all have fast growing industries. Overall, Britain's record on renewables is so poor that the House of Lords report recommended the creation of 'a strong and proactive renewable energy agency' to force through change. As the Lords put it: 'The UK's 2010 target will require a seven-fold increase in the rate of expanding renewable energy provision throughout the next decade. 'This will require urgent action by the Government to put in place the range of new policies required, together with the sustained leadership to ensure that that targets are delivered through coherent action by all the relevant public bodies.' Just when it is needed most, renewable energy technology is caught in vicious circle. The technology is simple but relatively expensive because the market is still small. Costs will remain high unless they are driven down by large volumes of production - which remain unlikely until prices drop. Environmentalists say market development policies must be implemented to boost green power - with a combination of public and private finance to support enough demand to reduce costs to affordable levels. Bold examples of good practice from government - solar panels on Downing Street, a wind turbine at Chequers - could also stimulate consumer and commercial confidence. Incentives must also be identified to increase the attractiveness of building and purchasing sustainable homes, such as green certificates for house builders and carbon-tax breaks for mortgage lenders. Most western countries and many major banks now offer hefty tax breaks and solar loans. As Mark Johnston, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, puts it: 'It is time poturn the rhetoric into reality. Climate change is now almost universally accepted as one of the gravest problems the planet faces. Fossil fuel industries cause global warming. 'Ministers have international commitments to tackle climate change. The Lords report made it clear that technically and financially we can take the necessary steps. Ministers must now deliver. The future is renewable.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/jan/27/bp","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-27T02:47:43Z","webTitle":"Greens take on BP Amoco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/27/bp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/27/bp","fields":{"headline":"Greens take on BP Amoco","bodyText":"Environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, yesterday claimed shareholder backing for its plan to block controversial plans by BP Amoco to expand its exploration for oil in Alaska. Greenpeace said it intended to halt further development of BP Amoco's Northstar exploration project at the company's annual meeting in April. The prospect of a vote on Northstar comes as BP Amoco is trying to persuade American regulators that its $27bn (£16.5bn) acquisition of Atlantic Richfield should proceed despite concerns that the deal will diminish production competition in Alaska. BP said it was \"dealing with the resolution\" from Greenpeace which is signed by 100 shareholders speaking for about 150,000 shares in the company. It is understood that BP will check the identity and shareholdings of all signatories to the motion, which will take about a week. Greenpeace raised the issue of the Northstar development - which it claims uses risky and untested technology to bring oil ashore - at last year's annual meeting. Since then BP Amoco has proposed to the government that multi-national companies should be allowed to dispense with conventional annual meetings. Greenpeace has managed to exploit the activist approach of some American investors, many of which joined the investor register when BP acquired Amoco in late 1998, to gain support for its hostile motion. The need to attract the backing of more than 100 shareholders means it is very difficult to table resolutions at an annual meeting without company endorsement. One of the US investor groups that has signed up to the Greenpeace motion is Trillium Asset Management - a socially responsible investment organisation which speaks for about $600m, although not all of that is committed to voting in favour of the resolution. Simon Billenness, an analyst with Trillium, said: \"We have yet to see any sign of BP Amoco actually acting on [its] green vision. With this resolution, shareholders in the US and, for the first time in Europe, have a chance to put policy into practice.\" Greenpeace wants BP Amoco to switch the $5bn investment planned for Northstar into a solar energy proposal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2000/sep/14/oil1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2000-09-14T02:36:49Z","webTitle":"As we knew from bombing Serbia: refineries are the key","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/14/oil1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/sep/14/oil1","fields":{"headline":"As we knew from bombing Serbia: refineries are the key","bodyText":"Next Friday is European Car Free Day. The idea, promoted by environmentalists and local authorities, is to encourage people to leave their cars at home. I think the organisers would agree that it's building up rather nicely. Next time green campaigners want to keep cars off the road, they should dress up as truckers or farmers. When seven people tried to blockade a refinery in Essex last year, to highlight the fact that North sea oil is being given away to the companies exploiting it, they were pounced on by police. Some of them were arrested for obstruction even though they were standing on the verge. The truckers and farmers, by contrast, seem to have been able to smash the oil industry almost casually. The oil firms insist that their capitulation has nothing to do with the fact that they too would like to see fuel duties reduced. They can't let their tankers go, they argue, because their drivers have been intimidated. When pressed yesterday, a Shell spokesman explained that on Friday last week, someone threw a traffic cone at one of the company's trucks. Next time anti-capitalism protesters want to bring the entire economic system to a halt, they should threaten it with a piece of plastic. But it is interesting to see how easy it has been, with or without the oil companies' collaboration, to shut the United Kingdom down. If I were a hostile foreign power hoping to bring Britain to its knees, I wouldn't bother with helicopter gunships, genetically engineered bugs or indeed any form of direct combat at all. I would merely do what Nato did in Serbia, and bomb the refineries. After the second world war, the government set out to ensure that Britain would never again be so vulnerable to an economic blockade. Alarmed by the narrowness of our escape from starvation, it set out to revolutionise British agriculture, to reduce our dependence on other nations. Fifty years of farm subsidies have achieved precisely the opposite: far from increasing the area of Britain's farmland producing food for human beings rather than animals, they have decreased it, to just 8%. Far from reducing our imports, they have massively increased them, as we cannot now farm without vast quantities of fossil fuel, fertilisers and pesticides. As the writer Marion Shoard has pointed out, if Britain had really wanted to ensure its food security, it would have invested in horses. Other economic sectors have been exposed to disruption by similarly clear-sighted policies. As one of my correspondents, Thomas Powell, has argued, rail had to be replaced as the principal means of transport in Britain because it was too durable. Neither the tracks nor the rolling stock wore out rapidly, with the result that turnover, and therefore profitability, were limited. The railways had to be destroyed and replaced with a system that needed continual renewal. Unsustainability is not a by- product of our road-based transport system, but its primary objective. While railways, like roads, are vulnerable to bombing, they require far less fossil fuel to run. Indeed, with electrification, in theory they could - like most of our key services - be powered entirely by renewable energy. But today, like every other economic sector in Britain, they can be rendered inoperable simply by means of a minor disruption in the supply of a commodity largely controlled by foreign powers. Neither government nor industry appears to be worried by the fact that our profligate energy use means our supplies of natural gas are running out. When the North sea's stocks disappear, they will be replaced by gas transported to Britain via the new \"Interconnector\" and pumped back into the depleted submarine reservoirs. It looks neat, until you realise that Britain's access to its primary means of power generation will depend on a pipeline running all the way from the Caspian sea - surely the most strategically exposed energy-supply scheme ever conceived. Britain, in other words, is vulnerable because it is unsustainable. These concerns might look comfortably remote. Britain is not currently threatened by any foreign power. As members of Nato, far removed from the nations in which we have waged war, we would seem to have little cause to worry about invasion. But if the government really believes that Britain is invulnerable, why is it spending £23bn on something called \"defence\" this year? Why has it been engaged in urgent discussions about whether or not our armed forces are capable of responding? I find it hard to understand how a government that claims to be so concerned about defence seems unable to grasp that it doesn't matter how much we spend on our armed forces, if the economic life of the nation can be terminated by taking out Britain's 15 oil refineries. In fact, it might not even take hostile action to destroy us. While oil companies have sought to talk up their share prices by insisting that they have endless supplies on tap, evidence is beginning to emerge that world oil production will peak then start to slide within 20 years. If we don't do something about it pretty fast, Britain will grind to a halt whether or not our refineries are attacked. So, quite aside from the environmental consequences of our profligate fossil fuel use, switching to dispersed self-generating power sources is surely an urgent strategic priority. The defence of the realm, in other words, depends upon investing in renewable energy. But this government, which knows everything about tactics and nothing about strategy, has so far done as little as possible to encourage such investment. While Denmark is aiming to produce 50% of its power from wind by 2050 and Swedish researchers have developed new cells that will bring the price of solar energy down to the price of oil within 10 years, Britain, the windiest nation in Europe, has shown that it regards the issue with contempt. First the government appointed Lord Marshall - who, as chairman of British Airways, lobbied hard against proposals to tax aviation fuel - as head of its energy tax review team. Then, last month, Tony Blair persuaded the G8 summit to elect as head of its global task force on renewable energy the chairman of Shell, a company doing its utmost to increase sales of fossil fuels.

The ideal advocate of change - tackling the technology issue as well as the economic, environmental and social costs of different energy systems - Bob was a leading figure in alternative energy. He chaired the British Photovoltaics Association in 1994-95 and during the millennium year. He was also a member of the solar energy advisory committee and the technology foresight energy committee, which advise the British government. In 1994 he led the 12th European Photovoltaic Conference and was involved in subsequent conferences, including preparation for next year in Glasgow. Bob was born and brought up outside Leeds, and after graduating in physics from Imperial College took a doctorate there in solid state physics. In the mid-60s, he joined the research staff at Windscale (now Sellafield), focusing on nuclear safety before moving briefly to Newcastle university. He joined Newcastle polytechnic, now the University of Northumbria at Newcastle (UNN), in 1971. From there, he ran the Newcastle Photovoltaics Applications Centre. He wrote and edited 12 books, seven conference proceedings, 200 papers in refereed journals and major conferences and more than 100 confidential commercial reports. His early work at UNN focused on thin film solar cells for terrestrial use exploring high efficiency coatings. By 1978, Bob was working on satellite solar panels. Knowing that it was difficult to generate money in new universities for fundamental research, he concentrated on developing hardware for testing solar cells. He was a friendly scholar insisting on tolerance, even of views that questioned his own scientific rationalism. He had a waspish sense of humour, accompanied by laughter emanating from somewhere between the end of his beard and the beginning of his chest. Northumbria's solar-clad building stands as a monument to Bob, but his finest memorial is his work in creating opportunities for third world graduate students to study applied physics.

It is axiomatic that the DTI will resist anything which might pose a threat to the GDP. Solar power is perceived as such a threat, since it could seriously undermine the power industry. For example, buildings account for 47% of energy use in the UK. In their present form, photovoltaic cells applied to buildings could cut that consumption by 50%. The fact that this would reduce UK carbon dioxide emissions by 24% carries little weight against the loss of GDP. The real nightmare for the DTI is that, within the next 20 years, solar cell technology could make buildings wholly independent of the grid. The position here is so hostile to solar cell technology that even the flagship British company Pilkington has been obliged to locate its photovoltaic production in Germany. Of course any shortfall in GDP could rapidly be wiped out if the government created favourable conditions for the production of the next generation of titanium-based solar cells. There is no doubt that this will be the prime energy source for the next century. Developments in Switzerland already point to dramatic reductions in unit costs. Here is a classic case of overlapping virtuous circles. We buy-in to a burgeoning industry; we export to developing countries, especially China; we achieve security of supply; and, most importantly, we achieve a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. As for the treasury, to suggest tax breaks is tantamount to treason. Prof PF Smith, Royal Institute of British Architects • Polly Toynbee ignores the critical issue of how much solar energy is available. In the winter in the UK, when demand for electrical energy is at its highest, the solar resource is such that any photovoltaic module will produce only 1/24th of the energy it could produce if it operated continuously at its peak output. This fundamental limitation means that photovoltaic power will only ever be one component of UK electricity generation. Even in tropical locations where the solar resource is spread more evenly through out the year it is hard to imagine how developed economies can be operated with only the very limited electrical energy available from photovoltaic systems. If the reductions in emissions necessary to stabilise the climate are to be achieved then other hard choices will need to be made in terms of energy conservation, development of other renewable generation (eg windpower), and the most effective use of fossil fuels. To imply that solar photovoltaic generation offers a panacea is quite incorrect and does not help us address the question of how to meet the energy needs of the world's population while maintaining the environment Prof N Jenkins, UMIST jenkins@fs5.ee.umist.ac.uk • Even in the depth of winter, my British-made heat-exchanger panel provides a tank full of water at 55-60C on every day when there is a couple of hours' sunshine around mid-day (actually quite frequent, even in Manchester). As Ms Toynbee implies, photovoltaics would be even more efficient.

He also promises to provide 80% of households with internet connections by 2004. Health Mr Dobson, a former health secretary, has launched plans for a London-wide lottery to raise up to £100m a year for health and education schemes in the capital. He says he will channel money raised from a weekly lottery to health and education projects such as specialist hospital equipment, care for old people, summer schools and homework clubs. He also wants a dedicated medical officer for London. Environment Mr Dobson argues that practical sustainable development comes through improving public transport and regenerating deprived areas - partly through reducing crime. His stated environmental priorities are to defend the green belt and promote the recycling of land through conversion or rebuilding on brownfield sites. Business Wants to see corporate tax on London firms cut as a way of increasing investment and jobs and has set a target of 100,000 more jobs in London within the next four years. He will also set up a task force to tackle black and Asian unemployment. Steven Norris, Conservative Housing In a move well to the left of his fellow Conservatives, Steven Norris promises to demand a higher London weighting, from an average of £3,000 to £6,000, on the salaries of public sector workers to help them meet rising house prices. He also proposes to spearhead a new right-to-buy drive, encouraging London boroughs sell council homes at discounted prices to tenants who wish to buy. Health Will appoint a \"commissioner for public health\" and also ensure that London's streets are properly cleaned and free of rubbish. Environment Pledges to promote brownfield redevelopment and champion green jobs and, like Ken Livingstone, will set a target of creating 10,000 private-sector \"green jobs\" by 2005. He will also draw up a noise map and require commercial premises to invest in proper sound-proofing. Business Strongly opposed to Britain's entry into the euro, Mr Norris accepts that it would be \"wholly unproductive for the mayor to obstruct\" the single currency if London business comprehensively endorsed the single currency. Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat Housing Will campaign for more London weighting for public sector pay and introduce a \"cost of living index\" to expose how difficult it is for public sector workers to live in the capital. One of the Liberal Democrat candidate's big ideas is to set up community banks in deprived areas. Part of their role will cover schemes such as shared ownership of houses. Town managers will also be created to revitalise high streets. Health Proposes a London-wide audit of hosital beds to ensure the government keeps its promise to increase the number of hospital beds until the capital reaches the EU average. Environment Ms Kramer promises to open a state-of-the-art recycling plant to help promote a sustainable London. She will set a target to reduce traffic to 10% below 1990 levels by 2010 in order to reduce air pollution. Following the example of a house in Peckham which has produced more than 45% of its electricity needs from solar power, Ms Kramer aims to introduce planning guidance encouraging new homes and businesses to align their roofs to take advantage of solar energy when it becomes commercially viable in the near future. Business Ms Kramer's community banks will offer special help to small businesses, while giving women a genuine option to work through childcare initiatives will form a crucial part of her regeneration strategy. She also wants to break down large GLA contracts to enable smaller London businesses to compete for them. Ken Livingstone, independent Housing Ken Livingstone will hold a three-month inquiry into London's needs for new affordable low cost housing and he promises work with business and the Empty Homes Agency in setting a target to reclaim the 100,000 empty homes across the capital. Mr Livingstone also says he will get the London Development Agency working with the Rough Sleepers Unit to encourage training for homeless people \"to help them into employment and off the streets\". Health Wants to meet the secretary of state for health \"within a month\" to discuss London's health needs. Proposes a Healthy London Commission to help the mayor and assembly draw up a \"health improvement programme\" for London. Will maintain \"a stable funding base\" for London's drug services and draw up \"a London-wide strategy to reduce harm from drugs\". Environment Promises to establish a sustainable development unit in the mayor's office and to set targets to recycle 25% of all household waste and establish 10,000 \"green\" jobs by 2005. Also proposes to draw up a biodiversity action plan to give full protection to London's wildlife sites, and save Rainham Marshes from development. Business Mr Livingstone's remark that the World Trade Organisation would not be welcome in London attracted much publicity, but he has otherwise assiduously cultivated support from London business as his manifesto's rhetoric (he will \"support jobs and competitiveness in London\") suggests. He will work with the London Development Agency to develop initiatives to back small businesses established by London's ethnic minority communities and ask it to prioritise new community businesses as part of the capital's regeneration.
